INDEX


PART 1

Item 1.    Business

Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark) is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware in 1979. Its primary subsidiaries are American Income Life Insurance Company (American Income), Liberty National Life Insurance Company (Liberty),
Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company (Globe), United American Insurance Company (United American), and United Investors Life Insurance Company (United Investors).

Torchmark’s website is: www.torchmarkcorp.com. Torchmark makes available free of charge through its website, its annual report on
Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The following table presents Torchmark’s business by primary
marketing distribution method.

Additional information
concerning industry segments may be found in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

and in

Note 13—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Insurance

Life Insurance

Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries write a variety of nonparticipating ordinary life insurance products. These include traditional and interest sensitive whole-life insurance, term life insurance, and other life insurance.
The following table presents selected information about Torchmark’s life products.

The distribution methods for
life insurance products include sales by direct response, exclusive agents and independent agents. These methods are discussed in more depth under the heading

Marketing.

The following table presents life annualized premium in force by
distribution method.

Health insurance

Torchmark offers supplemental limited-benefit health insurance products that include
hospital/surgical plans, cancer, and accident plans sold to individuals under age 65. These policies are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own or to provide affordable, limited-benefit coverage to individuals without
access to more comprehensive coverage. Medicare Supplements are also offered to enrollees in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. All Medicare Supplement plans are standardized by Federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles
and co-payments not paid by Medicare. Late in 2005, the Company began marketing a new Medicare Part D prescription drug policy for which coverage began in 2006.

Health plans are offered through the Company’s exclusive and independent agents and direct response, with the United American agencies being the leading
writers in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, selling predominantly hospital/surgical plans. As shown in the charts below, net sales of limited-benefit plans exceeded net sales of Medicare Supplements in all years of the
three-year-period ended December 31, 2005, but Medicare Supplement premium in force exceeded that of limited-benefit plans during each year of the same period. These data reflect the change in product mix being sold from predominantly Medicare
Supplements in years preceding 2003 to predominantly limited-benefit plans in the more current period.



The following table presents health insurance net sales information for the three years ended December 31, 2005 by
product category.

The following table presents supplemental health annualized premium information for the three years ended
December 31, 2005 by product category.

The number of individual health
policies in force was 1.70 million, 1.64 million, and 1.62 million at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

The following table presents supplemental health annualized premium in force for the three years ended December 31, 2005 by marketing (distribution) method.

Annuities

Annuity products offered include single-premium deferred annuities, flexible-premium
deferred annuities, and variable annuities. In recent years Torchmark has deemphasized the marketing of annuity products, and annuities in 2005 comprise less than 1% of premium income and less than 3% of insurance underwriting margin.

Pricing

Premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency,
and expenses, all of which are generally based on Company experience



and on projected investment earnings. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent,
through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products. Profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from
that which is required for policy reserves.

Collections for annuity
products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are
earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts.

Underwriting

The underwriting standards of each Torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management. Each company uses information from
the application and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different
rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage or rejected.

Reserves

The life insurance policy reserves reflected in Torchmark’s financial statements
as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These reserves, with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover
policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by
Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. A list of the assumptions used in the calculation of Torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements (

See

Note 5

—

Future

Policy Benefit Reserves

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are
increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments.

Investments

The
nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws that generally permit investments in qualified municipal, state, and federal government obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, real
estate, and mortgages where the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the amount of the loan. The investments of Torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Fixed maturities represented
94% of total investments at December 31, 2005. (

)

Competition

Torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there
are insurance companies competing with Torchmark, no individual company dominates any of Torchmark’s life or health markets.

Torchmark’s health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred
provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements.

Management believes Torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows Torchmark to have
competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.



Regulation

Insurance.

Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The laws of the
various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms,
approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. They are also required to file
detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined periodically by
one or more of the supervisory agencies.

Risk Based Capital.

The
NAIC requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory
attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. All Torchmark insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula.

Guaranty Assessments.

State guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance
companies into a fund which is used, in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company, to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders. The amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of
these unsatisfied obligations in each state. Assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes.

Holding Company.

States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within
their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Alabama,
Delaware, Indiana, Missouri, New York, and Texas.

Insurance holding
company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.

Personnel

At the end of 2005, Torchmark had 2,169 employees and 2,361 licensed employees under sales contracts.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Product marketplace and
operational risks:

The insurance industry is a mature, regulated
industry, populated by many firms. Torchmark operates in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks.

Life Insurance marketplace risk:

The life insurance industry is highly competitive and could limit Torchmark’s ability to gain or maintain market
share.

Competition by product price and for market share is generally strong in the life insurance industry, but is less so in Torchmark’s life insurance niche markets. In recent years, most life insurers have
targeted the smaller, highly competitive, higher-income market by offering asset accumulation products. Torchmark’s market has remained the middle income market, offering individually-sold protection life insurance, which is less competitive
because the market is larger with fewer competing insurers and with less price sensitivity than the higher income, asset accumulation marketplace.



Torchmark’s life insurance markets are subject to risks of general economic
conditions.

Because Torchmark serves the middle income market for individual protection life insurance, competition is primarily from alternative uses of the customer’s disposable income. In times of economic
downturns that affect employment levels, potential customers may be less likely to buy policies and policyholders may fail to pay premiums.

Torchmark’s life products are sold in selected niche markets. The Company is at risk should any of these markets
diminish.

Torchmark has two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches; labor union members and military officers. While both of these markets are known to have strong sales affinity, the contraction
of the size of either market could adversely affect sales. In addition, because the military-focused agency is independent and uses other life insurance underwriters in addition to Torchmark, Torchmark has little control over marketing strategies of
that agency, which could result in less-than favorable sales results for Torchmark.

The development and maintenance of Torchmark’s various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales.

Because the Company’s life insurance sales are primarily made to
individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support
growth of sales in this market is critical. For agents, adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities, and that also motivates them to increase sales is very important. In direct response, continuous development of
new offerings and cost efficiency are key. Less than optimum execution of these strategies will in time lead to less than optimum growth in sales and ultimately in profits.

Health Insurance marketplace risk:

Congress could make changes to the Medicare program which could impact Torchmark’s Medicare Supplement business.

Medicare
Supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of Torchmark’s in force health insurance business. Because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the Medicare program, it is likely that changes will be
made to the Medicare program by Congress from time to time. These changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business.

Torchmark’s Medicare Supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers.

The Medicare
Supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior

-

aged health care industry that provide alternative traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans. The success of
these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional Medicare supplement insurance.

Torchmark’s Medicare Supplement business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future
sales.

In recent years, price competition in the traditional Medicare supplement market has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to under price new
sales in order to gain market share in the short term. Torchmark believes these practices are not in the best interest of the Company or consumers and has elected not to compete on those terms, which has negatively affected sales. Should these
industry practices continue, it is likely that Torchmark’s sales of this health product will remain depressed.

Torchmark’s health business is at risk in the event of government-sponsored under-age-65 health insurance.

Currently,
Torchmark’s leading health sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65. These products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees. If in the
future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65, demand for this product would likely decline. Given the high cost and political challenges of such a program, Torchmark believes this is a low-level risk in the
foreseeable future.



Changes in mortality, economic conditions, or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation
and profitability.

The Company’s insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality, morbidity, persistency, and healthcare utilization that we experience. The resulting levels that occur may be significantly
different from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. Significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income. However, the Company’s actuaries continually test expected to actual results.

Torchmark’s ability to pay dividends or service any of its
debt or preferred securities is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company.

Torchmark’s insurance company subsidiaries, its principal sources of cash flow, periodically declare and
distribute dividends on their common stock and preferred stock held by Torchmark, the holding company. Torchmark’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, principal and interest on any debt security, or dividends on any preferred stock
security is affected by the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the holding company these dividends. The insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions, applicable to insurance companies, that limit
the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to the holding company. For example, under certain state insurance laws, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as
reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. Additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations, excluding capital gains and losses, or 10% of
statutory surplus without regulatory approval.

Torchmark can give no
assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other
amounts payable to Torchmark by its subsidiaries. Additionally, the inability to obtain approval of the previously mentioned premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact the
profitability, and thus the ability of Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries to declare and distribute dividends.

A ratings downgrade could negatively affect Torchmark’s ability to compete.

Ratings are an important factor in Torchmark’s
competitive position. Rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including the Company’s insurance subsidiaries. While ratings are less important in the middle-income market than in markets
focused on higher incomes or the group market, a downgrade in the ratings of Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products.

Rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the
considered factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside of the Company’s control.

Investment Risk:

The Company’s investments are subject to market risks.

Torchmark’s invested assets are subject to the customary risks of
defaults and changes in market values. Factors that may affect the default rates and market values of invested assets include interest rate levels, financial market performance, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances
affecting the businesses of individual issuers. Significant increases in interest rates could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio, reflecting unrealized fair value losses. This risk is mitigated by
Torchmark’s operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the long-term nature of its offsetting life policy reserve liabilities and by Torchmark’s strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to
liquidate investments prior to maturity. Individual investments are also subject to impairment and write-down, due to adverse factors affecting that investment’s particular issuer, business, or industry.

A decline in interest rates could negatively affect
income.

Declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the crediting rates paid on outstanding policies. While
Torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, the Company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads.



Significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are
available to issuers. These calls could result in a decline in the Company’s investment income as reinvestment of these proceeds would be at the prevailing lower rates.

Regulatory risk:

Regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.

Insurance companies are subject to government regulation in each of the states
in which they conduct business. State agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business, which may include premium rates, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, and
permitted investments. Government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders. Insurance laws, regulations, and policies currently affecting Torchmark and its subsidiaries may change at any
time, possibly having an adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, The Company cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives.

Changes in taxation could negatively affect our income.

Changes in the way the insurance industry is taxed or increases in tax rates
could increase the Company’s tax burden and negatively affect its income.

Litigation risk:

Litigation could result in
substantial judgments against the Company or its subsidiaries.

A number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which Torchmark does business involving the insurers’ sales
practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. These lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material
amounts of punitive damages. In some states, including Alabama, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. This discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit.
Torchmark, like other insurers, is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty.

Natural disaster risk:

Torchmark’s business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event.

The marketplaces of
Torchmark’s major subsidiaries are national in scope for all but one, which is multi-state. Because the Company’s insurance policies in force are relatively low-face amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders, the likelihood that a
large portion of the Company’s policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is further diluted. As a result, it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium
collection in more than a small portion of Torchmark’s markets. In addition, the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan back-up
administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster. The Company also has outside contracts for off-site backup information systems and record keeping in the event of a disaster.

Item 1B. Disclosure of Unresolved Staff Comments

As of December 31, 2005, Torchmark had no unresolved staff comments.



Item 2.    Real Estate

Torchmark, through its subsidiaries, owns or leases buildings that are used in the normal course of business. Liberty owns a 487,000 square foot building in Birmingham, Alabama which currently serves as Liberty’s, United
Investors’, and Torchmark’s home office. Approximately 160,000 square feet of this building is leased or available for lease to unrelated tenants by Liberty. Liberty also operates from 48 company-owned district offices used for agency
sales personnel.

United American owns and is the sole occupant of a
140,000 square foot facility, located in McKinney, Texas (a north Dallas suburb).

Globe owns a 300,000 square foot office building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma of which Globe occupies 56,000 square feet as its home office and the remaining space is either leased or available for lease. Globe also owns an 80,000 square foot
office building in Oklahoma City. Further, Globe owns a 112,000 square foot facility located in Oklahoma City which houses the Globe direct response operation.

American Income owns and is the sole occupant of an office building located in Waco, Texas. The building is a two-story structure containing approximately 72,000
square feet of usable floor space. American Income also owns a 43,000 square foot facility located in Waco which houses the American Income direct response operation.

Liberty and Globe also lease district office space for their agency sales personnel.

Torchmark believes that its owned and leased properties are suitable and adequate for
its current business operations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged
wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. A number of such actions involving Torchmark’s subsidiary Liberty also names Torchmark as a defendant.
Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark’s
financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This
bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as Alabama and Mississippi.

Many of these lawsuits involve claims for punitive damages in state courts of Alabama and Mississippi. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive
damage awards continue to occur bearing little or no relation to actual damages awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark has substantial business, particularly Alabama and Mississippi, creating the potential for unpredictable material
adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit. As of December 31, 2005, Liberty was a party to approximately 76 active lawsuits (which included no employment-related cases and excluded interpleaders), 61 of which were Alabama proceedings and 4
of which were Mississippi proceedings in which punitive damages were sought.

As previously reported in Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q, Liberty National Life Insurance Company is a party to a number of lawsuits (both a large number of lawsuits brought by individual plaintiffs and class action litigation with extremely
broad class periods and relief sought) involving allegations of racially discriminatory pricing in the sale of insurance to African Americans prior to 1966. The litigation began with the December 8, 1999 filing of

Moore v. Liberty National
Life Insurance Company

, Case No. CV-99-BU-3262-S in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Over 29 race-distinct mortality cases with approximately 2,000 named plaintiffs have been consolidated with the

Moore

case



(Master Case No. 2:02-CV-02741-UWC) and are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, with one pending Alabama Circuit Court case
(

Baldwin v. Liberty National Life Insurance Company

, Case No. CV-00-684) stayed pending a disposition of the

Moore

case.

The previously-reported December 5, 2005 trial date fixed by the U.S. District Court for

Moore

was reset by that Court to January 18, 2006. On
January 18, 2006, all parties to

Moore

submitted a Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement and a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement in that case to the District Court. After a hearing, the District Court
entered an Order Preliminarily Approving Proposed Settlement on January 25, 2006. In the Order, the District Court preliminarily approved the Proposed Settlement Agreement; conditionally certified a settlement class defined as “All black
Americans who have (or had at the time of the policy’s termination) an ownership or other legal interest in an industrial life insurance policy or burial policy issued by Liberty National Life Insurance Company, or one of its former
subsidiaries, Service Insurance Company of Alabama, or Burial Service Insurance Company of Alabama on or before January 10, 1966, at a higher rate than similar plans offered to similarly situated white Americans”; certified the class
representatives and class counsel; found that the claims in the case were primarily equitable and that the primary relief under the proposed Settlement was injunctive and equitable, with incidental monetary relief in the form of restitution not to
exceed $6 million in the aggregate; approved and directed the giving of notice to class members in the manner and form set out in the Proposed Settlement Agreement beginning February 3, 2006; and fixed March 31, 2006 as the date for the
fairness hearing. Pursuant to the Order, Liberty commenced dissemination of notice to class members on February 3, 2006. If approved, the Settlement will substantially resolve all class action issues in race-distinct pricing litigation at
Liberty, except for certain consolidated individual claims for mental anguish and punitive damages previously asserted by approximately 2,000 individual plaintiffs, which claims are expressly excluded from the proposed Settlement. The Company
intends to vigorously defend those claims. Additional information regarding the race-distinct mortality/dual pricing litigation can be found in the Company’s prior Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q.

As previously reported in Form 10-Q, United American Insurance Company has been named
as a defendant in purported class action litigation filed on September 16, 2004, in the Circuit Court of Saline County, Arkansas on behalf of the Arkansas purchasers of association group health insurance policies or certificates issued by
United American through Heartland Alliance of America Association and Farm & Ranch Healthcare, Inc. (

Smith and Ivie v. Collingsworth, et al.,

CV2004-742-2). The plaintiffs assert claims for fraudulent concealment, breach of contract,
common law liability for non-disclosure, breach of fiduciary duties, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and violation of Arkansas law and the rules and regulations of the Arkansas Insurance
Department. Declaratory, injunctive and equitable relief, as well as actual and punitive damages are sought by the plaintiffs. United American removed the case from the Saline County Circuit Court to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
of Arkansas, but the District Court ordered the case back to the Circuit Court on December 21, 2005. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied United American’s petition for permission to appeal the District
Court’s decision on January 25, 2006.

Liberty National Life
Insurance Company and an unrelated Glendale, California mortuary were named as defendants in a purported class action litigation filed December 8, 2005 in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County, California (

Gibson v. Liberty National Life
Insurance Company

, Case No. BC344178) on behalf of California holders of certain funeral services insurance policies. The plaintiff in

Gibson

asserts claims for breach of contractual duty to pay a covered claim under a funeral services
insurance policy, breach of the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing by unreasonably failing to pay and/or delaying payments of insurance benefits, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair business practices in violation of
California Business and Professions Code Section 17000 et seq. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified compensatory and general damages, exemplary damages, injunctive and declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees and costs.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matter was submitted to a vote of shareholders, through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of 2005.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

How Torchmark Views Its
Operations:

Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households
throughout the United States. Torchmark views its operations by segments, which are the major insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their
common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.

Insurance Product Line Segments.

As fully described in

Note 13

—

Business Segments

in the

Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,

the product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and benefit administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance
policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the
measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:

Premium revenue

Less:

Policy obligations

Policy acquisition costs

Investment Segment.

The investment segment involves the management of Torchmark’s capital resources, including investments and
the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Torchmark’s measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:

Net investment income

Less:

Interest credited to net policy liabilities

Financing costs

Torchmark’s operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.

Summary of Operations:

Torchmark’s net income
increased 6% or $27 million to $495 million in 2005, and 9% or $38 million to $469 million in 2004. The growth in earnings in both periods came primarily from the life insurance segment, although the investment and health segments contributed
significantly in 2004. Health margins improved in 2004, but were relatively flat in 2005. Excess investment income declined for the first time in ten years in 2005, compressed by a flattening yield curve in that year.

The life insurance segment added $29 million to the 2005 increase in pretax earnings,
and $28 million to the 2004 increase. The 2005 growth in life insurance resulted from margin improvements and 5% premium growth, although there was a decline in sales volume. Growth in 2004 was also a result of increases in premium income and
margins. Life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption

Life

Insurance.

Pretax health profits rose 6% in 2004 to $175 million but rose 1% in 2005 to $177 million. Health premium declined 3% in 2005, as competition in Torchmark’s
Medicare Supplement business has continued to dampen health sales. Health premium income rose 1% in 2004. Premium collected in the first policy year rose 13% in 2004, but declined 11% in 2005. Health underwriting margin was flat in 2005 after having
improved in 2004. The 2004 improvements were largely a result of reductions in loss ratios on a closed block of cancer business. This block had contributed to declines in margins in recent years prior to 2004. See the discussion under

Health
Insurance

for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.

Torchmark has previously stated that it offers annuities, but does not plan to emphasize annuity products, favoring life insurance instead. See the caption

Annuities

for further discussion.



The investment segment’s pretax profitability declined $6 million in 2005 after increasing $13 million in
2004 and $26 million in 2003. The low long-term interest rates available for new investments since 2002 have caused Torchmark’s average portfolio yield to decline in each successive year, restricting growth in net investment income and excess
investment income. Yields on new fixed-maturity investments have been lower than the average portfolio yield since January 1, 2003. In 2005 and late 2004, excess investment income was further compressed as short-term rates rose with no meaningful
change in long-term rates. The increase in short-term rates caused short-term financing costs to increase and the income spread on Torchmark’s fixed-to-variable interest-rate swaps to narrow. See the analysis of excess investment income and
investment activities under the caption

Investments

for a more detailed discussion.

Total revenues rose 2% in 2005 to $3.1 billion. In 2004, total revenues increased 5% to $3.07 billion from $2.93 billion in 2003. The life premium increase was the primary contributor to revenue growth in both periods, although
net investment income also contributed to the revenue growth in both periods.

In 2005, Torchmark had immaterial after-tax realized investment gains compared with gains of $14 million in 2004 and losses of $2 million in 2003. Under the caption

Realized Gains and Losses

in this report, Torchmark presents a
complete analysis and discussion of its realized gains and losses. Also, as explained in

Note 13—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, Torchmark management does not consider realized gains and
losses to be a component of its core insurance operations or its operating segments. However, they can have a material positive or negative impact on net income.

In each of the years 2003 through 2005, Torchmark’s net income was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring
nonoperating items. Torchmark management does not view these items as components of its core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. A discussion of these items follows.

In 2005, Torchmark recorded an after-tax charge of $955 thousand ($1.5
million pretax) pertaining to litigation. This litigation involved net settlements after expenses primarily in three significant legal matters: Torchmark’s race-distinct mortality/dual-pricing litigation, its class-action cancer case, and the
Waddell & Reed litigation. All of these cases relate to litigation arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to Torchmark’s current operations. Of this pre-tax amount, $13.5 million is recorded as “Other
income” and $15 million is recorded as “Other operating expense” in the 2005

Consolidated Statement of Operations

. For more information on these litigation items, see

Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. Also in 2005, Torchmark recorded a $16 million settlement benefit from an Internal Revenue Service examination covering several years. More information on this tax settlement is provided in

Note
8—Income Taxes

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

. Additionally, a noncash after-tax charge of $369 thousand was recorded as a result of the extension in the term of a previously granted stock option for a senior
officer upon retirement. The option extension expense was recorded as administrative expense in the 2005

Consolidated Statement of Operations

. The tax settlement reduced tax expense.

As of January 1, 2004, Torchmark adopted

Statement of Position 03-1 (SOP 03-1)

,
an accounting rule concerning guaranteed minimum policy benefits on variable annuities. The adoption of this standard resulted in a one-time after-tax charge of $7.2 million recorded as a change in accounting principle. Also, during 2004, Torchmark
received a refund of state income taxes in the amount of $3.0 million, after Federal tax. This refund resulted from the settlement of certain state tax issues concerning a discontinued operation in the mid-1990s. The refund reduced income tax
expense in the 2004

Consolidated Statement of Operations

.

In
2003, net income was impacted by two nonrecurring items. First, Torchmark sold an airplane and recognized a pretax loss of $.8 million. In the

Consolidated Statements of Operations,

this item was included as an administrative expense.
Secondly, the settlement of a Federal tax issue resulted in interest due Torchmark in the pretax amount of $4.3 million. This item was included in investment income on the

Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Because the tax issue covered a
period of many years, the interest income on the tax refund exceeded the refund itself. After expenses, the effect of the tax refund on earnings was immaterial. Significant gains or losses from non-investment property or significant interest income
from non-investment sources are unusual for Torchmark.



Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 and was reaffirmed at its July 28,
2005 Board of Director’s meeting. With no specified authorization amount, management determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Company’s excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The
majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the Company’s tax benefit are used to repurchase additional
shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2005.

A discussion of each of Torchmark’s segments
follows.

Life insurance.

Life insurance is
Torchmark’s largest insurance segment. Its premium is also growing at a greater rate than the other insurance segments. In 2005, life premium represented 59% of total premium, compared with 56% in 2004 and 55% in 2003. Life underwriting income
before other income and administrative expense represented 67% of the total in 2005, compared with 65% in both 2004 and 2003. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income
attributable to the investment segment.

Life insurance premium rose 5%
to $1.5 billion in 2005 and 6% in 2004 to $1.4 billion. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows.

LIFE INSURANCE

Premium by Distribution Method

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Torchmark management uses four
statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: “annualized premium in force,” “annualized premium issued,” “net sales,” and “first-year collected premium.” Annualized
premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is
an indicator of growth in



premium revenue. Annualized premium issued (sold) is that amount of annualized premium in force added from new sales in a given period, and is an indicator of the
acceleration of premium growth. Net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium
is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. Management believes that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to gross annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium
collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium
is expected to be added to premium income in the future. Annualized life premium in force was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of 4% over $1.5 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.4 billion at December 31,
2003.

The following table sets forth net sales information for each of
the last three years by distribution method.

The

Direct Response Group

is Torchmark’s leading writer of life insurance. Marketing is conducted primarily through direct mail, but also through co-op mailings, television and consumer magazine advertising, and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups, unions
and associations. This group markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles, their parents, and other adults over age 50. The Direct Response operation accounted for almost 29% of Torchmark’s life insurance premium during 2005, the
largest of any distribution group. Life premium rose 10% in 2005 and 10% in 2004.

This group’s focus is on its juvenile life product. Not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales, but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds. Parents and grandparents of
juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by Direct Response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both the juveniles and their parents are low-acquisition cost targets for
sales of additional coverage over time. Torchmark



expects that sales to the juvenile market and their parents will continue as one of this group’s premier markets. Management believes that the Direct Response
Unit is the largest U.S. writer of juvenile direct response life insurance.

While the Direct Response group experienced strong growth in sales in 2003 and 2004, as evidenced by increases in both net sales and first-year collected premium, sales growth was not as strong in 2005. Net sales rose 28% in 2003 to $97
million and 14% in 2004 to $111 million, but increased 1% in 2005 to $112 million. First year collected premium grew 24% in 2003 and 19% in 2004, but rose 3% to $77 million in 2005. It should be noted that the volumes measured by both of these
indicators in 2005 exceeded comparable amounts in the two strong-growth prior periods (2003 and 2004). Due to the nature of Torchmark’s Direct Response business, the rate of sales growth can vary from year to year. However, growth in Direct
Response life premium has trended upward in a relatively stable manner, and the premium growth rate has averaged an increase of 11% over the past ten years.

The

American Income Exclusive Agency

focuses on members of labor unions, credit unions, and other associations for its life insurance sales. It is a high
profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios. Life premium for this agency rose 9% to $380 million in 2005, after having increased 11% in 2004. Net sales declined 4% in 2005 to $84 million from $88 million in 2004. Net
sales were $97 million in 2003, resulting in a decrease of 9% in 2004. First-year collected premium also declined 4% in 2005, after having increased 5% in 2004 and 19% in 2003. As in the case of all of Torchmark’s agency distribution systems,
continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count. The American Income agent count was 2,027 at December 31, 2005 compared with 2,090 a year earlier, declining 3%. The agent count declined 9% in 2004 from 2,291
at year end 2003. In its efforts to recruit new agents, Torchmark recently implemented a new incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business. Additionally, the Company continues to
utilize its systematic, centralized internet recruiting program to add new agents.

The

Liberty National Exclusive Agency

distribution system markets its life products to primarily middle-income customers in Southeastern states, but has recently expanded into several other states. Liberty’s life
premium declined slightly in both 2005 and 2004 compared with the respective prior year. Annualized life premium in force was $318 million at December 31, 2005, flat with 2004 after having declined 1% in 2004 from 2003. Life premium sales for this
agency, in terms of net sales, were $47 million in 2005, representing a decrease of 4% in 2005 after having decreased 8% in 2004. First-year collected premium declined 9% in 2005 to $36 million. First-year collected premium was flat in 2004 with the
prior year at $40 million.

Growth in the Liberty Agency’s sales and
premium volume are highly dependent on growth in the agency force. However, this agency has experienced volatility in its agency force in the past two years. Liberty had 1,781 producing agents at year end 2005, compared with 1,638 at year end 2004,
an increase of 9%. But producing agents declined approximately 15% in 2004, the primary factor in sales declines in both 2004 and 2005. In the latter part of 2003, the agent’s compensation system was restructured to not only reward production
and policy persistency, but also to encourage retention of productive agents. However, the recruiting of new agents was neglected, a primary cause in the 2004 decline in agent count. In late 2004, Liberty implemented initiatives similar to those of
American Income to recruit new agents, primarily through use of the internet. The 2005 increase in producing agents is believed to have resulted from these efforts. As these agents become more seasoned, they should become more productive. Management
believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems. Management also expects that the increased sales from a larger and more
productive agency force will lead to an acceleration in premium growth.

Liberty’s life underwriting margins have improved steadily over the past three years. As a percentage of life premium, margins rose from 22% in 2003 to 24% in 2004 and then to 26% in 2005. These margin improvements resulted primarily
from the reductions in acquisition costs due to the above-mentioned revisions in agents’ compensation. Improved persistency resulting from a 2003 change in collection procedure was also a factor.



Torchmark’s

Military Agency

consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised
of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates. In 2005, life
premium was $199 million or 14% of Torchmark’s total life premium. Premium increased 7% in 2005 from $187 million. Premium also rose 12% in both 2004 and 2003. Annualized premium in force rose 3% in 2005 to $205 million after an increase of 11%
in 2004 and 13% in 2003. Military net sales declined 37% in 2005 to $18 million. These sales rose 4% in 2004. First-year collected premium declined 20% in 2005 to $22 million after an increase in 2004 of 13%. This agency’s sales have been under
pressure as it reorganizes its non-life (non-Torchmark) products. This reorganization included reduced commission rates on non-Torchmark investment products, and resulted in a loss of 30% of this agency’s producing agents appointed with
Torchmark in 2005. Margins in the Military group were negatively affected by hostilities in the Middle East in all three periods, resulting in higher than expected benefits paid of $3.9 million in 2005, $4.0 million in 2004, and $1.1 million in
2003.

Torchmark’s

Other Agencies

consist of the United
Investors Agency, the United American Independent and Branch Office Agencies, and other small miscellaneous sales agencies. The United Investors Agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business. United
Investors represents approximately 5% of Torchmark’s life premium income. The loss of a significant marketing group in 2001 has had a negative impact on production in the United Investors Agency since that time. The United American Independent
and Branch Office Agencies combined represented approximately 4% of Torchmark’s total life premium. Life premium income and sales for these two agencies has declined for the past three years because they focus on health insurance, with life
sales being incidental.

LIFE INSURANCE

Summary of Results

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Gross margins, as indicated by
insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 8% in 2005 to $382 million after rising 9% in 2004. As a percentage of life insurance premium, gross margins have increased slightly each year. Improvements in life
margins have resulted from several factors. The previously-mentioned changes in Liberty’s agent compensation system and premium collection method have contributed to notable increases in Liberty’s margins. Additionally, the percentage of
American Income premium to total premium continues to grow, and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency’s margins are Torchmark’s highest, exceeding 30% in 2005. Direct Response margins have grown to above 25% in 2005,
as it has emphasized sales of its higher-margin juvenile policy.



Health Insurance.

Health products sold by Torchmark insurance companies consist of
supplemental plans that include limited benefit hospital/surgical plans, cancer, and accident plans sold to people under age 65, as well as Medicare Supplements sold to enrollees in the Federal Medicare program. Health premium represented 40% of
Torchmark’s total premium income in 2005, compared with 42% in 2004 and 44% in 2003. Health underwriting margin accounted for 31% of the total, compared with 32% in 2004 and 33% in 2003. These declines in the health percentages indicate the
growth in Torchmark’s life segment in relation to the health segment. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.

HEALTH INSURANCE

Premium by Distribution Method

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Torchmark markets its
supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two United American agencies being the market leaders. Over the past three years, Torchmark has placed greater emphasis on the sale of limited-benefit health
insurance products rather than Medicare Supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited benefit hospital/surgical plans has increased, and price competition and lesser demand for Medicare Supplements has dampened sales of that product. While
Medicare Supplement still remains Torchmark’s dominant health product in terms of premium income, the other limited-benefit health products have been growing rapidly in their contribution to health premium. As shown in the chart above, Medicare
Supplement premium represented 60% of total health premium in 2005, but has declined steadily as a percentage of total health premium in each successive year. Accordingly, limited-benefit health products have increased as a percentage of total
health premium each year during the same period.

The United American Branch
Office and Independent Agencies

.

As discussed above, the two United American Agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limited-benefit health plans known generally as hospital/surgical plans for
which demand has increased in recent years. These plans provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined, a fixed-amount surgical schedule, some out patient coverage, and other miscellaneous hospital-related charges. They also
contain caps on total per-illness benefits. Consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major-medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers. Minimum
regulatory loss ratios on these limited-benefit plans are generally lower than those of Medicare Supplement; however, the Medicare Supplement product has higher persistency rates, resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting
margin as a percentage of premium. Both of the United American agencies offer these limited-benefit plans.

The United American Branch Office is an exclusive agency, meaning the agents in its 99 offices nationwide sell only for the Company. In recent years, this agency
has been successful in building sales of limited-benefit plans to replace the decline in Medicare Supplement sales. Net sales of limited-benefit plans in 2005 were $78 million, a 26% increase. Net sales in 2004 were $62 million, a 41% increase over
2003. As a result, total health sales at the UA Branch Office were $96 million, a 16% increase over 2004, including the decline in Medicare Supplement sales. Premium from limited-benefit plans at the UA Branch Office increased by 33% to $95 million
in 2005 compared with 2004, but total health premium remained



relatively unchanged at $323 million in 2005, due to the slow decline in premium from the in force Medicare Supplement block. Health premium for 2004 increased 2% from
$316 million in 2003. At year end 2005, the UA Branch office had 2,166 producing agents compared with 1,677 at year end 2004, a 29% increase. This agency had 1,510 agents at year end 2003.

The United American Independent Agency is composed of over 27,000 independent agencies
whose size range from very large, multi-state organizations down to one-person offices, all of whom generally sell for a number of insurance companies. In the recent past, most of this agency’s health sales came from one large independent
agency. However, in 2005, the UA Independent Agency’s net health sales dropped by 32% to $59 million, reflecting an earlier disruption in that leading agency’s recruiting and training program that resulted in a decline in producing agents.
While 2005 limited-benefit premium of $98 million at the UA Independent Agency was up 1% compared with 2004, Medicare Supplement premium of $344 million declined 7%. The UA Independent Agency has the largest in force block of Medicare Supplement
policies. Total health premium for 2005 at this agency was $442 million, declining 6% from 2004, while 2004 premium of $468 million was unchanged from 2003.

Liberty National

Exclusive Agency

, predominately a life insurance distribution channel, is the third largest writer of Torchmark health business based
on premium collected. Cancer supplemental plans are the limited-benefit health products primarily produced by this agency and Liberty is the only Torchmark distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product. Approximately
one half of the cancer block consists of a closed block of business which arose from a class-action settlement in the mid-1990s. Prior to 2005, significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on the closed block were a continuing factor
causing growth in health premium, but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins. Early in 2005, Liberty settled a class-action lawsuit that arose over the timing and size of the rate increases on the closed block. The settlement
provides for claims incurred after the effective date of the settlement in early March 2005 to be paid on an actual incurred basis, rather than a billed basis, which management estimates will reduce benefits paid going forward. It also provides for
a grandfathered period for certain claimants that will allow them to be paid at billed rates for one year. The settlement further requires Liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an 85% claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business.
As a result, premiums are estimated to decline from about $70 million per year prior to the settlement to about $50 million in force when the settlement is fully phased in, assuming no lapsed policies. Prior to the settlement, Liberty has had a
claims loss ratio above 100% on this block.

Health premium at Liberty
declined 9% to $149 million in 2005 compared with 2004 because of the reduced premiums on the closed block of cancer business, as described above. 2004 health premium of $164 million remained unchanged from 2003. Net health sales for 2005 increased
5% to $14 million compared with 2004 net health sales of $13 million, which were up 12% compared with 2003.

American Income Exclusive Agency,

also predominately a life insurance distribution channel, is Torchmark’s fourth largest health insurance distributor
based on 2005 premium collected. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans for which almost two thirds of the agency’s 2005 health premium was from accident policies. Sales of the health plans by this agency are generally
made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.

Health premium for 2005 increased 7% over 2004 to $64 million, while 2004 premium of $60 million increased 7% over 2003. Net health sales of $11 million in 2005 declined 6% compared with 2004, but net sales of $12 million increased 1% over
2003. Net health sales comprised only 12% of American Income Agency’s total net sales in 2005.

Direct Response

, primarily a life operation, also produces health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to employer or union
sponsored groups. In 2005, net health sales of $6 million, which comprises only 5% of Direct Response’s total life and health net sales, declined 12% compared with 2004 net health sales of $7 million. The 2004 net health sales had declined 46%
from 2003 net sales of $13 million. Health premium in 2005 was $38 million, a 9% increase compared with $35 million in 2004. The 2004 premium rose 22% over $28 million of premium in 2003.



New

health product offering—Medicare Part D.

In 2005, United American
contracted with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to be an insurer under the government’s new prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Unlike the traditional Medicare program for hospital and doctor services, where CMS
is the primary insurer and private Medicare Supplement insurers like United American are secondary insurers, insurers participating in Part D are the primary insurers for plans regulated by CMS. CMS will pay approximately two thirds of the premium
with the insured Medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium. For 2006, United American will collect monthly premiums averaging $65.00 from CMS and $34.50 from each insured who joins UA’s plan. Sales solicitations were allowed to begin
in October 2005 with the coverage becoming effective January 1, 2006. By January 31, 2006, United American had enrolled 121 thousand insureds into its Part D plan. Enrollment for 2006 coverage can continue until May 15, 2006. Details of the United
American Part D plan can be viewed at www.unitedamericanpartd.com.

margin before other income and administrative expense increased 1% in 2005 from $175 million to $177 million even though there was a 3% decline in premium. In 2004, health underwriting income rose 6% from $164 million in 2003. As a percentage of
premium, underwriting income before other income and administrative expense rose in 2005 to 17.5% and in 2004 to 16.6% from 15.9% in 2003, largely as a result of the reduced loss ratios in the previously-mentioned closed block of cancer business at
Liberty. Liberty’s health margins increased $7 million or 36% in 2005, or 17% of health premium. Liberty’s health margins were 11% of premium in 2004 and 6% in 2003.



Annuities.

Fixed and variable annuity products are sold on a limited basis by
Torchmark subsidiaries. Annuities represented 1% of Torchmark’s 2005 premium revenue and less than 3% of insurance underwriting margin. Torchmark does not emphasize this segment.

ANNUITIES

Summary of
Results

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Annuities generate earnings from
periodic policy fees and charges based on the average account balances, reduced by net policy obligations, less acquisition costs. For fixed annuities, net required interest on reserves is the required interest credited to the accounts and is offset
by investment income.

For all three periods shown in the chart above,
account balances declined, which resulted in reductions in policy fees and charges. Policy obligations also declined in each period. In all three periods, investment income earned exceeded required interest credited to fixed accounts resulting in
negative net required interest on reserves. As a result, insurance underwriting margin for annuities (before other income and administrative expenses) increased 18% from $11.8 million in 2003 to $14.0 million in 2004, but declined 10% to $12.6
million in 2005. Margins were benefited by a decline in guaranteed minimum policy benefits in 2004 to $2.8 million from $5.0 million in 2003, as a result of an increase in equity markets. Equity markets were more stable in 2005.

Administrative expenses.

Torchmark’s operating
expenses, as included in the Other and Corporate Segments, are classified in two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. A reconciliation of “Other operating expenses” per the

Consolidated
Statements of Operations

to operating expenses per the segment analysis is as follows:

As noted in the

in
this discussion, the costs of settling certain significant litigation in 2005 relate to prior periods and are not considered by management to relate to current insurance operations.



Consider the following information for the three years ended December 31, 2005.

Operating Expenses Selected Information

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

*

Revenues include realized gains of $.3 million in 2005 and $22.2 million in 2004, and losses of $3.3 million in 2003. Additionally, revenues in 2005 include a one-time litigation settlement
of $13.5 million and revenues in 2003 also include a nonrecurring nonoperating interest income benefit of $4.3 million related to interest received on a tax settlement. Because realized gains and losses and nonoperating items bear no relationship to
core operations in the view of management, Torchmark removes the effect of these items from revenue when evaluating expense ratios.

Insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium and total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue rose slightly in both 2005 and 2004. The
2005 increase was primarily due to increased employee cost and a $1.3 million payroll tax charge related to the option exercise and restoration program incurred in 2005, which program is discussed under the caption

Capital Resources

in this
report. Litigation expense in 2004 increased $3.7 million, affecting the 2004 increase.

The investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments, debt and cash
flow. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in

Note 1

3—

Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

It is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs.”
Management also views excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares
outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing its share repurchase program in 1986, Torchmark has used over $2.8 billion of cash flow to repurchase
Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been
invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, management believes that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate
measure of the investment segment.

Excess investment income declined 2%
in 2005 to $324 million from $331 million in 2004. It increased 4% in 2004 and 9% in 2003. However, on a per diluted share basis, 2005 excess investment income rose 4% to $3.07. Per share excess investment income increased 7% in 2004 and 14% in
2003. Growth in excess investment income is impacted by increases in investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and changes in rates available in financial markets. It is also affected by crediting rates on policy liabilities and changes
in Torchmark’s borrowing costs. Additionally, share purchases in recent periods have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income.

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 5% to $603 million in 2005. It rose 3% to $577
million in 2004 from $558 million in 2003. Included in 2003 investment income was a nonrecurring interest income item resulting from a tax settlement of $4.3 million pretax. Management excludes nonrecurring items when it views investment income.
After excluding this item, investment income rose 4% in 2004. As presented in the following chart, the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets.

The lower growth in income is reflective of new
investments made each year at long-term yields lower than the portfolio’s average yield, resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in recent years. Also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls
on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio, as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities. Given the sizeable annual cash flow from Torchmark’s operations, management expects mean invested assets to
continue to grow, but as long as the current low-interest rate environment continues, the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure. More detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption.



Excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid
on corporate debt. Information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table.

Interest Credited to Net Insurance Policy Liabilities

(Dollar amounts in millions)

Excess investment income was
positively affected by reduced crediting rates on certain policy liabilities in 2003 and 2004. In those years, the growth in interest credited to policy liabilities was not as great as the growth in the liabilities, as the Company was able to
respond to the low-interest environment with reduced crediting rates on fixed annuities and certain life products. While annuity crediting rates were reduced in 2005, the Company was not able to further reduce life and health crediting rates. For
more information on life and health crediting rates, please refer to

Note 5—Future Policy Benefit Reserves

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.



Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily
consist of interest on Torchmark’s various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below reconciles interest expense per the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

to financing costs.

The table below presents the components of financing costs.

Analysis of Financing Costs

(Amounts in thousands)

Financing costs rose 62% or $20
million in 2005. They increased 11% or $3 million in 2004. Both the 2005 and 2004 increases primarily resulted from the expiration in September 2004 of a profitable interest-rate swap, on which Torchmark had earned over $3 million per quarter during
the first three quarters of 2004 and the full year 2003. The interest-rate swaps are agreements between Torchmark and certain banks for which Torchmark receives from the banks fixed-rate payments that match the coupons that it pays to its debt
holders, and makes floating-rate payments based on LIBOR rates to the banks. While new swaps were entered into in August of 2004, the spreads on the new swaps were not as great as the expired swap, and accounted for more than a $2 million reduction
in swap benefit per quarter when compared against the expired swap. These new swaps were sold in September, 2005 because of a change in management’s outlook for short-term rates. During the thirteen-month period the swaps were held, Torchmark
earned approximately $3.7 million in reduced interest cost. Also affecting financing costs in the latter part of 2004 and the full year 2005 were rising short-term rates. These rising rates reduced the positive effect of Torchmark’s other swaps
and increased short-term borrowing costs. A full description of these swaps is disclosed in

Note 1

Debt

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Torchmark’s investment strategy is to maintain a positive spread between the yield on investments and the yield on the
interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt. It is this positive spread that results in excess investment income. At the same time, Torchmark desires to invest predominately in investment-grade corporate fixed maturities. In prolonged periods of
low long-term interest rates, maintaining sufficient spread while limiting new investments to high quality securities becomes more challenging. Torchmark addressed this issue of low long-term rates prior to 2005 by lengthening the maturities of new
investment purchases to maximize the yield, and by revising the crediting rates downward on various products. Even though yields on new long-term investments declined, there was still a significant spread of long-term yields over short-term yields.



However, the lower long-term interest rates combined with rising short-term rates experienced in late 2004 and 2005
have restricted the growth of excess investment income. As the yield curve flattened, with rising short-term rates but with no meaningful change in long-term rates, compensation for investing long-term has been significantly diminished. Therefore,
in mid-2005, Torchmark revised its investment strategy to shorten the maturity of most new investments, while maintaining its policy to acquire only investment grade securities. The Company believes that investing in shorter-term maturities is the
best strategy because the reduced spreads between long and short maturities are not enough to justify investing solely in long-term bonds. The lower yields could result in reduced excess investment income spreads over the short-term.

In the event of an increase in long-term rates, excess investment income will benefit
as new acquisitions can be made at higher yields. While higher short-term rates will increase floating-rate financing costs, higher long-term rates would be to Torchmark’s advantage because the amount of cash invested annually significantly
exceeds the amount of floating rate debt, and would result in greater investment income net of financing costs under most yield curve scenarios. At any rate, excess investment income has grown significantly in each of the four years prior to 2005
and has exceeded fifty percent of net investment income in every year since 2000.

Acquisitions

.    The chart below presents selected information about Torchmark’s fixed-maturity acquisitions in the years 2003 through 2005. Investment-grade corporate securities include both bonds and
trust-preferred securities (classified as redeemable preferred stocks) with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors. Both yield and average life calculations on new purchases on noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date. In the case of
callable bonds, the average life is based on the call date or maturity date, whichever produces the lowest yield (“yield to worst”).

Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information

(Dollar
amounts in millions)

Torchmark continues to invest
exclusively in investment-grade bonds. As previously discussed, Torchmark attempted to maximize yield on new investments in the low-interest environment in 2003, 2004, and early 2005 by lengthening maturities. As a result, the average life of new
fixed maturity acquisitions was 23.4 years in 2004 and 23.1 years in 2003, and the effective annual yield on new investments was 6.47% in 2004 and 6.55% in 2003. In 2005, however, as Torchmark’s investment strategy changed, the effective annual
yield on new investments declined to 5.90% and the average life fell to 15.3 years. Management believes that because of the long-term, fixed-rate characteristics of its policy liabilities, the Company does not have to strictly match assets and
liabilities.

New cash flow available to Torchmark for investment has
been greatly affected by issuer calls as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past few years. Issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they can refinance them at a lower cost. Calls increase funds
available for investment, but they negatively affect portfolio yield, as they cause Torchmark to replace higher-yielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields. Calls increased during 2003 and 2004 but declined somewhat in 2005.
Issuer calls were $226 million in 2005, $352 million in 2004, and $457 million in 2003. As long as the yields on new fixed maturity acquisitions remain below the overall portfolio yield, the portfolio yield will slowly decline as will investment
income and excess investment income. As discussed above, however, because of the sizeable annual cash flow generated from operations, management believes the Company will be well positioned when investment interest rates eventually rebound.



Portfolio Analysis.

Torchmark’s emphasis has been on bond investments over
alternative investments. Therefore, the relative percentage of Torchmark’s investments by type varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of
December 31, 2005 with the latest industry data.

Additional information
concerning the fixed-maturity portfolio is as follows.

Fixed Maturity
Portfolio Selected Information

*

A measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed-income security to a particular change in interest rates.

Torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixed-maturity portfolio two ways: (1) based on the same date used to
calculate the yield, which is the call date producing the lowest yield (“worst call” date) for callable bonds and the maturity date for all other bonds, and (2) based on the maturity date of all bonds, whether callable or not.

At the end of 2005 and 2004, the fixed-maturity portfolio had a gross unrealized
gain of $486 million and $670 million, respectively. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were $61 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $21 million a year earlier. Please see

Note 3—Investments

in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

for an analysis of unrealized investment losses.



Credit Risk Sensitivity.

Credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain
its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. In weak economic periods, the securities of industry sectors affected by the economic downturn suffer increased credit risk. As a result, securities in these weakened sectors could be
downgraded by credit-rating agencies to below-investment grade status. Thus, the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities’ terms is reduced and the securities’ market values can be negatively impacted. As Torchmark continues to
invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, credit risk is a concern. Torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring investment-grade bonds, and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer.
Torchmark continues to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2005, approximately 94% of invested assets at fair value were held in fixed-maturity securities. The major rating agencies considered 92% of this portfolio to
be investment grade. The average quality rating of the portfolio continues to be BBB+. The table below demonstrates the credit rankings of Torchmark’s fixed-maturity portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2005.

Torchmark’s current
investment policy is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.

Torchmark additionally reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors. The following table
presents the industry sectors that exceeded 2% of the corporate fixed-maturity portfolio at fair value at December 31, 2005.

Otherwise, no individual
industry represented 2% or more of Torchmark’s corporate fixed maturities.

Market Risk Sensitivity.

The primary market risk to which Torchmark’s financial securities are exposed is interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current
fair value of the company’s investment portfolio. Since Torchmark’s portfolio is comprised 94% of fixed-maturity investments, it is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates in recent years have generally resulted in
the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the



portfolio. However, Torchmark does not expect to realize these unrealized gains because it is generally the Company’s investment strategy to hold these
investments to maturity. The Company’s strategy would be the same should markets reverse and market rates increase placing the fixed-income portfolio in an unrealized loss position. The long-term nature of Torchmark’s insurance policy
liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to declines in market interest rates largely
offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, in accordance with GAAP, these liabilities are not marked to market.

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of Torchmark’s interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2005 and 2004. This
table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of Torchmark’s fixed-maturity portfolio. The data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and
estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points. It takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options, put options, and
unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio, given the changes in rates. The valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance.

Realized Gains and
Losses.

As a group of life and health insurance carriers, Torchmark collects premium income from its policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future.
In addition to the payment of these benefits, Torchmark also incurs acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of its insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess
of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, Torchmark, as a part of its core insurance operations, holds a significant investment portfolio. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities
containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are
taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.

Because Torchmark holds this large and diverse investment portfolio, investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains
and losses occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. Torchmark does not engage in
trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which are beyond the control of management are only secondary to Torchmark’s core insurance operations of providing insurance
coverage to policyholders. Unlike investment income, they are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of Torchmark’s insurance products.

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, however, and as a result,
have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future
trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as management



views its operations. For these reasons, Torchmark management removes the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating its overall insurance operating results.

The following table summarizes Torchmark’s tax-effected realized
gains (losses) by component for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005.

Analysis of After-tax Realized Gains (Losses)

(Amounts in thousands, except for per share data)

*

The reduction in interest cost from swapping fixed-rate obligations to floating rate.

In both 2004 and 2003, Torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired
securities met some or all of Torchmark’s criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as discussed in

Note 3

—

Investments

in the

Notes to Consolidated

Financial Statements

and in its

Critical Accounting
Policies

in this report. Pretax charges for these impairments were $6 million in 2004 and $15 million in 2003. Regarding all bonds previously written down, the bonds of 3 issuers were still held at December 31, 2005 at a fair value of $46.0
million and a recorded book value of $29.5 million.

Accounting rules
require Torchmark to value its interest-rate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period. The fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their
value will be zero when they ultimately expire. These period-to-period fluctuations can be substantial. However, Torchmark management does not consider these period-to-period fluctuations in value in managing its ongoing operations because their
cumulative result will be zero if held to expiration. These temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of “Realized Investment Gains (Losses)” in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

. This fair
value adjustment for all swaps on an after-tax basis was a negative $5 million in 2005 and 2004, compared with a negative $10 million in 2003.

Torchmark has historically held its swaps to maturity. However, in the third quarter of 2005, two swaps were sold because of an expectation of higher short-term
rates in the future. The swaps sold were the $99 million notional amount related to the 8.25% Senior Debentures and the $100 million notional amount associated with the 7.375% Notes. Proceeds of $239 thousand were received on the sales.

The Securities and Exchange Commission’s accounting guidance currently requires
that all income and expenses related to a nonhedged derivative be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded. Therefore, Torchmark combines the cash settlements on nonhedged swaps with the
noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses. Additionally, Torchmark includes the cash settlements on its hedged swap derivatives in realized investment gains and losses for consistency.
Torchmark’s pretax interest cost reduction from these cash settlements included in realized investment gains was a positive $7 million in 2005, a positive $23 million in 2004, and a positive $26 million in 2003. Torchmark continues to reduce
interest cost for this benefit in its segment analysis, because the segment analysis is required by GAAP to be as management evaluates the performance of the segment. Torchmark views the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in its
financing costs in its investment segment.



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity.

Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations
and financial obligations. Torchmark’s liquidity is derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.

Torchmark’s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows
in excess of its immediate needs. Sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes.

Operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life
insurers, such as Torchmark, expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods, sometimes many years later. A liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force
grows so that Torchmark can “save” for these future payments. Earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period, but there is no corresponding cash outlay. Therefore, cash provided from operations is generally expected to
significantly exceed net income in any given period. Cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of Torchmark’s investment portfolio. Cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future
requirements. Available cash flows are also used to repay debt, to buy back Torchmark shares, to pay shareholder dividends, and for other corporate uses. While Torchmark’s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong, a material
reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity.

Cash flows
provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended December 31, 2005 over their respective prior year. They were $857 million in 2005, $767 million in 2004, and $740 million in 2003. In addition, Torchmark received $473 million in
investment maturities, repayments, and calls in 2005, adding to available cash flows. Such repayments were $574 million in 2004 and $682 million in 2003.

Torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. For a
detailed discussion of this line of credit facility, see the commercial paper section of

Note 10

—

Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Torchmark’s cash and short-term investments were $138 million at year-end 2005 and $99 million at year-end 2004. Additionally,
Torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $8.9 billion at December 31, 2005. However, Torchmark’s strong cash flows
from operations, investment maturities, and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.

Liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends. The parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet
dividend payments on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayment requirements on parent-company debt, and operating expenses of the parent company. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by
subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of

Note 11

—

Shareholders’ Equity

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has
substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations.

it owns all of the entity’s voting equity. While these liabilities are not on Torchmark’s balance sheet, they are represented by Torchmark’s 7

Torchmark has guaranteed the performance of the Capital Trusts to meet its financial obligations to the Trust Preferred shareholders.

Pension obligations to Torchmark’s employees are obligations of trust fund
entities which are not reflected on Torchmark’s balance sheet. The obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans. These trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by
Torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due.

During 2005, Torchmark subsidiary American Income entered into an agreement to guarantee certain personal loans of American Income employees and agents with First
Command Bank. First Command Bank is a subsidiary of First Command Financial Services, Inc. (First Command) of which Lamar C. Smith is Chairman and CEO. He is also a director of Torchmark. At December 31, 2005, the balance subject to this guarantee
was $182 thousand. These guarantees are secured by vested commissions due the employees and agents. See

(1)

Interest on debt is based on Torchmark’s fixed contractual obligations. As certain debt instruments have related swaps which exchange fixed obligations to those based on floating rates,
Torchmark’s actual interest cost may be greater or lesser than presented. At December 31, 2005, Torchmark had in place swaps with a notional amount of $330 million on its $692 million of long-term debt at par value. More information about
Torchmark’s swaps is found in

Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at December 31, 2005. These estimated
payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the
liability of $8.6 billion at December 31, 2005, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.



Capital Resources.

Torchmark’s capital structure consists of short-term debt
(the commercial paper facility described in

Note 10

—

Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements),

long-term funded debt, Junior Subordinated Debentures supporting its trust preferred securities, and
shareholders’ equity. The Junior Subordinated Debentures are payable to Torchmark’s Capital Trusts which are liable for its Trust Preferred Securities. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are included in “Due to
affiliates” on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in

Note 10—Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The carrying value of the funded debt was $688 million at December 31, 2005, compared
with $695 million a year earlier. In connection with these instruments, Torchmark had in place two interest-rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005, but also had two swap agreements that were sold in September, 2005 and another swap agreement
which expired in September, 2004. All of these agreements were entered into to exchange Torchmark’s fixed-rate obligations on the debt instruments to floating rates. Information about these swaps is also found in

Note 10

.

The carrying value of Torchmark’s 6

% Senior Notes

is adjusted each period to reflect
the change in fair value of a swap instrument which hedges the value of the note. This swap increased the value of long-term debt by $.3 million and $5.7 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Additionally, Torchmark
entered into a swap agreement on its 8


/


% Senior Debentures in August, 2004 which qualified as a fair-value hedge on that
security. That swap was disposed of in September, 2005. It increased the value of long-term debt by $2.4 million at December 31, 2004.

Torchmark maintains a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support its insurance policyholders’ liabilities. Torchmark is required by an
accounting rule (SFAS 115) to revalue this portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected
directly in shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets. While SFAS 115 requires invested assets to be revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing
insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner. Due to the size of Torchmark’s policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders’ equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in
the reported value of shareholders’ equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period
presentation of Torchmark’s shareholders’ equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. For this reason, Torchmark’s
management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of SFAS 115 when analyzing Torchmark’s balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.



The following tables present selected data related to Torchmark’s capital resources. Additionally, the tables
present the effect of SFAS 115 on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmark’s capital structure.

Torchmark’s debt covenants require that the effect of SFAS 115 be removed to determine this ratio

Torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 13.0 times in 2005,
compared with 13.8 times in 2004, and 12.6 times in 2003. A discussion of Torchmark’s interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption

Investments

in this report.

In the second quarter of 2005, Torchmark executed a voluntary stock option exercise and
restoration program in which 120 directors, employees and consultants exercised vested options of the Company’s common stock and received a lesser number of new options at the current market price. As a result, the Company issued 5.8 million
new shares to the participants. However, a substantial number of the new shares were immediately sold through the open market by the participants to cover the option exercise price of their new shares and their related income taxes. As a result of
the program, management’s ownership in Torchmark increased and the Company received a significant tax benefit from the exercise of the options. Torchmark received $213 million in proceeds for the exercise price and $37 million in tax benefits,
both of which added to shareholder’s equity. However, as previously mentioned, Torchmark generally uses the proceeds of option exercises to repurchase shares on the open market to reduce the dilution caused by option exercises. As a result, the
total impact on shareholder’s equity and cash flow from the transaction was immaterial. More information on stock options and this program is found in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

and in

Note 12—Stock Options

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As previously
mentioned, Torchmark’s Board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the Company’s stock repurchase program in July, 2005 in amounts and timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determined to be in the best interest of the
Company. Torchmark has repurchased its common stock every year since 1986, except for 1995, the year following the acquisition of American Income. Since the beginning of 1998, Torchmark has repurchased 40 million shares at a total cost of $1.6
billion, and has acquired no fewer than 3.4 million shares in any one year. Management believes that Torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings, return on equity, and are an excellent way to increase total
shareholder value. As noted earlier in this report, Torchmark acquired 5.6 million shares at a cost of $300 million in 2005 with excess cash flow. If the $300 million free cash flow used for the repurchase of Torchmark common stock had alternatively
been invested in corporate bonds, an estimated $9 million of additional investment income, after tax, would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased 10% to $4.59. Because share purchases were made, actual net income per
share was $4.68, an increase of 12%. Torchmark intends to continue the repurchase of its common shares when financial markets are favorable.



Credit Ratings.

The credit quality of Torchmark’s debt instruments and capital
securities are rated by various rating agencies. During 2003, Standard and Poor’s upgraded Torchmark’s funded debt rating from A to A+ and its preferred securities rating from BBB+ to A-. The chart below presents Torchmark’s credit
ratings as of December 31, 2005.

The financial strength of
Torchmark’s major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by Standard & Poor’s and A.M. Best. Standard and Poor’s lowered the insurance financial strength rating of United Investors to A+ from AA, noting that United Investors was no
longer a strategic subsidiary to Torchmark. Also during 2003, A. M. Best upgraded American Income’s insurance financial strength rating to A+ (Superior) from A (Excellent). The following chart presents these ratings for Torchmark’s five
largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2005.

A.M. Best states that it assigns
A+ (Superior) ratings to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+ (Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their
obligations to policyholders over a long period of time.

The AA rating
is assigned by Standard & Poor’s Corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. The A+ rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial
security characteristics, somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings. The “+” indicates that United Investors is among the strongest insurers within the A category.

OTHER ITEMS

Litigation.

Torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at
Liberty in Alabama. Such punitive damage claims are tried in Alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in Alabama are based upon the compensatory damages
(including mental anguish) awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined. Additionally, it should be noted that Torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the State of Mississippi, a
jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts. Bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case.
It is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of Torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation. Based upon information



presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and
pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to

NEW UNADOPTED ACCOUNTING RULES

Stock Option Expensing:

Stock options have been granted
to executives, employees, consultants, and directors as a form of compensation to provide motivation and to align the interests of these groups with the same interests of shareholders. Because they are generally granted at the fair value of
Torchmark stock at the date of grant, the value of these options increases as the value of Torchmark stock increases. The cost of these options to the Company is in the dilution caused by the assumed exercise of the options, as the grantees’
ownership of the Company grows in relation to that of existing shareholders. This dilution cost has historically been reflected in per share earnings in the financial statements under the “intrinsic value” method currently permitted by
GAAP and used by Torchmark. Under this method, a value is assigned to an option only if the exercise price is less than the fair value of the stock at the date of grant. Because Torchmark’s options are generally granted at an exercise price
equal to the fair value of Torchmark stock, Torchmark has historically incurred no option expense.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued

Statement 123R

,

Share-Based Payment

, originally effective for Torchmark as of
July 1, 2005 but later deferred by the Securities and Exchange Commission to January 1, 2006. The provisions of this Statement will require Torchmark to record an expense in the financial statements for stock options based on the “fair
value” method, whereby a value is assigned to each option granted and to recognize an expense as this value is amortized over the period that the option vests. This expense will be deducted from earnings and earnings per share in addition to
the option cost already being reflected in the dilution computation described above.

GAAP rules currently require Torchmark to disclose in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

the impact on earnings on a pro forma basis as if the “fair value” method were in effect. Please refer to

Note 1

for more details on the impact of adoption of this revised statement. As explained in

Note 1

, the Company does not expect the adoption of this Statement to materially alter its methodology of computing option expense or that
future results will vary significantly from the pro forma results disclosed for prior periods. At the present time, Torchmark does not plan to change its policies of stock option compensation because of the adoption of this revised statement.

While restatement of prior periods is permitted, the Statement also
permits a “modified prospective” method of adoption, whereby the expense of all unvested options as of January 1, 2006 and options granted after January 1, 2006 are expensed in accordance with the Statement after that date. Torchmark will
elect the modified prospective method of adoption.

The “fair
value” assigned to option grants is derived from complex option pricing models using subjective assumptions such as price volatility and expected term. Considerable judgment is sometimes involved in the determination of these assumptions, which
must be made at the time of option grant. Variations in actual experience versus the assumptions can cause material differences in an option’s actual value when it is ultimately exercised versus its expense recorded in the financial statements.
However, while a variety of pricing models are acceptable under the Statement, Torchmark plans to use the Black-Scholes pricing model used for the pro forma disclosures, with assumptions most reflective of Torchmark’s experience. Statement 123R
does not permit the recorded expense to be adjusted to reflect actual experience.

Earnings per Share:

As described in

Note 1

—

Significant Accounting Policies,

diluted earnings per share include the dilution resulting from the potential conversion of dilutive securities such as stock options into
Torchmark common stock. The potential dilution from stock options has traditionally been calculated using the “treasury stock method” required by GAAP. This method assumes that Torchmark uses the funds derived from the assumed exercise of
options to buy treasury stock, thus reducing the net number of new shares outstanding resulting from the exercise.



The issuance by the FASB of Statement 123R, requiring the expensing of stock options, revises the method of
computing dilutive shares. The revised method does not allow the traditional treasury stock method which simulates cash flow, but instead limits cash receipts from the tax benefit and injects a hypothetical concept known as “unrecognized option
expense” to the dilution model. As a result, diluted shares outstanding under the new Standard will bear no relationship to diluted shares outstanding under the historical model or to a pattern that the Company could actually replicate with its
cash flow as before. Management does not believe that these modifications to the treasury stock method will materially impact earnings per share.

Impairments of Investments:

The FASB issued

FASB Staff Position FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments,”

effective for Torchmark January 1, 2006. This statement clarifies certain previously unresolved issues regarding accounting for investment impairments. No significant impact is expected from adoption.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Future Policy Benefits.

Because of the long-term nature
of insurance contracts, Torchmark’s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance
industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in

Note 1

—

Significant

Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

While management and company actuaries
have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents Torchmark’s
ultimate obligation. Additionally, because of the size of this liability, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts. A list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future
policy benefits is reported in

Note 5

—

Future Policy Benefit Reserves

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased.

The costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded
as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales. Additionally, the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other
companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “Value of Insurance Purchased.” Torchmark’s policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in

Note 1

—

Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization.
For more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see

Note 4

—

Deferred

Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable.

This liability
consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all
information available to the Company. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation, the litigation environment,
regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. Torchmark management
believes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated
liability will be Torchmark’s ultimate obligation.

Revenue
Recognition.

Premium income for Torchmark’s subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected. However, in accordance with GAAP, revenue on limited-payment contracts and
universal life-type contracts (deposit balance products) are recognized differently. Revenues on limited-payment contracts are recognized over the contract period. Premium for



deposit balance products, such as Torchmark’s annuity and interest-sensitive life policies, is added to the policy account value. The policy account value (or
deposit balance) is a Torchmark liability. This deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance, administration, surrender, and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the
policyholder. In each case, benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned.

Investment income is reported as revenue by Torchmark when it is earned, less investment expenses. The investment activities of Torchmark are integral to its
insurance operations. Because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested. Anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected
in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on Torchmark’s net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and
contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to

in this report.

Impairment of Investments.

Torchmark continually monitors
its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value. While the values of the investments in Torchmark’s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has
experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary. The policies and procedures that Torchmark uses to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in

Policies

Financial Statements

and the discussions under the captions

Investments

and

Realized Gains and

Losses

in this report.

While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value
with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.

Defined benefit pension plans.

Torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time
employees. It also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Torchmark’s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP,
an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are partially offset by the growth in value of the
assets in the funded plans.

The actuarial assumptions used in
determining Torchmark’s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These
assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in Torchmark’s pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a
decrease in this obligation. These assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results. While management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable
assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected. The assumptions are reviewed annually and
revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to the Company. Torchmark’s discount rate, rate of return on assets, and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

Torchmark cautions readers regarding certain forward-looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this
document, and in any other statements made by, or on behalf of Torchmark whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any statement that is not a historical fact, or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or
projection concerning Torchmark or its business, whether express or implied, is meant as and should be considered a forward-looking statement. Such statements represent management’s opinions concerning future operations, strategies, financial
results or other developments.

Forward-looking statements are based upon
estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond Torchmark’s control. If these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, the actual results of Torchmark
may differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events
or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to Torchmark specifically. Such events or developments could include, but are not necessarily limited to:

1) Changes in lapse rates and/or sales of Torchmark’s policies as
well as levels of mortality, morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from Torchmark’s assumptions;

2) Federal and state legislative and regulatory developments, particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal Medicare program that
would affect Medicare Supplement insurance;

3) Market
trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans, and that could affect the sales of traditional Medicare
Supplement insurance;

4) Interest rate changes that
affect product sales and/or investment portfolio yield;

5) General economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers’ financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities owned by Torchmark, or that may impair issuers ability to pay interest due Torchmark on those
securities;

6) Changes in pricing competition;

7) Litigation results;

8) Levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ
from Torchmark’s assumptions;

9) The inability of
Torchmark to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay;

10) The customer response to new products and marketing initiatives; and

11) Reported amounts in the financial statements which are based on management’s estimates and judgments which
may differ from the actual amounts ultimately realized.

Readers are also directed to
consider other risks and uncertainties described in other documents filed by Torchmark with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Torchmark Corporation

Birmingham,
Alabama

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries (“Torchmark”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of Torchmark’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar amounts in millions except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

Business:

Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark) through its subsidiaries provides a variety of life and health insurance products and annuities to a broad base of customers.

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the results of Torchmark and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its previously issued

FASB Interpretation 46 (FIN46R)

to clarify the definition of
a variable interest and the instructions for consolidating variable interest entities (VIE’s). Primary beneficiaries only are required to consolidate VIE’s. Therefore, a company may have voting control of a VIE, but if it is not the
primary beneficiary of the VIE in accordance with FIN46R, it is not permitted to consolidate the VIE. The trusts that are liable for Torchmark’s Trust Preferred Securities meet the definition of VIE’s. However, Torchmark is not the primary
beneficiary because its interest is not variable. Therefore, Torchmark is not permitted to consolidate its interest in these trusts, even though it owns 100% of the voting equity of the Trusts. For this reason, Torchmark reports its 7


/


% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the Trusts as “Due to Affiliates” each period at its carrying value of $155
million.

Investments:

Torchmark classifies all of its
fixed-maturity investments, which include bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, as available for sale. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected
directly in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in equity securities, which include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Mortgage loans, included in “Other long-term investments,” are carried at amortized cost. Investments in real estate, included in “Other
long-term investments,” are reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight line method. Short-term investments include investments in certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing time
deposits with original maturities within twelve months.

Gains and losses
realized on the disposition of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. Realized investment gains and losses and investment income attributable to separate accounts are credited to the separate accounts and have no effect on
Torchmark’s net income. Investment income attributable to all other insurance policies and products is included in Torchmark’s net investment income. Net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, included
$393 million, $370 million, and $351 million, respectively, which was allocable to policyholder reserves or accounts. Realized investment gains and losses are not allocated to insurance policyholders’ liabilities.

Impairment of Investments:

In March, 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
reached a consensus concerning

Issue 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

(EITF 03-1). It calls for evaluation of all of Torchmark’s fixed-maturity and equity investments
for other-than-temporary impairment each reporting period using a three-step approach. First, evaluate if the investment is impaired (fair value is less than cost or amortized cost). Second, determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary.
While specific procedures are outlined, this step requires



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

considerable evidence-based judgment as to the ultimate recoverability of amounts due, taking into account the severity and duration of the impairment. An assessment
of the ability and intent to hold the security to recovery is also a factor. In the event there is an other-than-temporary impairment, the third step involves a writedown of the cost basis of the security to fair value, which becomes the new cost
basis. EITF 03-1 also calls for certain disclosures.

This new accounting
rule was to be effective for Torchmark beginning July 1, 2004. However, in the third quarter of 2004, the FASB deferred the effective date of certain portions of this rule until it could be further considered. The portions deferred relate to steps
two and three in the impairment analysis above. In November, 2005, the FASB released

FASB Staff Position 115-1 and 124-1

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,”

providing
further guidance on the impairment issues. This document is effective for Torchmark as of January 1, 2006. It essentially retains the three-step model of EITF 03-1, replacing only the step two procedures with guidance previously in effect before
EITF 03-1 was issued. This guidance was historically utilized by Torchmark in evaluating other-than-temporary impairment. The disclosures called for by EITF 03-1 were maintained, and appear in

Note 3

—

Investments.

At the
present time, Torchmark evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment as described in Note 3. If a security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and is treated
as a realized loss. Historically, investment income on other-than-temporarily impaired investments which is past due has not been recorded until received. Under the new FSP, the written-down security will be amortized and revenue recognized in
accordance with estimated future cash flows.

Derivatives

:

Torchmark accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

as amended. All of Torchmark’s derivatives, which
consist of interest-rate swaps, are carried at fair market value in the consolidated financial statements. Fluctuations in these values adjust realized investment gains and losses. If a derivative qualifies as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133,
gains and losses in the derivative are substantially offset by changes in the underlying hedged instrument.

During 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission made known interpretative guidance concerning SFAS 133. They have concluded that all income and expenses related
to a nonhedged derivative must be recorded in the same line item that the adjustment to fair value is recorded. In order to comply with this interpretation, Torchmark no longer reduces its interest expense on the

Statements of Operations

for
the reduction in interest cost for swapping its fixed rate for a variable rate on nonhedged derivatives. Instead, this benefit from cash settlements is reported as a component of realized investment gains (losses), the same line where the required
fair value adjustment for nonhedged derivatives is reported. Torchmark has also reported the interest cost benefit on hedged derivatives as a component of realized gains (losses), in order to report these items on a consistent basis. In its segment
disclosure, however, Torchmark continues to report the interest cost benefit from the swaps as a reduction in interest expense, as GAAP requires this disclosure to be presented as management views its business.

Determination of Fair Values of Financial Instruments:

Fair value for cash,
short-term investments, short-term debt, receivables and payables approximates carrying value. Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. Otherwise, fair values are based on quoted market prices of
comparable instruments. Mortgages are valued using discounted cash flows. Substantially all of Torchmark’s long-term debt, along with the trust preferred securities, is valued based on quoted market prices. Interest-rate swaps are valued using
discounted anticipated cash flows.

Cash:

Cash consists of
balances on hand and on deposit in banks and financial institutions. Overdrafts arising from the overnight investment of funds offset cash balances on hand and on deposit.

Securities Lending:

Torchmark has entered into a securities lending agreement whereby certain securities from its portfolio are
loaned to other institutions. Cash collateral obtained from the borrower, equal to 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest, is deposited with a lending agent and invested by that agent in accordance with the
Company’s guidelines to generate

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

additional income. Torchmark shares this income with the lending agent. Torchmark maintains full ownership rights to the securities loaned and continues to earn
interest on them. Accordingly, the loaned securities are included in invested assets. The securities lending collateral is recognized as an asset with a corresponding liability for the obligations to return the collateral.

Recognition of Premium Revenue and Related Expenses:

Premiums for insurance
contracts which are not defined as universal life-type according to SFAS 97 are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying period of the policy. Profits for limited-payment life insurance contracts as defined by SFAS 97 are recognized over the
contract period. Premiums for universal life-type and annuity contracts are added to the policy account value, and revenues for such products are recognized as charges to the policy account value for mortality, administration, and surrenders
(retrospective deposit method). Variable life and annuity products are also assessed an investment management fee and a sales charge. Life premium includes policy charges of $57.6 million, $60.9 million, and $64.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Other premium includes annuity policy charges for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, of $24.5 million, $27.5 million, and $31.2 million, respectively. Profits are also earned
to the extent that investment income exceeds policy liability interest requirements. The related benefits and expenses are matched with revenues by means of the provision of future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs
in a manner which recognizes profits as they are earned over the same period.

Future Policy Benefits:

The liability for future policy benefits for universal life-type products according to SFAS 97 is represented by policy account value. The liability for future policy benefits for all other life and health
products is provided on the net level premium method based on estimated investment yields, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other assumptions which were considered appropriate at the time the policies were issued. Assumptions used are based on
Torchmark’s previous experience with similar products. For the majority of Torchmark’s insurance products, the assumptions used were those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies were issued. Once established, assumptions are
generally not changed. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed. These estimates are periodically reviewed and compared with actual experience. If it is determined future
experience will probably differ significantly from that previously assumed, the estimates are revised. Additionally, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts.

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased:

The costs of
acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales. Additionally, deferred acquisition costs include the value
of insurance purchased, which are the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies. Deferred acquisition costs and the value of insurance purchased are amortized in a systematic manner
which matches these costs with the associated revenues. Policies other than universal life-type policies are amortized with interest over the estimated premium-paying period of the policies in a manner which charges each year’s operations in
proportion to the receipt of premium income. Limited-payment contracts are amortized over the contract period. Universal life-type policies are amortized with interest in proportion to estimated gross profits. The assumptions used to amortize
acquisition costs with regard to interest, mortality, morbidity, and persistency are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits. For interest-sensitive and deposit-balance type products, these assumptions are
reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations. Deferred acquisition costs are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing. These tests ensure that the present
value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized deferred acquisition cost asset. These cash flows consist primarily of premium income, less benefits and expenses taking inflation into account. The present value of these cash
flows, less the benefit reserve, is then compared with the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance. In the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less, this deficiency would be charged to expense as a component of amortization
and the asset balance is reduced by a like amount. Different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization.

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable:

Torchmark establishes a liability for known policy benefits
payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience. Torchmark makes an estimate after careful evaluation of all information available to the
company. However, there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, will be Torchmark’s ultimate obligation.

Separate Accounts:

Separate accounts have been established in connection with Torchmark’s variable life and annuity
businesses. The investments held for the benefit of contractholders (stated at fair value) are reported as “Separate account assets” and the corresponding deposit balance liabilities are reported as “Separate account
liabilities.” The separate account investment portfolios and liabilities are segregated from Torchmark’s other assets and liabilities and these assets are invested in mutual funds of various unaffiliated mutual fund providers. Deposit
collections, investment income, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on separate accounts accrue directly to the contractholders. Therefore, these items are added to the separate account balance and are not reflected in income. Fees are
charged to the deposit balance for insurance risk, administration, and surrender. There is also a sales charge and an investment management fee. These fees and charges are included in premium revenues.

Guaranteed Minimum Policy Benefits:

Torchmark’s variable annuity contracts
generally provide contractual guarantees in the event of death of the contract holder to at least provide the return of the total deposits made to the contract, net of withdrawals. Under certain conditions, they also provide that the benefit will
not be less than the highest contract value on certain specified anniversaries, adjusted for additional deposits and withdrawals after those anniversaries. Torchmark does not offer other types of guaranteed minimum policy benefits, such as minimum
accumulation or income benefits.

In 2003, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued

Statement of Position 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts (SOP 03-1),

which was adopted by Torchmark on
January 1, 2004. This Statement covers various aspects of accounting for nontraditional product features in order to increase uniformity in practice. The primary issue in the Statement affecting Torchmark is the accounting for liabilities for
certain guaranteed minimum policy benefits on Torchmark’s variable annuities. Upon adoption, Torchmark established a liability for these guaranteed minimum policy benefits in the amount of $8.2 million and wrote down deferred acquisition costs
in the amount of $2.8 million. As a result, Torchmark recorded a charge in the amount of $11.0 million before tax ($7.1 million after tax) to reflect the guaranteed benefits. This charge was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in 2004.

Subsequent to adoption, the liability for these
minimum guarantees is determined each period end by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance using actuarial methods and assumptions including mortality, lapses, and interest. This excess benefit is
then recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used. If actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised, Torchmark adjusts
the additional liability balance with a related charge or credit to benefit expense. At December 31, 2005, this liability was $3.5 million and at December 31, 2004 was $3.8 million.

Income Taxes:

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement book values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment, included in “Other assets,” is reported at
cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is recorded primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets which range from two to ten years for equipment and five to forty years for buildings and
improvements. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Impairments, if any, are accounted for in accordance with

SFAS 144, Accounting for the

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

Original cost of
property and equipment was $111 million and $109 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accumulated depreciation was $83 million and $79 million, respectively, at those same dates. Depreciation expense was $4.8 million in 2005, $4.1
million in 2004, and $4.1 million in 2003.

Low-Income Housing Tax
Credit Interests:

As of December 31, 2005, Torchmark has invested approximately $122 million in flow-through entities that provide low-income housing tax credits and other related Federal income tax benefits to Torchmark.
Significantly all of the return on the investments has been guaranteed by unrelated third-parties and has been accounted for using the effective-yield method. The remaining investments are non-guaranteed and are accounted for using the
amortized-cost method. The federal income tax benefits accrued during the year, net of related amortization of the investment, is recorded in Income tax expense. The unamortized cost of the investments is included in Other assets and any unpaid
commitments to invest are recorded in Other liabilities.

Goodwill:

The excess cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets is reported as goodwill. In accordance with

SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing based on the
procedures outlined in the Statement. Amortization of goodwill is not permitted. Torchmark tested its goodwill annually in each of the years 2003 through 2005. As a result of the tests, Torchmark’s goodwill was not impaired in any of the
periods. Therefore, Torchmark continues to carry its goodwill at the January 1, 2003 balance of $378 million.

Treasury Stock:

Torchmark accounts for purchases of treasury stock on the cost method. Issuance of treasury stock is accounted for using the weighted-average
cost method.

Litigation Settlements:

In 2005, Torchmark settled
three significant legal matters. These cases involved Torchmark’s race-distinct mortality/dual-pricing litigation, its class-action cancer case, and its Waddell & Reed litigation. All of these cases related to litigation arising many years
ago. The Waddell & Reed litigation was settled with Torchmark recording the $13.5 million proceeds net of costs as “Other income.” The other two settlements resulted in a $15 million pre-tax charge to “Other operating
expenses.”

Stock Options:

Torchmark accounts for its
employee stock options in accordance with

SFAS 123

—

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

as amended by

SFAS 148

—

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

—

Transition

which defines a “fair value
method” of measuring and accounting for compensation expense from employee stock options. This standard also allows accounting for such options under the “intrinsic value method” in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25) and related interpretations. If a company elects to use the intrinsic value method, then pro forma disclosures of earnings and earnings per share are required as if the fair value
method of accounting was applied.

Torchmark has elected to account for
its stock options under the intrinsic value method as outlined in APB 25, and has therefore computed the required pro forma earnings disclosures utilizing the fair value method. The fair value method requires the use of an option valuation model to
value employee stock options. Torchmark uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to value its options, and pro forma compensation expense is based on these values. The pro forma expense is then charged to pro forma earnings over the option vesting
period. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense for Torchmark’s option grants is only recognized if the exercise price of the employee stock option is less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Torchmark’s pro forma earnings information is presented in the following table. The effects of applying
SFAS 123 in the pro forma disclosures are not necessarily indicative of future amounts.

In the second quarter of 2005,
Torchmark executed a voluntary option exercise and restoration program whereby directors and employees exercised their vested options and received a lesser number of new grants at the then current market price. All of these options vested during
2005. As a result of this transaction, Torchmark incurred $24.0 million in pro forma after-tax option expense in 2005. Additionally, a grant to executives made in December, 2004 vested in June, 2005. This grant accounted for $7.0 million of 2005
after-tax pro forma expense.

In December 2004, the FASB revised

Statement 123, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R),

originally effective for Torchmark as of July 1, 2005. In April, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission deferred the effective date applicable to Torchmark to January 1, 2006. This
Statement will require Torchmark to record an expense in the financial statements for stock options based on the “fair value method,” as presented in the pro forma disclosure above. While restatement of prior periods is permitted, the
Statement also permits a “modified prospective” method of adoption, whereby the expense of all unvested options as of January 1, 2006 and options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 are expensed in accordance with the Statement after
that date. Torchmark will elect the modified prospective method of adoption. Torchmark plans to continue to use the Black Scholes model to value its options under SFAS 123R.

The new Statement will cause minor changes to the option expense computations for Torchmark going forward from the pro forma expense
computations previously reported as follows:

1)

forfeiture credits are estimated at the time of grant instead of being reported when incurred.

2)

if an option fully vests upon an optionee’s retirement, the expense is accelerated to the earlier retirement date rather than the option’s normal vesting date as previously
recorded.

3)

if the deferred tax benefits recorded in connection with option expense exceeds the actual tax benefit realized upon exercise and the cumulative pool of such actual tax benefits allowed by
the Statement, there would be an additional charge for such excess taxes.

Had these rules been in effect in each of the three years ended December 31, 2005, option expense or earnings per share would not have varied materially from the pro forma results presented above. Furthermore, Torchmark does not consider
any of these new rules to materially affect option expense in future periods from that presented in the pro forma results, after removing the additional pro forma expense for the options granted in May, 2005 and in December, 2004 described above.
The Company presently estimates 2006 after-tax stock option expense to be approximately $4 million or $.04 per diluted share.

Earnings Per Share:

Torchmark presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the
income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adding to shares outstanding the additional net effect of
potentially dilutive securities or contracts, such as stock options, which could be exercised or converted into common shares. For more information on earnings per share, see

Note 2—Statutory Accounting

Life insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are required to file statutory financial statements with state insurance regulatory
authorities. Accounting principles used to prepare these statutory financial statements differ from GAAP. Consolidated net income and shareholders’ equity (capital and surplus) on a statutory basis for the insurance subsidiaries were as
follows:

Torchmark’s statutory financial statements are presented on the basis of
accounting practices prescribed by the insurance department of the state of domicile of each insurance subsidiary. All states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) statutory accounting practices (“NAIC
SAP”) as the basis for statutory accounting. However, certain states have retained the prescribed practices of their respective insurance code or administrative code which can differ from NAIC SAP. There are no significant differences between
NAIC SAP and the accounting practices prescribed by the state of domicile for Torchmark’s life insurance companies that affect statutory surplus except as noted in the chart below.

A schedule of fixed maturities
by contractual maturity at December 31, 2005 is shown below on an amortized cost basis and on a fair value basis. Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions.

Proceeds from sales of fixed
maturities available for sale were $78.0 million in 2005, $46.0 million in 2004, and $91.7 million in 2003. Gross gains realized on those sales were $7.6 million in 2005, $3.1 million in 2004, and $3.7 million in 2003. Gross losses were $13.7
million in 2005, $2.9 million in 2004, and $13.5 million in 2003. Proceeds from sales of equity securities were zero in 2005, $32.5 million in 2004, and $5.3 million in 2003. Gross gains realized on those sales were $4.7 million in 2004 and $1.5
million in 2003. Gross losses realized on those sales were $19 thousand in 2004 and zero in 2003.

Torchmark’s portfolio of fixed maturities fluctuates in value based on interest rates in financial markets and other economic factors. These fluctuations
caused by market rate changes have little bearing on whether or not the investment will be ultimately recoverable. Therefore, Torchmark considers



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 3—Investments (continued)

these declines in value as temporary even in periods exceeding one year. In certain circumstances, however, it may become apparent that the principal of an investment
may not be recoverable, generally due to factors specific to an individual issuer and not market interest rates. In this event, Torchmark classifies such investments as other-than-temporarily impaired and writes the investment down to fair value,
realizing an investment loss. The determination that a security is other-than-temporarily impaired is highly subjective and involves the careful consideration of many factors. These factors include:

•

Default on a payment

•

Issuer has declared bankruptcy

•

Severe deterioration in market value

•

Deterioration in credit quality as indicated by credit ratings

•

Issuer having serious financial difficulties as reported in the media

•

News releases by issuer

•

Information disseminated through the investment community

•

Length of time (duration) security has been impaired

While all available information is taken into account, it is difficult to predict the ultimately recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security. As of December 31, 2005,
Torchmark has no information available to cause it to believe that any of its investments are other-than-temporarily impaired.

The following tables disclose unrealized investment losses by class of investment at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Torchmark considers these investments
to be only temporarily impaired.

Torchmark had $5 million in investment real estate at December 31, 2005, which was
nonincome producing during the previous twelve months. These properties consisted primarily of undeveloped land. Torchmark had $10 million in nonincome producing mortgages as of December 31, 2005. Torchmark had no nonincome producing fixed
maturities or other long-term investments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005.

During 2003, Torchmark recorded a reserve against its mortgage loans on real estate as a result of impairments. The reserve resulted in a pretax loss of $5 million, or $3.3 million after tax.

During 2004, Torchmark decided to reduce its exposure to mortgage loans. As a result,
it sold mortgages with a carrying value of $75.7 million for proceeds of $74.4 million, resulting in a small loss. The sale included mortgages previously written down. As more fully described in

Note 4—Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased

An analysis of deferred acquisition costs and the value of insurance purchased is as follows:

(1)

In 2003, $10.9 million in disputed commissions paid in prior years to Waddell & Reed were returned in settlement. This amount reduced deferred commissions.

(2)

The unlocking adjustment resulted from revisions to actuarial assumptions related to guaranteed minimum death benefits in Torchmark’s variable annuity business.

(3)

Represents amounts pertaining to investments relating to universal life-type products.

The amount of interest accrued on the unamortized balance of value of insurance purchased was $4.1 million, $4.8 million, and $5.5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The average interest rates used for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were 5.6%, 5.7%, and 5.7%, respectively. The estimated amortization, net of interest accrued, on the
unamortized balance at December 31, 2005 during each of the next five years is: 2006, $6.1 million; 2007, $5.5 million; 2008, $5.0 million; 2009, $4.5 million; and 2010, $4.0 million.

In the event of lapses or early withdrawals in excess of those assumed, deferred
acquisition costs and the value of insurance purchased may not be recoverable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 8—Income Taxes (continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities are presented below:

Torchmark’s Federal income
tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Appeals division of the IRS and Torchmark agreed to settle all issues with respect to the Company’s 1996 and 1997 tax years. As a
result, Torchmark recorded a $15.9 million tax benefit in 2005 to reflect the impact of this settlement on the tax years covered by the examination as well as all other tax years prior to 2005 to which these issues apply. The benefit relates
primarily to Torchmark’s computation of the dividends received deduction on its separate account and the amount of life insurance reserves for income tax purposes. The IRS has completed its examinations of Torchmark’s 1998-2002 income tax
returns, with most of the proposed adjustments being referred to Appeals. The Federal income tax returns for 2003 and 2004 are not currently under examination. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for
any potential assessments that may result from the completed examinations, future tax examinations, and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.

A tax deferred component of statutory income accumulated prior to 1984 in a “policyholders’ surplus account” is not taxable unless it exceeds certain statutory limitations or is distributed to shareholders. As of December 31,
2004, Torchmark had not recognized a deferred tax liability of approximately $10 million that related to this accumulated income as management considered the situations causing taxation of the account to be remote. During 2004, the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 amended Federal income tax law to permit life insurance companies to distribute amounts from policyholders’ surplus accounts in 2005 and 2006 without incurring Federal income tax on the distributions. Each of the affected
insurance subsidiaries distributed to Torchmark all the amounts held in its policyholders’ surplus accounts in 2005, thereby permanently eliminating this potential liability for tax years after 2004.

Torchmark has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $20.3 million at
December 31, 2005 of which $120 thousand expire in 2008; $4.4 million expire in 2020; $4.6 million expire in 2021; and $11.2 million expire in 2025. A valuation allowance is to be provided when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets
will not be realized by the Company. No valuation allowance has been recorded relating to Torchmark’s deferred tax assets since, in management’s judgment, Torchmark will more likely than not have sufficient taxable income in future periods
to fully realize its existing deferred tax assets.

Torchmark accrues expense for
the defined contribution plans based on a percentage of the employees’ contributions. The plans are funded by the employee contributions and a Torchmark contribution equal to the amount of accrued expense. Plan contributions are both mandatory
and discretionary, depending on the terms of the plan.

Cost for the
defined benefit pension plans has been calculated on the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. All plan measurements for the defined benefit plans are as of December 31 of the respective year. The defined benefit pension plans covering the
majority of employees are funded. Contributions are made to the pension plans subject to minimums required by regulation and maximums allowed for tax purposes. Defined benefit plan contributions were $12.0 million in 2005, $10.7 million in 2004, and
$10.4 million in 2003. Torchmark estimates as of December 31, 2005 that it will contribute an amount not to exceed $20 million to these plans in 2006. The actual amount of contribution may be different from this estimate.

The excess benefit pension plan provides the benefits that an employee would have
otherwise received from a defined benefit pension plan in the absence of the Internal Revenue Code’s limitation on benefits payable under a qualified plan. This plan is limited to a select group of employees and was closed as of December 31,
1994. Although this plan is unfunded, pension cost is determined in the same manner as for the funded plans. Liability for the excess benefit plan was $5.8 million at December 31, 2005 and $5.8 million at December 31, 2004.

Plan assets in the funded plans consist primarily of investments in marketable fixed
maturities and equity securities and are valued at fair market value. The following table presents the assets of Torchmark’s defined benefit pension plans by component for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits (continued)

Torchmark’s investment objectives for its plan assets include preservation of capital, preservation of
purchasing power, and long-term growth. Torchmark seeks to preserve capital through investments made in high quality securities with adequate diversification to minimize risk. The portfolio is monitored continuously for changes in quality and
diversification mix. The preservation of purchasing power is intended to be accomplished through asset growth, exclusive of contributions and withdrawals, in excess of the rate of inflation. Torchmark intends to maintain investments that when
combined with future plan contributions will produce adequate long-term growth to provide for all plan obligations. It is also Torchmark’s objective that the portfolio’s investment return will meet or exceed the return of a balanced market
index.

All of the securities in the portfolio are highly marketable so
that there will be adequate liquidity to meet projected payments. There are no specific policies calling for asset durations to match those of benefit obligations.

Allowed investments are limited to equities, fixed maturities, and short-term investments (invested cash). Equities include common and
preferred stocks, securities convertible into equities, and mutual funds that invest in equities. Fixed maturities consist of marketable debt securities rated investment grade at purchase by a major rating agency. Short-term investments include
fixed maturities with maturities less than one year and invested cash. Target asset allocations are as follows with a twenty percent allowable variance as noted.

Short-term divergences due to rapid market

Portfolio risk is managed through quality
standards, diversification, and continuous monitoring. Equities must be listed on major exchanges and adequate market liquidity is required. Fixed maturities must be rated investment grade at purchase by a major rating agency. Short-term investments
in commercial paper must be rated at least A-2 by Standard & Poor’s with the issuer rated investment grade. Invested cash is limited to banks rated A or higher. Investments outside of the aforementioned list are not permitted, except by
prior approval of the Plans’ Trustees. At December 31, 2005, there were no restricted investments contained in the portfolio.

The investment portfolio is to be well diversified to avoid undue exposure to a single sector, industry, business, or security. The equity and fixed-maturity
portfolios are not permitted to invest in any single issuer that would exceed 10% of total plan assets at the time of purchase. Torchmark does not employ any other special risk management techniques, such as derivatives, in managing the pension
investment portfolio.

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits (continued)

The following table discloses the assumptions used to determine Torchmark’s pension liabilities and costs
for the appropriate periods. The discount and compensation increase rates are used to determine current year projected benefit obligations and subsequent year pension expense. The long-term rate of return is used to determine current year expense.
Differences between assumptions and actual experience are included in actuarial gain or loss.

Weighted Average Pension Plan Assumptions

The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets is management’s best estimate of the average rate of earnings expected to be received on the assets invested in the plan over the benefit period. In determining this assumption, consideration is given to the historical
rate of return earned on the assets, the projected returns over future periods, and the spread between the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to compute benefit obligations.

Net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit plans by expense component was as
follows:

The following table presents a reconciliation from the beginning to the end of the year of the benefit
obligation and plan assets. This table also presents a reconciliation of the plans’ funded status with the amounts recognized on Torchmark’s

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The accumulated benefit
obligations (ABO) for Torchmark’s funded defined benefit pension plans were $183.1 million and $155.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Plan assets exceeded the ABO in all of Torchmark’s funded pension plans at both
December 31, 2005 and 2004. In the unfunded plans, the ABO was $11.3 million at December 31, 2005 and $9.9 million at December 31, 2004.

Torchmark has estimated its expected pension benefits to be paid over the next ten years as of December 31, 2005. These amounts will be substantially funded by plan
assets and not corporate assets. These estimates use the same assumptions that measure the benefit obligation at December 31, 2005, taking estimated future employee service into account. Those estimated benefits are as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits (continued)

Postretirement Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions:

Torchmark provides a small postretirement life
insurance benefit for most retired employees, and also provides additional postretirement life insurance benefits for certain key employees. The majority of the life insurance benefits are accrued over the working lives of active employees.

For retired employees over age sixty-five, Torchmark does not provide
postretirement benefits other than pensions and the life insurance benefits described above. Torchmark does provide a portion of the cost for health insurance benefits for certain employees who retired before February 1, 1993 and for certain
employees that retired before age sixty-five, covering them until they reach age sixty-five. Eligibility for this benefit was generally achieved at age fifty-five with at least fifteen years of service. This subsidy is minimal to retired employees
who did not retire before February 1, 1993.

Torchmark’s
post-retirement defined benefit plans other than pensions are not funded. Liabilities for these plans are measured as of December 31 for the appropriate year.

The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for plans other than pensions are as follows:

The following table presents a
reconciliation of the benefit obligation and plan assets from the beginning to the end of the year and a reconciliation of the funded status to the accrued benefit liability:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits (continued)

On an aggregate basis, the post-retirement benefit obligation for the post-retirement plans other than pensions
was $13.7 million and $13.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The table below presents the assumptions used to determine the liabilities and costs of Torchmark’s post-retirement benefit plans other than pensions.

Weighted Average Assumptions for Post-Retirement

Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions

For measurement purposes of the
healthcare benefits, a range of 7-10% annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for the years 2003 through 2005. Torchmark has assumed that the health care cost trend rate will remain stable at the 7-10%
range in future periods. This trend rate assumption could have a significant effect on the amounts reported. However, because participants substantially pay the cost of this benefit, a 1% increase or decrease in the health care cost trend rate is
not expected to have a significant effect in the service and interest cost components, nor is the effect on the plan’s benefit obligation expected to exceed $1 thousand.

Note 10—Debt

An analysis of debt at carrying value is as follows:

(1)

Unamortized issue expenses related to Trust Preferred Securities.

(2)

Junior Subordinated Debentures included in “Due to affiliates” on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The amount of debt that becomes due during each of the next five years is: 2006—$382,000; 2007—$0; 2008—$0;
2009—$99,450; 2010—$0; and thereafter—$417,601.

Funded
debt:

During 2001, Torchmark established two Capital Trusts, which, in turn, sold a total of six million shares of Trust Preferred Securities (trust preferreds) in separate public offerings. The trust



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 10—Debt (continued)

preferreds were issued at a face amount of $150 million (par value), and are junior and subordinated to all other Torchmark debt. They pay a quarterly dividend at an
annual rate of 7


/


% which is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.9375 per share. All dividends are cumulative. The trust
preferreds are subject to a mandatory redemption on November 2, 2041, but Torchmark has the option to redeem the securities in part or whole at par value on or after November 2, 2006. All payments by the Capital Trusts regarding the trust preferreds
are guaranteed by Torchmark. The Capital Trusts in turn used the proceeds to buy 7

% Junior Subordinated Debentures from
Torchmark.

Effective January 1, 2004, Torchmark has
accounted for its Trust Preferred Securities under

FASB Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

as revised (FIN46R). FIN46R clarified the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE) and the determination of which
holder is the VIE’s primary beneficiary. Only primary beneficiaries are permitted to consolidate VIE’s. Therefore, FIN46R does not permit consolidation of VIE’s in which a company has voting control but is not the primary beneficiary.
The trusts that are liable for Torchmark’s trust preferreds meet the definition of VIE’s. Under FIN46R, Torchmark has no variable interest in these trusts and can therefore not be the entity’s primary beneficiary. For this reason,
Torchmark does not consolidate the trusts, even though Torchmark is the sole owner of the voting equity of these entities and guarantees their performance. Therefore, Torchmark does not report the trust preferreds as long-term debt but instead
reports its 7


/


% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2041 to the trust entities as “Due to Affiliates.” The
amount of this debt was $154.6 million at December 31, 2004 and 2005, $4.6 million greater than the par value of the trust preferreds. Deconsolidation of the trusts results in reporting $4.6 million of additional debt which is due to the trust
entities and is offset by an asset, included in “Other Receivables,” of a like amount representing Torchmark’s equity interest in the trusts. Also, the unamortized issue expenses of the trust preferreds of $5.5 million still remain as
a reduction of long-term debt. The additional interest expense on this debt exceeds the trust preferred distributions by $360 thousand in each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, which is offset by investment income to Torchmark in
like amount representing dividends from the trusts.

The
following table presents detailed information about the terms of Torchmark’s funded debt.

Interest rate swaps:

Torchmark has entered into swap agreements in connection with certain debt instruments to swap fixed-rate interest commitments to
floating rates. All swaps are carried at fair value and are classified as “Other long-term investments” on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In August, 2004, Torchmark entered into two new swap agreements exchanging its fixed 8.25%
interest rate of the Senior Debentures due 2009 and its fixed 7.375% interest rate of the Notes due 2013 for variable rates.

Commercial Paper:

On November 18, 2004, Torchmark entered into a credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by
letters of credit up to $600 million. The five-year facility matures on November 18, 2009. Interest is charged at variable rates. In addition, Torchmark can request up to $175 million letters of credit to be issued against the facility. The line of
credit is further designated as a back-up credit line for a commercial paper program, which cannot exceed $600 million. Torchmark may borrow from the credit facility or issue commercial paper, with total borrowings and commercial paper outstanding
not to exceed $600 million. At December 31, 2005, Torchmark had $202 million face amount ($202 million carrying amount) of commercial paper outstanding, $152 million of letters of credit issued, and no borrowings under the line of credit. During
2005, the short term borrowings under the combined facilities averaged approximately $219 million, and were made at an average yield of 3.3%, compared with 1.54% a year earlier. The facility does not have a ratings-based acceleration trigger which
would require early payment. A facility fee is charged for the entire $600 million facility at a rate of 8 basis points. For letters of credit issued, there is an issuance fee of 22 basis points and a fronting fee of 7.5 basis points. Additionally,
if borrowings on both the line of credit and letters of credit exceed 50% of



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 10—Debt (continued)

the total $600 million facility, there is a usage fee of 7.5 basis points. During 2005, Torchmark’s usage of the facility was below this threshold and no usage
fee was required. Torchmark is subject to certain covenants for the agreements regarding capitalization and earnings, with which it was in compliance at December 31, 2005. Borrowings on this facility are reported as short-term debt on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

There was no capitalized interest
during the three years ended December 31, 2005.

Note 11—Shareholders’
Equity

Share Data:

A summary of preferred and common share
activity is as follows:

Acquisition of Common Shares:

Torchmark shares are acquired from time to time through open market purchases under the Torchmark stock repurchase program when it is believed to be the best use of Torchmark’s excess cash flows. Share repurchases under this program were
5.6 million shares at a cost of $300 million in 2005, 5.2 million shares at a cost of $268 million in 2004, and 5.9 million shares at a cost of $225 million in 2003. When stock options are exercised, proceeds from the exercises are generally used to
repurchase approximately the number of shares available with those funds, closely simulating the treasury stock method of accounting for dilution. Shares repurchased for dilution purposes were 4.7 million shares costing $255 million in 2005 and 314
thousand shares at a cost of $17 million in 2004. There were no such purchases in 2003.

Retirement of Treasury Stock:

Torchmark retired 4 million shares of treasury stock in December, 2005. In 2004 and 2003, Torchmark also retired 5 million and 13 million treasury shares, respectively.

Restrictions:

Restrictions exist on the flow of funds to Torchmark from its
insurance subsidiaries. Statutory regulations require life insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus. Dividends from insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from
operations, excluding capital gains and losses, on an annual noncumulative basis, or 10% of surplus, in the absence of special regulatory approval. Additionally, insurance company distributions are generally not permitted in excess of statutory
surplus. Subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements. In 2005, subsidiaries of Torchmark paid $365 million in dividends to the parent company. During the year 2006, a maximum amount of $437 million is expected to be
available to Torchmark from subsidiaries without regulatory approval.

Note 11—Shareholders’ Equity (continued)

Earnings Per Share:

A reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used in
the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows:

Stock options to purchase 6.1
million shares, 946 thousand shares, and 3.3 million shares as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, are considered to be anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Income available to common
shareholders for basic earnings per share is equivalent to income available to common shareholders for diluted earnings per share.

Note 12—Stock Options

Certain employees, directors, and consultants have been granted options to buy shares of Torchmark stock, generally at the market value of the stock on the date of
grant, under the provisions of the various Torchmark stock option plans. The options are exercisable during the period commencing from the date they vest until expiring according to the terms of the grant. Options generally expire the earlier of
employee termination or option contract term, which ranges from seven to eleven years. Employee and consultant stock options generally vest one-half in two years and one-half in three years. Formula-based director grants generally vest in six
months. Stock options awarded in connection with compensation deferrals by certain directors and executives generally vest over a range of six to ten years. All options vest immediately upon the attainment of age 65, subject to a minimum vesting
period of one year for employees or six months for directors. Torchmark generally issues shares for the exercise of stock options from treasury stock.

During 2005, Torchmark shareholders approved two new stock option plans, the 2005 Employee Plan for 5,625,000 shares and the 2005 Director Plan for 375,000 shares.
Upon approval of these new plans, options previously available for grant under prior plans were cancelled and are no longer available for grant.

As described in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

, the Company executed a voluntary option exercise and restoration program in the second quarter
of 2005 whereby participants exercised vested options and received a lesser number of new options at the then current market price. As a result of this program, 5.8 million options were exercised resulting in that many shares being issued to
participants, but 4.7 million shares were immediately sold by participants to pay their exercise price and their withholding taxes. Optionees retained 1.1 million shares and were issued 4.1 million new options granted at a price of $54.77 per
Torchmark share.

An analysis of shares available for grant is as
follows:

As previously stated in

Note 13—Business Segments

Torchmark’s segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance,
health insurance, and annuities. These major product lines are set out as segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management
techniques. There is also an investment segment which manages the investment portfolio, debt, and cash flow for the insurance segments and the corporate function. Torchmark’s management evaluates the overall performance of the operations of the
Company in accordance with these segments.

Life insurance products
include traditional and interest-sensitive whole life insurance as well as term life insurance. Health products are generally guaranteed-renewable and include Medicare Supplement, cancer, accident, long-term care, and limited-benefit hospital and
surgical coverages. Annuities include both fixed-benefit and variable contracts. Variable contracts allow policyholders to choose from a variety of mutual funds in which to direct their deposits.

Torchmark markets its insurance products through a number of distribution channels,
each of which sells the products of one or more of Torchmark’s insurance segments. The tables below present segment premium revenue by each of Torchmark’s marketing groups.

Premium By Distribution Channel



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 13—Business Segments (continued)

Because of the nature of the life insurance industry, Torchmark has no individual or group which would be
considered a major customer. Substantially all of Torchmark’s business is conducted in the United States, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern regions.

The measure of profitability established by management for insurance segments is underwriting margin before other income and
administrative expenses, in accordance with the manner the segments are managed. It essentially represents gross profit margin on insurance products before insurance administrative expenses and consists of premium, less net policy obligations,
acquisition expenses, and commissions. Interest credited to net policy liabilities (reserves less deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased) is reflected as a component of the Investment segment in order to match this cost to the
investment earnings from the assets supporting the net policy liabilities.

The measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which represents the income earned on the investment portfolio in excess of net policy requirements and financing costs associated with Torchmark’s
debt. Other than the above-mentioned interest allocations, there are no other intersegment revenues or expenses. Expenses directly attributable to corporate operations are included in the “Corporate” category. All other unallocated
revenues and expenses on a pretax basis, including insurance administrative expense, are included in the “Other” segment category. The following tables set forth a reconciliation of Torchmark’s revenues and operations by segment to
its major income statement line items.

Torchmark holds a sizeable investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities, the yield from which is used to offset policy benefit, acquisition,
administrative and tax expenses. This yield or investment income is taken into account when establishing premium rates and profitability expectations of its insurance products. In holding such a portfolio, investments are sold, called, or written
down from time to time, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains or losses generally occur as a result of issuer calls, a downgrade in credit quality, or other reasons beyond management’s control. Unlike investment income, realized
gains and losses are incidental to insurance operations, and are not considered when setting premium rates or insurance product profitability expectations. While these gains and losses are not relevant to segment profitability or core operating
results, they can have a material positive or negative result on net income. For these reasons, management removes realized investment gains and losses when it views its segment operations.

Management has entered into swap derivative contracts to exchange certain of its
fixed-rate debt securities to floating rates to reduce its interest cost. For this reason, management views the difference between the floating-rate interest paid and the fixed-rate interest received (the “spread”) as an adjustment to its
financing cost in the Investment Segment and has reported it as such in this analysis. In accordance with current accounting rules, this spread on a non-hedged swap must be included in the same line item as the swap’s change in fair value each
period. Because of this rule, Torchmark includes the spread on all

swaps in Realized investment gains and losses in the

, as this is the line item that contains the fair value adjustment
each period.

The following table summarizes the measures of segment
profitability as determined in the three preceding tables for comparison with prior periods. The table also reconciles segment profits to net income.

Analysis of Profitability by Segment

Assets for each segment are
reported based on a specific identification basis. The insurance segments’ assets contain deferred acquisition costs, value of insurance purchased, and separate account assets. The investment segment includes the investment portfolio, cash, and
accrued investment income. Goodwill is assigned to the insurance segments based on SFAS 142. All other assets, representing less than 2% of total assets, are included in the other category. The table below reconciles segment assets to total assets
as reported in the consolidated financial statements.

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies

Reinsurance:

Insurance affiliates of Torchmark reinsure that portion of insurance risk which is in
excess of their retention limits. Retention limits for ordinary life insurance range up to $2.0 million per life. Life insurance ceded represents 1.2% of total life insurance in force at December 31, 2005. Insurance ceded on life and accident and
health products represents .5% of premium income for 2005. Torchmark would be liable for the reinsured risks ceded to other companies to the extent that such reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations.

Insurance affiliates also assume insurance risks of other companies. Life reinsurance
assumed represents 1.6% of life insurance in force at December 31, 2005 and reinsurance assumed on life and accident and health products represents .9% of premium income for 2005.

Leases:

Torchmark leases office space and office equipment under a variety of operating lease arrangements. Rental expense for
operating leases was $5.6 million in 2005, $5.2 million in 2004, and $4.7 million in 2003. Future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases having remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2005 were
as follows: 2006, $3.7 million; 2007, $2.7 million; 2008, $2.1 million; 2009, $1.6 million; 2010, $1.5 million and in the aggregate, $15.0 million.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests:

As described in

Note 1

, Torchmark has committed to invest $122 million in entities which provide certain tax
benefits. As of December 31, 2005, Torchmark remained obligated under these commitments for $65.8 million, of which $44.3 million is due in 2006, $15.1 million in 2007, and $6.4 million in 2008.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Torchmark maintains a highly diversified
investment portfolio with limited concentration in any given region, industry, or economic characteristic. At December 31, 2005, the investment portfolio, at fair value, consisted of the following:

Investments in municipal
governments and corporations are made throughout the U.S. with no concentration in any given state. Corporate debt and equity investments are made in a wide range of industries. At December 31, 2005, 2% or more of the portfolio was invested in the
following industries:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Otherwise, no individual industry represented 2% or more of Torchmark’s investments. At year-end 2005, 7%
of invested assets was represented by fixed maturities rated below investment grade (BB or lower as rated by the Bloomberg Composite or the equivalent NAIC designation). Par value of these investments was $670 million, amortized cost was $671
million, and fair value was $676 million. While these investments could be subject to additional credit risk, such risk should generally be reflected in market value.

Collateral Requirements:

Torchmark requires collateral for investments in instruments where collateral is available and is
typically required because of the nature of the investment. Since the majority of Torchmark’s investments is in government, government-secured, or corporate securities, the requirement for collateral is rare. Torchmark’s mortgages are
secured by the underlying real estate.

Guarantees:

At December
31, 2005, Torchmark had in place five guarantee agreements, four of which were either parent company guarantees of subsidiary obligations to a third party, or parent company guarantees of obligations between wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of December
31, 2005, Torchmark had no liability with respect to these guarantees. The fifth guarantee related to third party performance.

Trust Preferred Securities

: Torchmark entered into a performance guarantee for the obligations of the Torchmark Capital Trusts I and II when
the trust preferred securities were issued by those trusts. It guarantees payment of distributions and the redemption price of the securities until the securities are redeemed in full, or all obligations have been satisfied should one or both of the
Capital Trusts default on an obligation. The total redemption price of the trust preferred securities is $150 million.

Letters of Credit

: Torchmark has guaranteed letters of credit in connection with its credit facility with a group of banks. The letters of
credit were issued by TMK Re, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to secure TMK Re, Ltd.’s obligation for claims on certain policies reinsured by TMK Re, Ltd. that were sold by other Torchmark insurance companies. These letters of credit
facilitate TMK Re, Ltd.’s ability to reinsure the business of Torchmark’s insurance carriers. The agreement is a five-year contract expiring in 2009. The maximum amount of letters of credit available is $175 million. Torchmark (parent
company) would be liable to the extent that TMK Re, Ltd. does not pay the reinsured party. At December 31, 2005, $152 million of letters of credit were outstanding.

Agent Receivables

: Torchmark issued a guarantee to an unaffiliated third party, which has purchased certain
agents’ receivables of Torchmark’s wholly-owned subsidiary American Income Life Insurance Company. The guarantee covers all obligations and recovery of capital to the third party under the receivables purchase agreement up to a maximum
amount of $95 million. Under the terms of the revolving purchase arrangement, the third party has purchased the agents’ receivables and receives the earned commissions as they are applied to the balance. The term of the guarantee corresponds
with the purchase arrangement, which is annually renewable. Torchmark would be liable to the extent that future commission collections were insufficient to repay the purchased amount. As of December 31, 2005, the present value of future commissions
substantially exceeded the purchased balance.

Equipment leases

: Torchmark has guaranteed performance of two subsidiaries as lessees under leasing arrangements for aviation equipment. The leases commenced in 2003 for lease terms of approximately 10 years. Lessees have certain
renewal and early termination options, however. At December 31, 2005, total remaining undiscounted payments under the leases were approximately $6.2 million. Torchmark (parent company) would be responsible for any subsidiary obligation in the event
the subsidiary did not make payments or otherwise perform under the terms of the lease.

Personal loans

: Torchmark subsidiary American Income is a party to an agreement to
guarantee certain personal loans of American Income employees and agents with First Command Bank. First Command Bank is a subsidiary of First Command Services, Inc. (First Command) of which Lamar C. Smith is chairman and CEO. Mr. Smith is also a
director of Torchmark. At December 31, 2005, the balance subject to this guarantee was $182 thousand. These guarantees are secured by vested commissions due the employees and agents. See

information on Mr. Smith and First Command.

Litigation:

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged
wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. A number of such actions involving Torchmark’s subsidiary Liberty also name Torchmark as a defendant.
Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark’s
financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This
bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as Alabama and Mississippi.

Many of these lawsuits involve claims for punitive damages in state courts of Alabama and Mississippi. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive
damage awards continue to occur bearing little or no relation to actual damages awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark has substantial business, particularly Alabama and Mississippi, creating the potential for unpredictable material
adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit. As of December 31, 2005, Liberty was a party to approximately 76 active lawsuits (which included no employment-related cases and excluded interpleaders), 61 of which were Alabama proceedings and 4
of which were Mississippi proceedings in which punitive damages were sought.

As previously reported in Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q, Liberty National Life Insurance Company is a party to a number of lawsuits (both a large number of lawsuits brought by individual plaintiffs and class action litigation with extremely
broad class periods and relief sought) involving allegations of racially discriminatory pricing in the sale of insurance to African Americans prior to 1966. The litigation began with the December 8, 1999 filing of

Moore v. Liberty National
Life Insurance Company

, Case No. CV-99-BU-3262-S in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Over 29 race-distinct mortality cases with approximately 2,000 named plaintiffs have been consolidated with the

Moore

case
(Master Case No. 2:02-CV-02741-UWC) and are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, with one pending Alabama Circuit Court case (

Baldwin v. Liberty National Life Insurance Company

, Case No. CV-00-684)
stayed pending a disposition of the

Moore

case.

The
previously-reported December 5, 2005 trial date fixed by the U.S. District Court for

Moore

was reset by that Court to January 18, 2006. On January 18, 2006, all parties to

Moore

submitted a Joint Motion for Preliminary
Approval of Settlement and a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement in that case to the District Court. After a hearing, the District Court entered an Order Preliminarily Approving Proposed Settlement on January 25, 2006. In the
Order, the District Court preliminarily approved the Proposed Settlement Agreement; conditionally certified a settlement class defined as “All black Americans who have (or had at the time of the policy’s termination) an ownership or other
legal interest in an industrial life insurance policy or burial policy issued by Liberty National Life Insurance Company, or one of its former subsidiaries, Service Insurance Company of Alabama, or Burial Service Insurance Company of Alabama on or
before January 10, 1966, at a higher rate than similar plans offered to similarly situated white Americans”; certified the class representatives and class counsel; found that the claims in the case were primarily equitable and that the
primary relief under the proposed Settlement was injunctive and equitable, with incidental monetary relief in the form of restitution not to

exceed $6 million in the aggregate; approved and directed the giving of notice to class members in the manner and form set out in the Proposed Settlement Agreement
beginning February 3, 2006; and fixed March 31, 2006 as the date for the fairness hearing. Pursuant to the Order, Liberty commenced dissemination of notice to class members on February 3, 2006. If approved, the Settlement will
substantially resolve all class action issues in race-distinct pricing litigation at Liberty, except for certain consolidated individual claims for mental anguish and punitive damages previously asserted by approximately 2,000 individual plaintiffs,
which claims are expressly excluded from the proposed Settlement. The Company intends to vigorously defend those claims. Additional information regarding the race-distinct mortality/dual pricing litigation can be found in the Company’s prior
Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q.

As previously reported in Form 10-Q, United
American Insurance Company has been named as a defendant in purported class action litigation filed on September 16, 2004, in the Circuit Court of Saline County, Arkansas on behalf of the Arkansas purchasers of association group health
insurance policies or certificates issued by United American through Heartland Alliance of America Association and Farm & Ranch Healthcare, Inc. (

Smith and Ivie v. Collingsworth, et al.,

CV2004-742-2). The plaintiffs assert claims
for fraudulent concealment, breach of contract, common law liability for non-disclosure, breach of fiduciary duties, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and violation of Arkansas law and the
rules and regulations of the Arkansas Insurance Department. Declaratory, injunctive and equitable relief, as well as actual and punitive damages are sought by the plaintiffs. United American removed the case from the Saline County Circuit Court to
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, but the District Court ordered the case back to the Circuit Court on December 21, 2005. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied United American’s
petition for permission to appeal the District Court’s decision on January 25, 2006.

Liberty National Life Insurance Company and an unrelated Glendale, California mortuary were named as defendants in a purported class action litigation filed December 8, 2005 in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County,
California (

Gibson v. Liberty National Life Insurance Company

, Case No. BC344178) on behalf of California holders of certain funeral services insurance policies. The plaintiff in

Gibson

asserts claims for breach of contractual duty to
pay a covered claim under a funeral services insurance policy, breach of the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing by unreasonably failing to pay and/or delaying payments of insurance benefits, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and
unfair business practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code Section 17000 et seq. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified compensatory and general damages, exemplary damages, injunctive and declaratory relief and
attorneys’ fees and costs.

Note 15—Related Party Transactions

First Command.

Lamar C. Smith, a director of Torchmark, is an officer and
director of First Command Financial Services, Inc. (First Command), a corporation 100% owned by the First Command Employee Stock Ownership Plan (First Command ESOP). Mr. Smith is a beneficiary of the First Command ESOP although he has no ability to
vote the stock of First Command that is held by the First Command ESOP. First Command receives commissions as the Military Agency distribution system for selling certain life insurance products offered by Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries.
These commissions were $60.9 million in 2005, $67.0 million in 2004, and $59.4 million in 2003. Torchmark held balances due from these agents of $9.4 million at year-end 2005 and $17.0 million at year-end 2004.

During 2001, Torchmark entered into a coinsurance agreement with First Command’s
life subsidiary whereby Torchmark ceded back to First Command approximately 5% of the new life insurance business sold by First Command on behalf of Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries. In 2004, the ceding rate was changed to 3% on newly ceded
business. Under the terms of this agreement, First Command pays Torchmark a maintenance expense allowance equal to 5.5% of all premium collected and an issue allowance of 2.9% of first year premium collected. Torchmark is also reimbursed for actual
commissions, premium taxes, and claims paid on the business ceded to First Command. Also under the agreement, Torchmark provides First Command certain administrative, accounting, and investment management services. Premium ceded in 2005 was $2.6
million, in 2004 was $2.3 million, and in 2003 was $1.6 million. At December 31, 2005, the face amount of life insurance ceded was $316 million and annualized ceded premium was $2.7 million.

Torchmark currently has two loan agreements with First Command, a mortgage loan
agreement and a collateral loan agreement. The mortgage loan bears interest at a rate of 7.0%. The initial balance of $22.3 million is being repaid in equal monthly payments over fifteen years, beginning May 1, 2003. At year end 2005, the
outstanding balance was $19.9 million, compared with $20.9 million one year ago. The loan is collateralized by a four-story office building in Fort Worth, Texas, which was appraised by an independent firm in 2001 at $22.8 million. In addition to the
office building as collateral, Torchmark has the right of offset to any commissions due First Command, in the event of default.

The collateral loan bears interest at the rate of 7.0%. First Command is making fixed monthly payments which are scheduled to repay the loan by May, 2010. First
Command has the right to make additional, unscheduled payments. At year end 2005, the outstanding balance was $9.3 million, compared with $11.1 million at year end 2004. The loan is collateralized by real estate and a parking garage in Fort Worth,
Texas. The property was appraised by an independent firm in 2002 at $17.6 million.

As disclosed in

Note 14—Commitments and

C

ontingencies

, Torchmark subsidiary American Income is a party to an agreement to guarantee certain personal loans of American Income employees and agents with First
Command Bank, a subsidiary of First Command. At December 31, 2005, the balance subject to this guarantee was $182 thousand. These guarantees are secured by vested commissions due the employees and agents.

Richey

.    R. K. Richey, Chairman of the Executive Committee
of Torchmark until April 2005 and formerly a director and chief executive officer of Torchmark, is a minority investor in a real estate management company, Commercial Real Estate Services (CRES). CRES manages certain of Torchmark’s
company-occupied and investment real estate properties along with those of other clients. Fees paid by Torchmark subsidiaries for these management and maintenance services were $680 thousand in 2005, $702 thousand in 2004, and $683 thousand in 2003.
Mr. Richey is also a 50% investor in Stonegate Realty Company, LLC., the parent company of Elgin Development Company, LLC. (Elgin Development). Elgin Development leases commercial space to Torchmark subsidiaries. Lease rentals paid by Torchmark
subsidiaries were $262 thousand, $261 thousand, and $261 thousand in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Torchmark annually pays premiums on three life insurance policies for Mr. Richey, in the amount of $61 thousand in each of the years 2003 through 2005.

Executive share purchases.

On January 3, 2005, two grantor-retained annuity
trusts for the benefit of the adult sons of C. B. Hudson, Chief Executive Officer of Torchmark at that time, and of which trusts he serves as trustee, sold 41,470 shares of Torchmark common stock in a privately-negotiated transaction to Torchmark
for $2.4 million. The purchases (20,735 shares from each of the trusts) were made at the average of the high and low prices of Torchmark stock on January 3, 2005 ($57.045 per share).

MidFirst Bank.

Torchmark has engaged MidFirst Bank as the servicing agent for a portion of
Torchmark’s subsidiaries’ commercial mortgages portfolios. George J. Records, a Torchmark director until April 27, 2005, was also an officer, director, and 38.3% beneficial owner of Midland Financial Co., the parent corporation of MidFirst
Bank until December 31, 2003. After that date, he was no longer a beneficial owner. Fees paid for MidFirst Bank’s services were $90 thousand in 2004 and $110 thousand in 2003. No fees were paid in 2005.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, a reserve in the pretax amount of $5 million was
established on certain mortgages that met Torchmark’s criteria for impairment. These mortgages were originated and serviced by MidFirst. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Torchmark’s subsidiary Liberty sold its participation interests in
certain mortgages back to MidFirst Bank in two transactions. The first transaction was completed in October, 2004 for proceeds of $57.3 million with a carrying value of $56.2 million, and the second was effected in December, 2004 for $17.1 million
proceeds and a carrying value of $19.5 million. Because of Mr. Records’ relationship, the Board of Directors of Torchmark, with Mr. Records recusing himself, reviewed and approved the first transaction. Both of the transactions were also
reviewed and approved by the Liberty National Board of Directors on which Mr. Records did not serve. Torchmark obtained opinions from an independent third party valuation firm experienced in valuing commercial loans that the purchase price on each
transaction was within a reasonable and acceptable range.

Baxley.

William J. Baxley is a partner in the law firm of Baxley, Dillard, Dauphin, McKnight & Barclift which performs legal services for Torchmark and certain of its subsidiaries. In 1997, Mr. Baxley was
loaned $668 thousand on an unsecured basis at a rate of 6.02%. Repayments are made in the form of legal services at customary rates and are applied against the outstanding balance, amortizing the loan with interest over its remaining term. In
October, 2001, the terms of the loan were revised and an additional amount of $395 thousand was loaned to Baxley. The interest rate was revised to 5.6% and the term of the loan was extended until July, 2013. The loan is being repaid in accordance
with its amortization schedule and all payments are current. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding balance of this loan was $572 thousand and $632 thousand, respectively.

Additionally, Liberty loaned Mr. Baxley’s wife $883 thousand secured by a mortgage on a building sold to her in 1997. Interest is
charged at a rate of 7.7%. Scheduled cash payments are made to amortize the loan over thirty years. However, there is a balloon payment due at the end of ten years (2007) in the amount of $712 thousand less a credit of $18 thousand if all payments
are made timely. To date, all payments have been timely. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding balance of this loan was $751 thousand and $772 thousand, respectively.

Torchmark customarily grants options to certain consultants for their services in addition to their fees. Mr. Baxley received
Torchmark options in 2005, 2004, and 2003.

The following is a summary of quarterly results for the two years ended December 31, 2005. The information is
unaudited but includes all adjustments (consisting of normal accruals) which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods.

*

In 2005, Torchmark recorded settlements on three significant legal matters. The first settlement related to the Waddell & Reed litigation and resulted in $13.5 million of additional
revenue in the second quarter. The other two cases were Torchmark’s race-distinct mortality/dual-pricing litigation and its class-action cancer case. These two cases involved charges of $4 million in the second quarter and $11 million in the
fourth quarter. The after-tax effect of these items was a positive $6 million in the second quarter and a charge of $7 million in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter of 2005, Torchmark recorded a $16 million settlement benefit from an
Internal Revenue Service examination covering several years. More information on these litigation and tax settlements is provided in

Item 9.    Disagreements on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

No disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure have been reported on a Form 8-K within the
twenty-four months prior to the date of the most recent financial statements.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Torchmark, under the direction of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Torchmark in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to Torchmark’s management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

As of the end of the fiscal quarter completed December 31, 2005, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of Torchmark management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of Torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures (as those terms are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon their evaluation, the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this Form 10-K. In compliance with Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C. § 1350), each of these officers executed a Certification included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

As of the date of this Form 10-K for the fiscal year and the quarter ended December 31, 2005, there have not been any significant changes in Torchmark’s
internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect this control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of their evaluation which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting. No material weaknesses in such internal controls were identified in the evaluation and as a consequence, no corrective action was required to be taken.



Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management at Torchmark Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis. As a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting, the Company utilizes the criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

Management evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and based on its assessment, believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. The
Company’s independent audit firm has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein.

February 27, 2006



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Torchmark Corporation

Birmingham, Alabama

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,

that Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries (“Torchmark”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Torchmark’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that Torchmark maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, Torchmark maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 of Torchmark and our report dated February 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
