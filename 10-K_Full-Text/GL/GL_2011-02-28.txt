PART I

Item 1.    Business

Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark) is an insurance holding company
incorporated in Delaware in 1979. Its primary subsidiaries are American Income Life Insurance Company (American Income), Liberty National Life Insurance Company (Liberty), Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company (Globe), and United American
Insurance Company (United American).

Torchmark’s
website is: www.torchmarkcorp.com. Torchmark makes available free of charge through its website, its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as
reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The following table presents Torchmark’s business by primary marketing distribution method.

Additional information concerning industry segments may be found in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Insurance

Life Insurance

Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries write a variety of nonparticipating ordinary life insurance products. These
include traditional and interest sensitive whole-life insurance, term life insurance, and other life insurance. The following table presents selected information about Torchmark’s life products.

The distribution methods for life
insurance products include sales by direct response, exclusive agents and independent agents. These methods are described in more depth in the Distribution Method chart earlier in this report. The following table presents life annualized premium in
force by distribution method.

Health Insurance

Torchmark offers supplemental limited-benefit health insurance
products that include primarily cancer and accident plans. These policies are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own. Medicare Supplements are also offered to enrollees in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.
Medicare Supplement plans are standardized by federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles and co-payments not paid by Medicare. We also offer Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance.



Index to Financial Statements

The following table presents supplemental health annualized premium in force information for the three
years ended December 31, 2010 by product category.

The number of health policies in force
(excluding Medicare Part D) was 1.57 million, 1.66 million, and 1.54 million at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Medicare Part D enrollees at December 31, 2010 were approximately 144 thousand to begin the 2011 plan
year.

The following table presents supplemental health
annualized premium in force for the three years ended December 31, 2010 by marketing (distribution) method.

Annuities

Annuity products offered include single-premium and flexible-premium
deferred annuities. Annuities in each of the three years ending December 31, 2010 comprised less than 1% of premium.

Pricing

Premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, and expenses,
all of which are generally based on Company experience and on projected investment earnings. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the
policyholder account values on certain individual life products. Profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for
policy reserves.

Collections for annuity products and
certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the
extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts.



Index to Financial Statements

Underwriting

The underwriting standards of each Torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information from the
application and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different
rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage or rejected.

Reserves

The life insurance policy reserves reflected in
Torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These reserves, with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at
assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most
of the health policies written by Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. A list of the assumptions used in the calculation of Torchmark’s reserves are reported in the
financial statements (

See

Note 6

—

Future

Policy Benefit Reserves

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the
policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments.

Investments

The nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Torchmark insurance
subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Fixed maturities represented 94% of total investments at fair value at December 31, 2010. (

)

Competition

Torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance
companies competing with Torchmark, no individual company dominates any of Torchmark’s life or health markets.

Torchmark’s health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance
organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements.

Management believes Torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows
Torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.

Regulation

Insurance.

Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The
laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy
forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. They are also required to
file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined
periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.



Index to Financial Statements

Risk Based Capital.

The NAIC requires a risk based capital formula be
applied to all life and health insurers. The risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank
companies that are adequately capitalized. All Torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula.

Guaranty Assessments.

State guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used,
in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company, to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders. The amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each
state. Assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes.

Holding Company.

States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or
are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, and New York.

Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose
various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.

Personnel

At the end of 2010, Torchmark had 2,224 employees and 1,067 licensed
employees under sales contracts.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business

Product Marketplace and Operational Risks:

The insurance industry is a mature, regulated industry, populated by
many firms. We operate in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks.

The development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and
profits.

Because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development,
maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. We compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and
compensation. Adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical, as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time. Increased
competition has led to a reduction in agents in our United American Branch Office Agency and United American Independent Agency, which have historically been our major health distribution channels. In direct response, continuous development of new
offerings and cost efficiency are key. Less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits.

Economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We serve primarily the middle-income market for
individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income. If disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes
more limited, as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether.

Variations in expected to actual rates of mortality,
morbidity, and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. These reserves do not
represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. The reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with
respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. Even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the
levels assumed when premium rates were first set. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. Significant variations from the levels assumed when policy
reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income.

A ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Various rating
agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations.
These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products, our ability to market these products and our competitive position. A downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength
ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance
products through our independent agencies.

Rating agencies
also publish credit ratings for us. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. These ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity.
Actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including limiting our access to capital markets,
increasing the cost of debt,



Index to Financial Statements

impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, and making it more difficult to maintain or
improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.

Ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate to
the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control. In addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the
strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. Changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. There can be
no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so
warrant. We cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Life Insurance Marketplace Risk:

Our life products are sold in selected niche markets. We are at
risk should any of these markets diminish.

We have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response distribution. The contraction of the size of either
market could adversely affect sales. In recent years, labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers. Most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail or by
insertion into other mail media for distribution. Significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business.

Health Insurance Marketplace Risks:

Congress could make changes to the Medicare program which could
impact our Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance business. Medicare Supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our in-force health insurance business.

Because of increasing
medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the Medicare program, it is possible that changes will be made to the Medicare program by Congress in the future. The nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a
material adverse effect on that business.

Our Medicare
Supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers.

Our Medicare Supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to
traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans. The success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional Medicare Supplement
insurance.

Our Medicare Supplement and other health
insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales.

In recent years, price competition in the traditional Medicare Supplement market, as well as the
market for other health products, has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share. We have elected not to compete on those terms,
which has negatively affected sales. Should these industry practices continue, it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed.

An inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

A significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from Medicare Supplement insurance. Medicare Supplement
insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. As a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict
administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. Because Medicare Supplement policies are



Index to Financial Statements

coordinated with the federal Medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the Medicare Supplement policies are necessary. Obtaining
timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. Accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in
the future could adversely impact their profitability.

Investment Risks:

Our investments are subject to market and credit
risks.

Our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. A
significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. Factors
that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of
each issuer. Additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with
market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. These declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio.
Significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity. It is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or
all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. In that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income.

Difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries
in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment
losses.

Difficult conditions in U.S. capital markets in recent periods caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments. If difficulties within these businesses and industries
increase, there could be deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us. If conditions in the capital markets worsen, we could experience credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio.

A default by an issuer could result in a significant
other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. The risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term
insurance obligations. We attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. Also, while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in
order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio, a significant amount of our investments is in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, which have experienced an increased level of downgrades in recent years.
Moreover, we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. Material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory
surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. While we intend to hold our investments until
maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments. Current net income would be
negatively impacted by the writedowns, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income.

A decline in interest rates could negatively affect income.

Declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to
the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities. While we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide
no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. Significant



Index to Financial Statements

decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. These calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as
reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates.

Liquidity
Risks:

Our liquidity to fund operations is
substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries.

As a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries,
which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. Moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us,
as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds
to us. Other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper and medium- and long-term debt.

The principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are
insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance
companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. For example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an
insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. Additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of
prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. Accordingly, a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations could reduce
their capital or cash flow and, as a result, limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow.

We can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. Although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. Additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in
a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. Limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our
ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock.

Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital.

The capital and
credit markets have recently experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time. In some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers.
Additionally, should credit spreads widen again in the future, the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. If the credit and capital markets were to experience
significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the
capital necessary to grow our business.

In the unlikely
event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. The availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general
availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. Additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative
perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities



Index to Financial Statements

or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional
financing on favorable terms, or at all. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our
financial flexibility. Therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets.

Regulatory Risks:

Our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth.

Insurance
companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. The primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our
investors. State agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing
practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or
approvals. The insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting Torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and
approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. If we do not have the
requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines.

We cannot predict the timing or substance of any future
regulatory initiatives. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of
disclosure documents. These regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties,
or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent
any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our
practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Record and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 establishes a Federal Insurance Office (FIO), whose duties have not yet been defined, within the Department of the Treasury and the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act created the Center for Consumer Information and
Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), originally established under the Department of Health and Human Services and subsequently transferred to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The creation of these insurance regulatory offices may
indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the regulation of the insurance industry. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the FIO and CCIIO, as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have
on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs.

Changes to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry
could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income.

Changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability.

Our financial statements are
subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are



Index to Financial Statements

required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could
change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, standard setters have a full
agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability.

If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates
who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.

The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of
individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws
address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) and in the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Noncompliance with any privacy laws or
any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation
and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief.

Litigation Risk:

Litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries.

We are,
and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large
and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. However, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. A
number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly
supervise agents, and other matters. These lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. In some states in which we
operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. This discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit.

Our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of
settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation,
which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects.

Catastrophic Event Risk:

Our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events.

Our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the United
States in relatively low-face amounts. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. However, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic
mortality, caused by events such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism, or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area. These events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in
any period and, depending on their severity and geographic scope, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity
of the event. Pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, and man-



Index to Financial Statements

made catastrophes, including terrorism and war, may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic
events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition.

Information Technology Risk:

The occurrence of computer viruses, network security breaches,
disasters, or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of Torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

A
computer virus could affect the data processing systems of Torchmark or its subsidiaries, destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business. In addition, despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers could be
subject to physical and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.

We retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those
systems. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and
proprietary business information. In addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. Any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in
inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require
us to incur significant technical, legal, and other expenses.

In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may
be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. Even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

As of December 31, 2010, Torchmark had no unresolved staff comments.

Item 2.    Properties

Torchmark, through its subsidiaries, owns or leases buildings that are
used in the normal course of business. Torchmark owns and occupies a 290,000 square foot facility located in McKinney, Texas (a north Dallas suburb). This facility is Torchmark’s corporate headquarters and also houses the operations of United
American.

Liberty owns a 487,000 square foot building in
Birmingham, Alabama which until 2010 served as Liberty’s home office. During 2010, Liberty vacated this building and currently operates its home office activities out of a 34,000 square foot facility leased in a Birmingham suburb. Approximately
15,000 square feet of storage space has also been leased near the new home office facility. Liberty also operates from 4 company-owned district offices used for agency sales personnel. Liberty is currently in the process of selling its remaining
company-owned office buildings, including its former home office building, opting instead to operate from leased facilities.

A subsidiary of Globe owns a 112,000 square foot facility located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma which houses the Globe direct response operation.
During 2008, Globe sold two office buildings located in Oklahoma City. The first was a 300,000 square foot building in which Globe previously occupied 56,000 square feet as its home office with the remainder either leased or available for lease.
After the sale, Globe continued to occupy 37,000 square feet under a lease expiring in April, 2011. The other sold building was vacant, and consisted of 80,000 square feet.

American Income owns and is the sole occupant of an office building
located in Waco, Texas. The building is a two-story structure containing approximately 72,000 square feet of usable floor space. American Income also owns a 43,000 square foot facility located in Waco which houses the American Income direct response
operation.

Liberty and United American also lease district
office space for their agency sales personnel.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including
claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other
causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on
Torchmark’s financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in
the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as Alabama and Mississippi. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to
actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, particularly Alabama and Mississippi, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any
given punitive damage suit.

As previously disclosed in
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), United American was named as a defendant in purported class action litigation originally filed on September 16, 2004, in the Circuit Court of Saline County, Arkansas on behalf of the
Arkansas purchasers of association group health insurance policies or certificates issued by United American through Heartland Alliance of America Association and Farm & Ranch Healthcare, Inc. (

Smith and Ivie v. Collingsworth, et al.,

CV2004-742-2). The plaintiffs asserted claims for fraudulent concealment, breach of contract, common law liability for non-disclosure, breach of fiduciary duties, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade
Practices Act, and violation of Arkansas law and the rules and regulations of the Arkansas Insurance Department. Declaratory, injunctive, and equitable relief, as well as actual and punitive damages, were sought by the plaintiffs. On September 7,
2005, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to assert a nation-wide class, defined as all United American insureds who simultaneously purchased both an individual Hospital and Surgical Expense health insurance policy (Form HSXC) and an individual
supplemental term life insurance policy (Form RT85) from Farm & Ranch through Heartland. Defendants removed this litigation to the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas



Index to Financial Statements

(No. 4:05-cv-1382) but that Court remanded the litigation back to the state court on plaintiffs’ motion. On July 22, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, asserting a class
defined as “all persons who, between January 1998 and the present, were residents of Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana or Texas, and purchased through Farm & Ranch: (1) a health insurance policy issued by United American known as
Flexguard Plan, CS-1 Common Sense Plan, GSP Good Sense Plan, SHXC Surgical & Hospital Expense Policy, HSXC 7500 Hospital/Surgical Plan, MMXC Hospital/Surgical Plan, SMXC Surgical/Medical Expense Plan and/or SSXC Surgical Safeguard Expense Plan,
and (ii) a membership in Heartland.” Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract, violation of Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and/or applicable consumer protection laws in other states, unjust enrichment, and common law fraud.
Plaintiffs seek actual, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, equitable and declaratory relief. On September 8, 2009, the Saline County Circuit Court granted the plaintiff’s motion certifying the class. On October 7, 2009, United
American filed its notice of appeal of the class certification and subsequently filed its appellate brief on April 8, 2010. On December 2, 2010, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s decision to certify the class. Discovery is
ongoing.

As reported in previous SEC filings, on June 3,
2009, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (Florida Office) issued an order to Liberty National to show cause why the Florida Office should not issue a final order suspending or revoking Liberty National’s certificate of authority to do
insurance business in the State of Florida. The order asserted that Liberty National has engaged in alleged unfair trade practices in violation of Florida law through past underwriting practices used by Liberty National with regard to insurance
applications submitted by persons who live in the United States but who were not U.S. citizens and persons traveling to certain foreign countries. Liberty National denies the allegations made by the Florida Office. Liberty National responded to the
Florida Office’s order in a timely manner and the matter was transmitted to the Division of Administrative Hearings on July 10, 2009. The matter was assigned to an administrative law judge and was set for hearing commencing on February 1, 2010.
On January 21, 2010, the Florida Office filed a motion for continuance which was granted and the hearing in the Florida Department of Administrative Hearings was held June 7-11, 2010. Each of the parties submitted proposed orders to the
Administrative Law Judge on August 18, 2010 for her review. On November 9, 2010, the Administrative Law Judge issued a recommended order and transmitted it to all parties. The Florida Office filed exceptions to the order and Liberty National filed
its response to those exceptions as well as its own exceptions on December 3, 2010. On February 9, 2011, the Florida Office issued a Final Order that essentially adopted the Administrative Law Judge’s previously recommended findings of fact and
conclusions of law. However, in its Final Order, the Florida Office increased the recommended fines for the four non-willful violations and trebled the fine for each non-willful violation resulting in a total fine of $60,000. A decision whether or
not the Final Order will be appealed has not been made.

As
previously reported in filings with the SEC, on September 23, 2009, purported class action litigation was filed against American Income Life Insurance Company in the Superior Court of San Bernardino County, California (

Hoover v. American Income
Life Insurance Company

, Case No. CIVRS 910758). The plaintiffs, former insurance sales agents of American Income who are suing on behalf of all current and former American Income sales agents in California for the four year period prior to the
filing of this litigation, assert that American Income’s agents are employees, not independent contractors as they are classified by American Income. They allege failure to indemnify and reimburse for business expenses as well as failure to pay
all wages due upon termination in violation of the California Labor Code; failure to pay minimum wages in violation of the California Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Order No. 4-2001, originally and as amended; and unfair business practices in
violation of the California Business and Professions Code §§17200, et seq. They seek, in a jury trial, reimbursement for business expenses and indemnification for losses, payment of minimum wages for their training periods, payment of
moneys due immediately upon termination under the California Labor Code, disgorgement of profits resulting from unfair and unlawful business practices, and injunctive relief granting employee status to all of American Income’s California
agents. On October 29, 2009, American Income filed a motion seeking to remove this litigation from the Superior Court in San Bernadino County to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Eastern Division. The U.S. District
Court remanded the case without prejudice to the Superior Court and denied American Income’s motion to dismiss on December 15, 2009. On January 19, 2010, American Income filed a motion to dismiss which was denied by the Superior Court after a
hearing held on March 16, 2010. On September 20, 2010, American Income again filed a motion to remove the case to federal court based upon jurisdictional grounds that had not been available previously. The Company’s motion was not successful,
however, and the case was remanded back to Superior Court. On January 12, 2011, the Superior Court denied the Company’s motion to exercise the arbitration clauses of those agent contracts that contain them; the Company has appealed that denial.
Discovery is proceeding.

and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Discontinued Operations:

As described in

Note 3—Discontinued Operations

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, we sold our subsidiary United Investors Life Insurance Company (United Investors) as of December 31, 2010. Because of the sale, United
Investors’ financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations are discontinued.

How Torchmark Views Its Operations:

Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market
primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the major insurance product lines of life,
health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.

Insurance Product Line Segments.

As fully
described in

Note 14

—

Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

the product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and benefit administration of policies. Each product line is
further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment
as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:

Premium revenue

Less:

Policy obligations

Policy acquisition costs and commissions

Investment Segment.

The investment segment involves the management of our capital
resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:

Net investment income

Less:

Interest credited to net policy liabilities

Financing costs

See the discussion of

Realized Gains and Losses

in this report.

Torchmark’s operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.

Summary of Operations:

Net
income rose 28% or $112 million in 2010 to $517 million. In 2009, net income declined $47 million or 10% to $405 million from $452 million. On a diluted per share basis, 2010 net income increased 29% to $6.30. In 2009, per share net
income declined 5% to $4.88. Included in 2010 results is the $35 million after tax loss on the disposal of United Investors, representing $.43 per diluted share.

The major contributor to the growth in 2010
earnings compared with the previous two years was in realized investment gains and losses, as 2010 had net gains of $24 million compared with net losses of $85 million in 2009 and $70 million in 2008. The losses in 2009 and 2008 included a number of
writedowns of fixed-maturity securities that were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In 2009, after-tax realized investment losses reduced per share earnings $1.03, of which $1.13 per share related to other-than-temporary impairments
of fixed maturities. In 2008, after-tax losses accounted for $.79 per share, of which $.78 related to fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments. In 2010, we had realized investment gains which added $.30 to per diluted share earnings, even
though there was an other-than-temporary impairment writedown of $.04 per share that offset the net gains for the period. Another important factor in 2010 earnings growth was a $21 million or 8% growth in our excess investment income, the measure of
profitability of our investment segment. In 2009, excess investment income declined $28 million or 9%. Poor economic conditions in 2009, especially early in the year, caused us to hold a significant portion in low-yielding cash and short-term
investments for increased liquidity. Excess investment income was also negatively affected in 2009 because of our issuance of a $300 million 9


/


% debt security in June, 2009 (net proceeds of $296 million) and repayment of a $99 million 8


/


% security which matured in August, 2009. These transactions resulted in a net
increase in our financing costs in 2009 and reduced excess investment income. Results in our core life insurance segment rose 7% in 2010 to $455 million and also increased 3% in 2009, largely as a result of premium growth in both years. The life
segment is our largest contributor to operating results. Earnings from our health operations stabilized in 2010 after two years of declines. This segment has experienced intense competition in recent periods resulting in significant declines in
agent counts, which in turn has resulted in



Index to Financial Statements

lower sales of new health products. Health underwriting margins were flat at $170 million in 2010 after having declined $24 million or 12% in 2009.

Total revenues increased 8% in 2010 to $3.37 billion. In 2009, total
revenues declined 3% to $3.12 billion from $3.20 billion in 2008. Life premium rose 5% or $72 million in 2010 and $48 million in 2009. Net investment income rose $44 million in 2010, compared with $5 million in 2009. However, growth in revenues in
2009 and 2008 were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized investment losses and declines in health premium, described further under this caption.

While life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three
years ending December 31, 2010, margins as a percentage of premium have also held steady each year at 27% of premium. Life net sales rose 1% in 2010 to $330 million and 10% in 2009 to $326 million. Life insurance segment results are discussed
further under the caption

Life

Insurance.

We
market three primary health insurance products: Medicare Supplement insurance, the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, and under-age-65 limited-benefit health insurance. Health premium declined 3% in 2010 to $987 million from
$1.02 billion in 2009. Health premium declined 10% in 2009. The decreases in both years were caused by the decline in agent count and poor persistency. Agent turnover has increased as lower premium, lower margin products offered by competitors
have provided agents with products that are easier to sell. Turnover has also increased due to the Company’s decision to deemphasize the marketing of certain limited-benefit products. Sales of these de-emphasized products were discontinued
altogether after September, 2010. Declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales, which in turn have pressured premium growth. Medicare Supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium, but increased competition
has also dampened sales of this product in recent years, resulting in premium declines in each successive year. Our Medicare Part D premium rose 14% in 2010, after having increased 5% in 2009. However, as most of the country’s Part D
enrollees selected a plan provider in 2006, we do not expect significant growth in our Part D business going forward. See the discussion under

Health Insurance

for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.

We offer fixed annuities, but we do not emphasize sales of annuity
products, favoring life insurance instead. With the sale of United Investors, we disposed of 37% of our annuity deposit balance. See the caption

Annuities

for further discussion of the Annuity segment.

As previously mentioned, the investment segment’s pretax
profitability, or excess investment income, increased $21 million in 2010 but declined $28 million in 2009. Profitability in this segment is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities
(interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. In recent years, growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio. However, in 2010, the growth in net investment income
exceeded the growth in the average portfolio (amortized cost) for the first time in many years, primarily as a result of the special constraints on the growth in net investment income in 2009 noted below. One reason that investment income has grown
at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Also, there is sometimes a lag
between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, in which the funds are held in cash. Growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by Torchmark’s
share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. During 2009, due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets, we held
significantly more cash and short term investments than we normally would. Additionally, in 2009, we sold a significant portion of higher-yielding but lower-rated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in lower-yielding but higher-rated bonds
in 2009 and early 2010 to improve our risk-adjusted return. These factors contributed to reduced 2009 net investment income.

The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with
the insurance policy reserves that are supported by the invested assets. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. In 2010, interest
expense on our long-term debt rose $9 million after increasing $11 million in 2009. As noted earlier during 2009, we issued our $300 million 9


/


% Senior Notes but repaid our $99 million


/


% Senior Debentures, resulting in a higher balance of
debt outstanding at a



Index to Financial Statements

higher interest rate. However, this segment has benefited from lower short-term financing costs in each successive year, as these costs have declined primarily due to lower rates on our
short-term debt.

Torchmark’s current investment policy
limits new investment acquisitions to investment-grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 94% of our invested assets at fair value consists of
fixed maturities of which 93% was investment grade at December 31, 2010. The average quality rating of the portfolio was BBB+. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no direct investment in residential
mortgages, no counterparty risks, no credit default swaps, or derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption

Investments

in this report and

ote

in the

Notes to Consolidated Statements of Operations

for a more detailed discussion of this segment.

As described earlier in this summary, we wrote down certain fixed maturity and equity securities in each of the years 2008 through 2010, as these
securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment. The pretax impairment losses were $5 million, $143 million, and $106 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Please refer to

Note 4—Investments

in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

under the caption

Other-than-temporary impairments

and under the caption

Realized Gains and Losses

in this report for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration
of other-than-temporary impairment. Including the writedowns, we had total after-tax realized investment gains of $24 million in 2010 ($.30 per share), realized investment losses of $85 million in 2009 ($1.03 per share), and
$70 million in 2008 ($.79 per share). Realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income. Under the caption

Realized Gains and Losses

in
this report, we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns. Also, as explained in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, we do not
consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments.

As mentioned earlier, we used a portion of the $296 million proceeds from the offering of our 9


/


% Senior Notes ($300 million par amount) in 2009 to repay our $99 million 8


/


% Senior Debentures which also matured in 2009. In addition, we
also used $175 million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in 2009 in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes. The regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by
rating-agency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios. The subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investment-grade fixed maturities. More information on these transactions can be found in

Note 11—Debt

in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

and in our discussion of

Capital Resources

in this report.

In each of the years 2008 and 2009, income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating
items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. A discussion of these items follows.

As reported in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

in
the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

under the caption

Litigation and Tax Settlements

, we have been involved in certain litigation issues in 2008 and 2009 in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred
settlement losses and expenses. These issues resulted in a net after-tax charge of $770 thousand in 2008. Additionally, as described under the same caption of Note 1, we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of $2.9 million in
2009 and $10.8 million in 2008. All of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations. Legal and litigation expenses pertaining to current
operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses, as appropriate, in our segment analysis. Income from litigation settlements is included in other income. As explained in

Note 4—Investments

under the
caption

Other-than-temporary impairments

, we wrote down certain company-occupied property to fair value during both 2009 and 2008. The write downs resulted in after-tax charges of $231 thousand in 2009 and $1.4 million in 2008.

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began
in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Company’s excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these



Index to Financial Statements

purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to
repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. Due to economic conditions in late 2008 and early 2009, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009.
However, in the first quarter of 2010, the Board of Directors reactivated the Company’s previously suspended share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best
interest of the Company. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010.

Analysis of Share Purchases

(Amounts in thousands)

Throughout the remainder of this
discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.

A discussion of each of Torchmark’s segments follows.

Life Insurance.

Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2010 life premium representing 63% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and
administrative expense represented 73% of the total in 2010. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.

We have been in the process of combining selected United American (UA)
Exclusive Agency Branch Offices with the Liberty National Exclusive Agency. For this reason, all data will be reported on a combined basis in this report.

Life insurance premium rose 5% to $1.66 billion in 2010 after having increased 3% in 2009 to $1.59 billion. Life insurance products are marketed
through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:

LIFE INSURANCE

Premium by
Distribution Method

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

We use three statistical measures as
indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: “annualized premium in force,” “net sales,” and “first-year collected premium.” Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be
received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is



Index to Financial Statements

annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full
premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected
during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is
expected to be added to premium income in the future.

Annualized life premium in force was $1.75 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of 3% over $1.69 billion a year earlier. Annualized life
premium in force was $1.63 billion at December 31, 2008.

The following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method.

Direct Response

consists of two
primary components: direct mail and insert media. Direct mail targets primarily young middle-income households with children. The juvenile life insurance policy is a key product. Not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales, but it
also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders. Parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves
than is the general adult population. Also, both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time. At this time, we believe that the Direct Response unit is the largest U.S.
writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance. We expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of Direct Response’s premier markets.

The insert media area targets primarily the adult market. It involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of
media, such as coupon packets, newspapers, bank statements, and billings.



Index to Financial Statements

The Direct Response operation accounted for 34% of our life insurance premium during 2010, the largest
of any distribution group. Life premium for this channel rose 6% in 2010 and 5% in 2009. Net sales rose 4% in 2010 to $137 million after a 7% gain in 2009 to $132 million. First-year collected premium increased 6% in 2010 to $90 million after a 6%
gain in 2009.

The

American Income Exclusive Agency

focuses primarily on members of labor unions, but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales. It is Torchmark’s highest profit margin business. Life premium for this agency rose 10% to $560 million in 2010,
after having increased 7% in 2009. Net sales increased 8% in 2010 to $138 million from $128 million in 2009, as this agency was Torchmark’s largest contributor to life net sales in 2010. Net sales rose 18% in 2009. First-year collected
premium rose 16% in 2010 to $111 million, after having increased 17% in 2009. As in the case of all of Torchmark’s agency distribution systems, continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count. The
American Income agent count was 3,912 at December 31, 2010 compared with 4,154 a year earlier, a decline of 6%. However, the agent count rose 35% in 2009 from 3,085 at year end 2008, after having risen 21% in 2008. This agency continues to recruit
new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business. Additionally, the systematic, centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents.

As previously mentioned, we have combined selected

UA
Exclusive Agency Branch Offices

into the

Liberty National Exclusive Agency

. This Agency markets primarily low-face amount life insurance and supplemental health insurance to middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was
$295 million in 2010, a 1% decrease compared with $298 million in 2009. Life premium for this agency declined 2% in 2009 from 2008. First-year collected premium on a combined basis declined 1% to $35 million in 2010, after having increased 6%
in 2009.

The Liberty Agency’s net sales declined 19%
to $45 million in 2010, after having increased 1% a year earlier. This agency had 2,001 producing agents at December 31, 2010, compared with 2,471 a year earlier, a decline of 19%. The agent count at Liberty had also declined 51% in 2009 from
5,020. The decrease in agent count has been due in part to the closing of several offices which have had low production. In addition, agent compensation issues that arose in 2009 have negatively impacted agent counts. A two-tier bonus threshold
proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated. Management reverted to a level bonus threshold later in 2009. Also, due to deteriorating first-year persistency on business written during 2008 and early 2009, management modified
compensation incentives in 2009 to place more emphasis on the persistency of newly issued policies. This resulted in the departure of a number of the less productive agents but improved first year persistency.

The Liberty Exclusive Agency agent counts have also decreased due to
issues related to its health insurance business. Until recently, the agency’s health insurance marketing efforts had been focused on limited-benefit hospital-surgical plans. These plans were subject to intense competition which ultimately
resulted in decreases in agent counts. In addition, these limited-benefit hospital-surgical plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments. Sales of these limited-benefit hospital/surgical plans were discontinued after September,
2010. In response, the agency has shifted its marketing focus to a product mix more weighted towards life insurance and supplemental health insurance products (not affected by healthcare reform) that have higher margins and persistency. We believe
this will increase the Agency’s profitability and stability in the long run.

We also offer life insurance through

Other Agencies

consisting of the Military Agency, the United American Independent Agency, and other small miscellaneous sales agencies. The Military Agency consists of a
nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life
products with term insurance riders. Military premium represented 12% of life premium. The United American Independent Agency represented less than 2% of Torchmark’s total life premium. This agency is focused on health insurance, with life
sales being incidental.

Summary of Results

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Gross margins, as indicated by insurance
underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 7% in 2010 to $455 million after rising 3% in 2009. As a percentage of life insurance premium, gross margins have been stable each year at 27%. Margin growth in all periods was
primarily the result of premium growth.

Health
Insurance.

Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement and Part D prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal Medicare program, cancer coverage, and accident coverage. All health
coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement and Part D are classified here as limited-benefit plans. For several years, our primary health insurance product had been hospital/surgical plans. However, as previously mentioned, these plans became
subject to intense competition which resulted in decreasing agent counts. In addition, these plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments. These factors contributed to the Company’s decisions to de-emphasize and
discontinue the marketing of these products. In 2010, Medicare Supplement sales exceeded those of the limited-benefit products for the first time since 2001, and represented 56% of health net sales exclusive of Medicare Part D. Medicare Supplement
sales have been stronger than limited-benefit sales due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below.



Index to Financial Statements

Total health premium represented 37% of Torchmark’s total premium income in 2010. Excluding Part
D premium, health premium represented 32% in 2010, compared with 34% in 2009 and 38% in 2008. Health underwriting margin, excluding Part D, accounted for 24% of the total in 2010, compared with 26% in 2009 and 29% in 2008. These declines in the
health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment. As mentioned previously, health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent
periods. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.

we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.

Medicare Part D.

As noted under the caption

Life Insurance

, we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to life’s superior margins and other benefits. Our health distribution groups have also encountered increased
competition in recent periods. The increased competition has led to losses in agents in our Liberty Exclusive Agency and Independent Agencies. Agent turnover has increased as lower premium, lower margin products offered by competitors have provided
agents with products that are easier to sell. Turnover has also increased due to the Company’s decision to deemphasize the marketing of certain limited-benefit products as previously discussed. The marketing of these products was discontinued
altogether after September, 2010. Declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales, which in turn have pressured premium growth. Health premium, excluding Part D premium, fell 7% to $779 million in 2010, after declining 12% in 2009.
Medicare Supplement premium declined 1% to $452 million in 2010, compared with a 6% decline in 2009. Other limited-benefit health premium dropped 14% in 2010 to $327 million, after a decline of 18% in 2009 and 9% in 2008. Net sales, excluding
Medicare Part D, declined 33% to $64 million in 2010. Net sales fell 30% in 2009 to $97 million. Medicare Supplement net sales fell 21% in 2010, but rose 64% in 2009. Other health net sales continued to decline, falling 45% in 2010 and 54% in 2009.
First year collected premium also declined in both 2010 and 2009.



Index to Financial Statements

Medicare Supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium, partially because Medicare
Supplement products are generally more persistent than the limited-benefit products, but also because of more stable sales in recent periods. Medicare Supplement premium represented 58% of non-Part D health premium in 2010, compared with 55% in 2009
and 51% in 2008.

The

Liberty National Exclusive
Agency

is Torchmark’s largest in terms of health premium income. In 2010, this Agency represented 43% of all Torchmark non-Part D income health premium at $331 million. The Liberty Agency markets Medicare Supplements and limited-benefit
health products including cancer insurance. In 2010, health premium income in this Agency declined 15% from prior year premium of $389 million. Premium also fell 18% in 2009 from $476 million. First-year collected premium declined 52% to $16 million
in 2010, after declining 62% a year earlier. As noted earlier, increased competition in the health insurance market and our de-emphasis of certain health products has caused declines in agent counts. Marketing of the de-emphasized products was
discontinued altogether after September, 2010. The decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales, translating into declines in premium. Net sales for 2010 declined 52% from $30 million in 2009 to $14 million. In 2009, this
Agency’s net sales fell 64%. Also discussed under the

Life Insurance

caption are efforts designed to strengthen this Agency.

The UA Independent Agency

is composed of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark whose size range from very large, multi-state
organizations down to one-person offices. All of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies. Torchmark had 1,406 active producing agents at December 31, 2010. This agency is our largest distributor of non-Part D health insurance
in terms of health net sales, representing 50% in 2010. This agency is also our largest carrier of Medicare Supplement insurance, with $267 million or 59% of our Medicare Supplement premium income in 2010. Net sales for this Agency dropped 25% to
$32 million in 2010, after having gained 14% to $43 million in 2009. Medicare Supplement net sales of $27 million declined 10% from $30 million a year earlier. Medicare Supplement net sales had more than doubled in 2009 over net sales of $15 million
in 2008. The increases in 2009 were due to increases in group Medicare Supplement sales. Group Medicare Supplement sales fluctuate greatly from period to period and do not indicate a trend. Total health premium income for the UA Independent Agency
was $315 million in 2010, a 4% decline from 2009 premium of $326 million. Premium income also declined 9% in 2009 from 2008. These declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses.

The American Income Exclusive Agency,

predominantly a life
insurance distribution channel, is our third largest health insurance distributor based on 2010 premium collected. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans. Approximately 70% of the agency’s 2010 health premium was from
accident policies. Sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.

Health premium at this agency rose 5% in 2010 to $79 million, after having increased 2% to $75 million in 2009. Net health sales were $13 million in
both 2010 and 2009, compared with $12 million in 2008. Net health sales comprised 9% of the American Income Agency’s total net sales in 2010.

Direct Response

, primarily a life operation, also offers health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to
employer or union sponsored groups. In 2010, net health sales were $5 million, comprising approximately 4% of Direct Response’s total life and health net sales. Direct Response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year.
Health premium rose 17% in 2010 to $54 million and 3% in 2009.

Medicare Part D.

Torchmark, through its subsidiary United American, offers coverage under the government’s Medicare Part D plan. The Medicare Part D plan is a
stand-alone prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Part D is regulated and partially funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for participating private insurers like United American, unlike the traditional Medicare
program for hospital and doctor services, where CMS is the primary insurer and private Medicare Supplement insurers are secondary insurers. The program generally calls for CMS to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured Medicare
beneficiary paying one third of the premium. Total Medicare Part D premium was $209 million in 2010, compared with $184 million in 2009, an increase of 14%. Part D premium rose 5% in 2009. Changes in Part D premium generally result from changes in
the



Index to Financial Statements

number of enrollees. Enrollment for all Part D coverages ends on December 31 of the previous year, except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year. At December 31, 2010, United American
had approximately 144 thousand enrollees for the 2011 Part D plan, compared with 158 thousand for the 2010 plan year and 147 thousand for the 2009 plan year. Our Medicare Part D product is sold primarily through the Direct Response operation, but is
also sold to groups through the UA Independent agency. Part D net sales were $39 million in 2010, compared with $43 million in 2009 and $28 million in 2008. We count only sales to new first-time enrollees in net sales, and the majority of premium
income was from previous enrollees.

We believe that the
Medicare Part D program is a meaningful component of our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior-age market and with Medicare Supplements, the government assurances with regard to the risk-sharing agreements for
participating insurers, the incremental income added to our health insurance margins, and the renewal of the business every year. Due to our experience with service to the senior-age market and the use of our existing Direct Response marketing
system, entry to this business required little new investment. However, we do not expect significant growth in the Part D product in the near future, as most Medicare beneficiaries have already chosen a plan. Additionally, as with any
government-sponsored program, the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market.

Torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense
declined 12% in 2009 to $170 million but stabilized in 2010, remaining flat at $170 million. As a percentage of premium income, margins were stable in all periods at approximately 17%.

Annuities.

As described in

Note 3—Discontinued Operations

, we sold our
subsidiary United Investors. United Investors was our carrier of variable annuities and a primary carrier of fixed annuities. As a result of the sale, we disposed of approximately 37% of our annuity deposit balance as of December 31, 2010,
including all variable annuities. These balances have been reported as “Held for Sale” on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets

of prior periods. Accordingly, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business
or marketing strategy going forward.

Our fixed annuity
balances at the end of 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $1.24 billion, $959 million, and $817 million, respectively.

An analysis of underwriting income is as follows.

ANNUITIES

Summary of
Results

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

*

A significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements. This spread sometimes results in
negative net policy obligations.

While the
fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year, policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly. The stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges
and are not based on account size. These charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which
can result in negative net policy obligations. In both 2010 and 2009, the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities. Furthermore, spreads were increased by the
introduction of a new annuity form on Liberty National paper in mid-2009. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits.

Administrative expenses.

Operating expenses are included in the Other
and Corporate Segments and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2010.

Operating Expenses Selected Information

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Insurance administrative
expenses rose 4% in 2010, after having declined 4% in 2009. As a percentage of premium, they increased to 5.9% in 2010 from 5.8% in both 2009 and 2008. The 2010 increase was caused primarily by higher employee costs, mostly related to higher
employee health benefit costs. Partially offsetting the increase in employee costs was a decline in legal costs, as we favorably settled certain previously reserved litigation during 2010. In 2009, increases in salaries were more than offset by
declines in other administrative costs and other employee costs. As a result of the effort to achieve greater consistency in expense classification among our subsidiaries, we deferred $12 million more of deferrable administrative expense to
acquisition expense in 2009 compared with 2008. These reductions in administrative expense were partially offset by increases in pension and other employee benefit costs during the period.



Index to Financial Statements

As mentioned in Note 1—

Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

, we settled litigation for $2.5 million in 2008 relating to issues occurring many years ago. As previously noted, we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to
current insurance operations. Stock compensation expense declined in 2009, primarily as a result of the lower stock price caused by the severe market decline in 2009 and the effect it had on values at the time of our annual stock and stock option
grants for 2009. Expense related to the new 2009 grants replaced the expense for costlier older grants that became fully vested. Stock compensation expense rose in 2010 as market conditions improved, resulting in higher values for stock and option
grants in 2010. Management believes that stock compensation expense will increase slightly in 2011. As stated in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

, management views stock compensation
expense as a corporate expense, and therefore treats it as a Parent Company expense. As described in

Note 4—Investments

under the caption

Other-than-temporary impairments

, we wrote down certain Company-occupied real estate because
it met our criteria as described in that note for other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, we incurred a pretax charge of $2.1 million in 2008 and $355 thousand in 2009 which are included in

in the respective year.

Investments.

We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment
segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in

Note 14—

Business Segments

in
the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

It is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs.” We also
view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding,
representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used over $4.2 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after
determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing
assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

Excess investment income increased $21 million or 8% in 2010 over the prior year. Excess investment income declined $28
million or 9% in 2009. On a per diluted share basis, excess investment income rose 9% to $3.62 per share in 2010, after having declined 3% in the prior year. Share purchases caused the 2010 increase in per share excess investment income to be
greater than the dollar amount of increase. Likewise, those purchases also caused the decline in per share excess investment income in 2009 to be less than the decline in the dollar amount.

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose

8% to $685 million in 2010.
It increased 1% to $632 million in 2009 from $627 million in 2008. Presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets.

In 2010, the growth in net investment income exceeded the growth in mean invested assets (at amortized cost) for the first time in many years. One of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower
rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Another factor that has contributed to the
relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested. During these lags, we have held cash at lower yields. One of the
most important factors contributing to the low growth rate in investment income during 2009 is the fact that, due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets, we held significantly more cash and short term investments during
2009 than we did during 2010 and 2008. Had we not done so, and if short term investment rates had not been much lower during 2009 than in 2008, the growth rate in investment income during 2009 would have been approximately the same as the growth
rate in mean assets.



Index to Financial Statements

Excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the
interest paid on corporate debt. Information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table.

Interest Credited to Net Insurance Policy Liabilities

(Dollar amounts in millions)

The average interest crediting
rate has risen in each of the last three years. In 2001, as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions, we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points (1%) on policies issued after January 1, 2001. As this group of policies
becomes a larger proportion of our business, the average crediting rate will continue to increase. For more specific information on life and health crediting rates, please refer to

Excess investment
income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below reconciles interest expense per the

The table below presents the components of financing costs.

Analysis of Financing Costs

(Amounts in thousands)

Financing costs increased $6 million or 8%
in 2010. They rose $7 million or 11% in 2009. The increases in financing costs in both years reflect the issuance in June 2009 of $300 million principal amount 9 ¼% Senior Notes due in 2019. In 2010, we incurred a full year of interest on this
issue. The increase in 2009 was partially offset by the maturity in August 2009 of $99 million principal amount 8 ¼% Senior Debentures. Short-term interest expense has trended downward over the past three years, decreasing $3 million in 2010
after having declined $4 million in 2009. These declines have resulted from significantly lower interest rates when compared with the respective prior year. The 2010 decrease was also impacted by a 22% decline in the average balance of commercial
paper outstanding compared with 2009.

Excess investment
income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is
significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates.

Investment Acquisitions

.    Torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment-grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities (maturity
date more than 20 years after acquisition date) that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We
believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If such longer-term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives, we consider investing in short-term securities, taking
into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time. During calendar years 2008 through 2010, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities.



Index to Financial Statements

The following table summarizes selected information for fixed-maturity purchases. The effective annual
yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield. This date is commonly known as the “worst call date.” Two different average life calculations are shown, average life to the
next call date and average life to the maturity date.

Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information

(Dollar amounts in millions)

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some
funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not (and if so, when) the issuer calls the investment prior
to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment. However, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not
exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart. The average life of funds invested in 2009 (to both next call and maturity) was lower than that of funds invested during 2008 and 2010
due to actions taken for statutory capital management purposes and the limited availability of longer term investments.

During the three years 2008 through 2010, we have invested primarily in investment-grade corporate bonds. During 2008, we invested a considerable
amount of the funds in trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with longer scheduled maturity dates, often exceeding 30 years. In virtually all cases, such securities are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date.
During 2009 and 2010, we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds, primarily Build America Bonds authorized by the American Recovery and Retirement Act of 2009. In assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds, we took into account
the geographic location of the municipalities. The investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services.

New cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the low-interest
environment experienced during the past three years, although this effect has diminished each successive year. Issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost. Calls increase funds
available for investment, but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $109 million in 2010,
$181 million in 2009, and $238 million in 2008. The higher level of acquisitions in 2009 was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below.

Sales transactions.

As disclosed in

Note 4—Investments

, the
Company sold $703 million of fixed maturities at amortized cost in the third quarter of 2009, including $293 million of below- investment-grade securities. The market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a
level where, even though the sales price was less than amortized cost, management determined that better risk-adjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities. Other securities were sold at prices that
produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes. Due in large part to selling below-investment-grade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investment-grade securities, below-investment-grade securities as a percentage of total fixed
maturities at amortized cost declined from 15% at June 30, 2009 to 9% at December 31, 2009. The reduction in below-investment-grade securities had a positive impact on the risk-based capital position of our insurance subsidiaries.

Portfolio Analysis.

Because Torchmark has
recently invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmark’s components of
invested assets at amortized cost as of December 31, 2010 with the latest industry data.

At December 31, 2010, approximately 94% of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixed-maturity
portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, made up an additional 3%. The remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities, mortgage loans, and other long-term and short-term investments.



Index to Financial Statements

Because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the
remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities. An analysis of our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 is as follows:

Fixed Maturities by Component

At December 31, 2010

(Dollar amounts in millions)

Fixed Maturities by Component

At December 31, 2009

(Dollar amounts in millions)



Index to Financial Statements

At December 31, 2010, fixed maturities had a fair value of $10.5 billion, compared with $9.1 billion
at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, fixed maturities were in a $108 million net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized loss position of $455 million at December 31, 2009. Approximately 74% of our fixed maturity assets at
December 31, 2010 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 13% were redeemable preferred stocks. This compares with 73% corporate bonds and 14% redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2009. At December 31, 2010, less than 2% of the assets at
amortized cost were residential mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The $57 million of CDOs at amortized cost made up less than 1% of the assets and are backed primarily by trust
preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. The $16 million of mortgage-backed securities are rated AAA. For more information about our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2010 and 2009, including an analysis

Credit Risk Sensitivity.

Credit risk is the level of certainty that a
security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. Approximately 87% of our fixed-maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities (including redeemable preferred and asset-backed
securities). As we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, credit risk is a concern. We mitigate this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring investment-grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each
prospective issuer. We continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. We also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors.

The following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed
maturities by industry sector at December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, approximately
35% of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost (34% at fair value) were in the financial sector, including 16% in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 14% in banks at amortized cost. Financial guarantors, mortgage
insurers, and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5% of the portfolio. After financials, the next largest sector was utilities, which comprised 15% of the portfolio at amortized cost. The balance of the portfolio is spread among 268 issuers in
a wide variety of sectors. As previously noted, gross unrealized losses were $368 million at December 31, 2010, declining from $699 million a year earlier. As shown in the chart above, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position at December
31, 2010, compared with a net unrealized loss position at the prior year end. Approximately 60% of the change in the fair value relative to amortized cost in 2010 was attributable to improvements in the financial sectors, while the remaining 40% was
in the non-financial sectors. As discussed in

Note


—Investments

, we believe much of the unrealized losses experienced in 2008 and 2009 were attributable to illiquidity in the financial markets. We expect to recover the
full book value of our investments in impaired securities.

As shown in the table above, the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was greater than 45% for our investments in CDOs and the financial
guarantor sector. We evaluated each of the impaired securities in these and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of the impairments were other-than-temporary. Certain information about our evaluation of the impaired securities in the
CDO and monoline insurer sectors is provided in the following paragraphs.



Index to Financial Statements

At December 31, 2010, we held investments in five different CDOs. In our opinion, our investments in
four of these CDOs were other-than-temporarily impaired. Three of these CDOs have been written down to a carrying value of zero. The fourth is carried at a value of $34 million, less than the present value of discounted future cash flows at original
purchase yield but greater than its fair value of $17 million. The fifth CDO ($22 million amortized cost and $6 million fair value) we believe was not other-than-temporarily impaired. At December 31, 2009, the four CDOs that were
other-than-temporarily impaired had an amortized cost of $34 million ($13 million fair value). The CDO that was not other-than-temporarily impaired had an amortized cost of $21 million ($5 million fair value). In reaching these conclusions
concerning other-than-temporary impairment, we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers of each of these CDOs the current status of the collateral underlying our investments, the credit events (defaults and deferrals in underlying
collateral) experienced to date, and the possibility of future credit events. We calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience. We
reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events would have on our expected future cash flows. We calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without
negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate. While there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations, we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions.

Also at December 31, 2009, we held investments issued by five different
monoline insurers. In our opinion, our investments in three of these monoline insurers ($9 million amortized cost and $10 million fair value) were other-than-temporarily impaired. These securities were sold in 2010 for $12 million for a realized
gain of $3 million. Our investments in the other two monoline insurers ($83 million amortized cost and $37 million fair value at December 31, 2009) were not believed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. At December 31, 2010, these two investments
were carried at an amortized cost of $84 million (fair value $56 million). We collected and analyzed a significant amount of information to form opinions about the reasons for the severity of our impairments, including the illiquidity of some of our
holdings (and its impact on fair values), the expected future experience in the mortgage market, and the reasonable expectation of the receipt of all future contractual interest and principal payments for these investments. We reviewed news and
information about the economy and the mortgage market in general and about the issuers of our investments. We reviewed and analyzed financial statements and had discussions with sell-side and independent credit analysts who follow this sector,
certain regulators, and members of the management teams of some of the issuers of our investments. While there is a possibility that future experience in the mortgage markets will differ from our current expectations, we believe there is ample
evidence to support our conclusions.

An analysis of the fixed-maturity portfolio by a composite rating at December 31, 2010 is shown
in the table below.

Fixed Maturities by Rating

At December 31, 2010

(Dollar amounts in millions)

The portfolio has a weighted average
quality rating of BBB+ based on amortized cost. Approximately

92% of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some
of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not
participate in securities lending. There are no off-balance sheet investments, as all investments are reported on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. At December 31, 2010, we had $22 million at fair value ($

57 million book value)
invested in CDOs, for which the composite rating at that date was C+. The collateral underlying these CDOs is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies, and no sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages are included in the
collateral.

Our current investment policy is to acquire
only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.



Index to Financial Statements

Market Risk Sensitivity.

Torchmark’s financial securities are
exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio. Since 94% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed-maturity
investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book
value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment
strategy to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease
in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, in accordance with GAAP, these liabilities are not marked to market.

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity
of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The
data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.

Realized Gains and Losses.

Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income
from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a
part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a
part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities
are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.

Because our investment portfolio is large and diverse, investments are
occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses
are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only
secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations
caused by gains and losses can cause the period-to-period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance
operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

under the caption

Other-than temporary impairments

in the

we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2008 through 2010 as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as
discussed in

Note 4

and in our

in this report. The writedowns resulted in pretax charges of $5 million in 2010 ($3 million after tax), $143 million in 2009 ($94 million after tax), and $106 million
in 2008 ($69 million after tax). The 2009 charge included $83 million on CDOs ($55 million after tax) and $24 million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers ($16 million after tax). The remaining writedowns in 2009 were
from losses on a variety of corporate bonds. In 2008, the significant bonds written down were Lehman Brothers bonds of $74 million pretax ($48 million after tax) and Washington Mutual bonds of $19 million pretax ($12 million after tax). Other
writedowns in 2008 included perpetual preferred stocks of Federal National Mortgage Association and certain non-financial securities.

Additionally, as described in

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity.

Liquidity provides Torchmark
with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities,
and a line of credit facility.

The operations of our
insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include
policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes.

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity.

The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash
flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the
majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of
cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’
prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis.

Parent Company Liquidity

.

Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay Parent Company dividends
on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, and operating expenses of the Parent. In 2010, the Parent received $401 million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries, as compared with
$392 million in 2009 and $437 million in 2008. After paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in 2010 of approximately $269 million.
Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In 2011, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive $742 million in
dividends from subsidiaries, including approximately $305 million of the proceeds from the sale of United Investors, and that approximately $655 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these
dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of

Note 12

—

Shareholders’ Equity

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Although
these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company. As additional liquidity, the Parent held $63 million of cash and short-term investments at December 31,
2010, compared with $155 million a year earlier. The Parent also had available a $138 million receivable from subsidiaries at December 31, 2010.

Short-Term Borrowings.

An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows
unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. As described in the

Commercial Paper

section of

Note 11—Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

, this facility was entered into on
December 10, 2010 and replaced an earlier $600 million facility which would have expired in August, 2011. As of December 31, 2010, we had available $203 million under this facility. For detailed information about this new line of credit
facility, see the

Commercial Paper

section of

Note 11

—Debt.



Index to Financial Statements

The following table presents certain information about our short-term borrowings, all of which was
commercial paper during the two years ending December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

Short-term Borrowings—Commercial Paper

(Dollar amounts in millions)

*

Annualized

There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009.

In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2011
and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company
could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, a short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.

Consolidated Liquidity

.

Consolidated net cash inflows
provided from operations were $1.03 billion in 2010, compared with $976 million in 2009, and $731 million in 2008. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies have received $321 million in investment calls and tenders and
$318 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2010. Maturities, tenders, and calls totaled $761 million in 2009 and $581 million in 2008.

Our cash and short-term investments were $582 million at year-end 2010 and $529 million at year-end 2009. Included in cash at December 31, 2010
was the $343 million of proceeds received from the sale of United Investors on that date. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities
had a fair value of $10.5 billion at December 31, 2010. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

As fully
described and discussed in

Note 11

—

Debt

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

and under the subcaption

Funded Debt,

Torchmark had outstanding $120 million (par amount) 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities
at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders. The trust is an off-balance sheet arrangement
which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with GAAP rules. Deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest. Therefore Torchmark is not the primary
beneficiary of the entity, even though we own all of the entity’s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity’s performance. While these liabilities are not on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

, they are represented by
Torchmark’s 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust. These Junior Subordinated Debentures were a Torchmark liability of $124 million par and book value at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. These securities are indicated as a
capital resource to us under the caption

Capital

Resources

in this report. The 7.1% preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 7.1% interest payment on our debt to the trusts. As described in

Note 15

Commitments and Contingencies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements,

we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the Trust Preferred
shareholders.



Index to Financial Statements

As a part of its above-mentioned credit facility, Torchmark has outstanding $198 million in stand-by
letters of credit. However, these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole.

As of December 31, 2010, we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third-party entities
other than as described above. All of our guarantees, other than the Trust Preferred guarantee, were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in

Funded debt is itemized in

and includes short-term commercial paper.

(2)

Interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.

(3)

Pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans. They are offset by invested assets in the
trusts, which are funded through periodic contributions by Torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due. Therefore, our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on Torchmark’s

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. At December 31, 2010, these pension obligations were $286 million, but there were also assets of $237 million in the pension entities. The schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is
based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations, except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted. Please refer to

Uncertain tax positions do not include $40 thousand of accrued interest. See

Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at December 31, 2010. These estimated payments were
computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $9.2
billion at December 31, 2010, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.

Capital Resources.

Torchmark’s capital structure consists of
short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in

Note 11

—

Debt

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements),

long-term funded debt, Junior Subordinated Debentures supporting its Trust Preferred Securities,
and shareholders’ equity. The Junior Subordinated Debentures are payable to Torchmark’s Capital Trust III which is liable for its Trust Preferred Securities. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are included in “Due to
affiliates” on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in

Note 11—Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The carrying value of the funded debt was
$

913 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $920 million a year earlier.

As fully explained in

Note 11—Debt

, we issued $300 million principal amount of 9¼% Senior Notes due in 2019 in June of 2009 for
proceeds of $296 million. A portion of these proceeds were used to repay the $99 million due upon the August, 2009 maturity of our 8¼% Senior Debentures. Of the $197 million balance of the proceeds, $175 million was contributed as capital to
our insurance subsidiaries in 2009. The subsidiaries then in turn invested these funds in investment-grade corporate bonds and municipal bonds. The capital contributions were made as a result of our desire to maintain subsidiary regulatory capital
at levels adequate to meet the requirements of rating agencies.

Poor economic conditions experienced during 2009 caused the ratings of many bonds in our insurance subsidiaries’ portfolios to be downgraded and also resulted in increased other-than-temporary impairments
taken. This large volume of ratings downgrades and impairments in 2009 had a significant negative effect on the subsidiaries’ regulatory capital. Our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325% of required
regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows,
the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark. RBC was favorably impacted in 2009 by these capital contributions and the sales of below-investment-grade securities
discussed under the caption

Investments—Sales Transactions

in this report. Improvements in financial markets in 2010 which resulted in rating upgrades in the bond portfolios further strengthened the capital position of our insurance
subsidiaries in 2010. At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had RBC ratios in excess of 350%. Should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future and the ratio falls below 325%,
management has available cash on hand and a credit line at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325%.

As noted under the caption

Highlights

in this report, we
reactivated our share repurchase program during the first quarter of 2010. We previously had suspended the program indefinitely in March, 2009 due to general economic conditions at that time. Under this program, we acquired 4 million shares at
a cost of $204 million in 2010 (average of $53.51 million per share), 2 million shares for $47 million in 2009, and 8 million shares for $427 million in 2008. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year. Please refer to the

Torchmark has recently increased the dividend on its common shares. In the first quarter of 2010, the dividend was increased from $.14 per share to $.15 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2010, it was
further increased to $.16 per share.

Shareholders’
equity was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009. During the twelve months since December 31, 2009, shareholders’ equity was reduced by the $204 million in share purchases but has been increased
by after tax unrealized gains of $345 million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved. As explained in

2009 resulted primarily from illiquidity in the financial markets as a result of general economic conditions.

We plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so. Excess cash flow could be used for share
repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies.



Index to Financial Statements

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support our insurance
policyholders’ liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred
acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued,
accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities
in relation to our shareholders’ equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on
equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders’ equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if
interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. Recently, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio had been depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity resulting in a significant decrease in shareholders’
equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur
losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial
statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.

The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance
on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmark’s capital structure.

***

Torchmark’s debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing total
debt by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity.

Effective in 2008, the FASB issued new guidance, offering an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our

Consolidated Balance
Sheets

. However, unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because both the
size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results.
Therefore, we have not elected this option.



Index to Financial Statements

The fixed maturity portfolio contained $1.8 billion in net unrealized investment losses at year
end 2008 ($1.1 billion after tax and the associated adjustment to deferred acquisition costs) including fixed maturities in the subsidiary sold in 2010. These unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening
credit spreads in financial markets, and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders’ equity in 2008. In 2009, as conditions in financial markets began to improve, unrealized losses declined $1.3 billion ($.9 billion after
tax). As financial markets continued to improve in 2010, the $456 million of unrealized losses at year end 2009 in the fixed maturity portfolio turned into $107 million of unrealized gains, a positive change of $531 million after taking into account
the adjustment of $32 million to deferred acquisition costs ($345 million after tax). Torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 11.3 times in 2010, compared with 9.3 times
in 2009 and

10.9 times in 2008. This times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the
discussion of financing costs under the caption

During the three year period ended December 31, 2010, each of the rating agencies revised the outlook for Torchmark from stable to negative and then back to stable. Reasons cited for the negative outlook included
increased risk in our investment portfolio, tighter liquidity, and reduced financial flexibility. Reasons cited for the revision back to a stable outlook included improved financial flexibility, increased capital levels at the insurance
subsidiaries, the decrease in unrealized losses, and strong operating performance.

The credit quality of Torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies. During 2009, A. M. Best downgraded our preferred stock from bbb+ to bbb. Also in 2009, Fitch
downgraded our Senior Debt from A to BBB+ (two notches), our preferred stock from A- to BBB (two notches), and our commercial paper from F1 to F2 (one notch). Fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital
position of Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries’ investment portfolios. They also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the
Parent Company from the subsidiaries, the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil, and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward. In January, 2010, Fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to BBB-. At
that time, Fitch downgraded over 200 hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities, as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed.

The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is also rated by Standard & Poor’s and A. M. Best. The following chart
presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2010.

A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+
(Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. The A.M. Best A (Excellent) rating is assigned to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated excellent overall
performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A (Excellent) companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time.



Index to Financial Statements

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poor’s Corporation to
those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. The minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category. The A rating is assigned to an insurer with
strong financial security characteristics, somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings.

OTHER ITEMS

Litigation.

Torchmark and its
subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims that are
tried in Alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in Alabama are based upon the compensatory damages (including mental anguish) awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory
damages is not precisely defined. Additionally, it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the State of Mississippi, a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts. This bespeaks caution
since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to
Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to

NEW UNADOPTED ACCOUNTING RULES

The FASB has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to Torchmark, effective in future periods:

Policy

Acquisition Costs

:    This new
accounting guidance amends the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in order to address the diversity in practice surrounding the capitalization and deferral of these costs. This guidance will be effective
for Torchmark beginning January 1, 2012, with early adoption permitted. Prospective or retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance. At this time we expect its adoption to reduce our shareholders’ equity
approximately 8% at the time of adoption. We intend to adopt this guidance retrospectively. Because both the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs will be lower in future periods, and those effects are largely offsetting, we do not expect
that there will be a material impact on operating results going forward.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Future Policy Benefits.

Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our
insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for
determining this liability are disclosed in

Note 1

—

Significant

Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

A list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future
policy benefits is reported in

Note 6

—

Future Policy Benefit Reserves

.

Approximately 78% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2010 were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the
present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are “locked
in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements

under the
caption

Future Policy Benefits.

Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. A premium deficiency event for Torchmark’s
traditional business is very rare, and did not occur during the three years ended December 31, 2010.

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, whereby the recorded
liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit
business.

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of
Insurance Purchased.

The costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance
sales. Additionally, the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “Value of Insurance Purchased” as indicated in

Note 5

—

Deferred

Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are
reported in

Note 1

—

Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Approximately 97% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2010 were related to traditional products and are being
amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are
“locked-in” at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability
in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2010.

The remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are
amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that
earlier estimates should be revised. As noted earlier in this report, our variable annuity block was disposed of as of December 31, 2010. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of
deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2010.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable.

This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The
estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors
involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of



Index to Financial Statements

policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are
reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the
circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our
historical experience.

Valuation of Fixed
Maturities.

We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected
to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we
would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities.
Because of the size of our fixed-maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption

Market Risk

Sensitivity

in this report. However, as discussed under the caption

Financial Condition

in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition
and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.

During recent periods, the values of our fixed maturities were also affected by illiquidity in the financial markets, which contributed to a spread
widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result
of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is
presented in

Note 4—Investments

under the caption

Fair Value Measurements

.

Impairment of Investments.

We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value, where fair value has declined below carrying value. While
the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than
temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in

Note 1

Significant Accounting Policies

and

Note 4

Investments

in the

Notes
to

Consolidated

Financial Statements

and the discussions under the captions

Investments

and

Realized Gains and

Losses

in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value
with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.

Defined benefit pension plans.

We
maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on
specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These
obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2010, our net liability under these plans was $286 million.

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for
pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the
pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions
may cause material differences in reported results for these plans. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and
other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. Our discount rate, rate of



Index to Financial Statements

return on assets, and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in

Note 10

—

Postretirement Benefits

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. Note 10 also contains information about pension plan assets, investment
policies, and other related data.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

We caution readers regarding certain forward-looking
statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this document, and in any other statements made by us or on our behalf whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any statement that is not a
historical fact, or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning us or our business, whether express or implied, is meant as and should be considered a forward-looking statement. Such statements represent our opinions
concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.

Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. If these estimates or
assumptions prove to be incorrect, the actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may
depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to Torchmark specifically. Such events or developments could include, but are not
necessarily limited to:

1) Changes in
lapse rates and/or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality, morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions;

2) Federal and state legislative and regulatory
developments, particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal Medicare program that would affect Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance;

3) Market trends in the senior-aged health care
industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans, and that could affect the sales of traditional Medicare Supplement insurance;

4) Interest rate changes that affect product sales
and/or investment portfolio yield;

5)
General economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers’ financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities that we own, or that may impair issuers’ ability to pay interest due us on those securities;

6) Changes in pricing competition;

7) Litigation results;

8) Levels of administrative and operational
efficiencies that differ from our assumptions;

9) Our inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay;

10) The customer response to new products and
marketing initiatives; and

11) Reported
amounts in the financial statements which are based on our estimates and judgments which may differ from the actual amounts ultimately realized.

Readers are also directed to consider other risks and uncertainties described in our other documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Torchmark Corporation

McKinney, Texas

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Torchmark Corporation
and subsidiaries (“Torchmark”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of Torchmark’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on Torchmark’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

Business:

Torchmark Corporation
(Torchmark or alternatively, the Company) through its subsidiaries provides a variety of life and health insurance products and annuities to a broad base of customers.

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), under guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the results of Torchmark and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Torchmark accounts for
its variable interest entities under accounting guidance which clarifies the definition of a variable interest and the instructions for consolidating variable interest entities (VIE’s). Primary beneficiaries only are required to consolidate
VIE’s. Therefore, a company may have voting control of a VIE, but if it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, it is not permitted to consolidate the VIE. The trust that is liable for Torchmark’s Trust Preferred Securities meets the
definition of a VIE. However, Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of this entity because its interest is not variable. Therefore, Torchmark is not permitted to consolidate its interest, even though it owns 100% of the voting equity of the trust
and guarantees its performance. For this reason, Torchmark reports its 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust as “Due to affiliates” each period at its carrying value. However, Torchmark views the Trust Preferred Securities
as it does any other debt offering and consolidates the trust in its segment analysis because GAAP requires that the segment analysis be reported as management views its operations and financial condition.

Additionally, as further described under the caption

Low-Income
Housing Tax Credit Interests

below in this note, Torchmark holds passive interests in limited partnerships which provide investment returns through the provision of tax benefits (principally from the transfer of federal or state tax credits
related to federal low-income housing). These interests are also considered to be VIEs. They are not consolidated because the Company has no power to control the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of these entities
and therefore the Company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these interests. Torchmark’s involvement is limited to its limited partnership interest in the entity. Torchmark has not provided any other financial support to the entities
beyond its commitments to fund its limited partnership interests during 2008, 2009, or 2010, and there are no arrangements or agreements with any of the interests to provide other financial support. The maximum loss exposure relative to these
interests is limited to their carrying value.

When a
component of Torchmark’s business is sold or expected to be sold during the ensuing year, Torchmark reports the assets and liabilities of the component as assets and liabilities of subsidiaries held for sale. Assets or liabilities of
subsidiaries held for sale are segregated and are recorded in the

Consolidated Balance

Sheets

at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated
fair value, a loss is recognized. Major classes of assets and liabilities of subsidiaries held for sale are separately disclosed in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Torchmark reports the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations when the component is sold or
expected to be sold, the operations and cash flows of the business have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction, and Torchmark will not have any significant continuing involvement in the
operations of the business after the disposal transaction. The results of discontinued operations are reported in discontinued operations in the

for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the business is either disposed of or is accounted for as a disposal group, including

Investments:

Torchmark classifies all of
its fixed-maturity investments, which include bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, as available for sale. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected
directly in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in equity securities, which include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Mortgage loans, included in “Other long-term investments,” are carried at amortized cost. Investments in real estate, included in “Other
long-term investments,” are reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method. Short-term investments include investments in interest-bearing time deposits with original maturities of
twelve months or less.

Gains and losses realized on the
disposition of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. Income attributable to investments is included in Torchmark’s net investment income. Net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008
included $522 million, $487 million, and $451 million, respectively, which was allocable to policyholder reserves or accounts. Realized investment gains and losses are not allocated to insurance policyholders’ liabilities.

Fair Value Measurements

:    Fair values for
cash, short-term investments, short-term debt, receivables and payables approximate carrying value. Fair values for long-term debt investments and equity securities are determined in accordance with specific accounting guidance

. Fair values
are based on quoted market prices, where available. Otherwise, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments in active markets, quotes in inactive markets, or other observable criteria. For specific information regarding
Torchmark’s measurements and procedures in valuing financial instruments, please see

Note 4—Investments

under the caption

Fair value measurements.

The fair values of Torchmark’s long-term debt issues, along with the
trust preferred securities, are based on quoted market prices. Mortgage loans are valued at discounted cash flows.

Impairment of Investments:

Torchmark evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment as described in

Note

—

Investments

under the caption

Other-than-temporary-impairments

. If a security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and is treated as a realized
loss. The written-down security will be amortized and revenue recognized in accordance with estimated future cash flows.

In April, 2009, the FASB amended previous guidance concerning other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities and changed the presentation of
other-than-temporary impairments in the financial statements. If an entity intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired security prior to recovery of its cost basis, the security is to be considered
other-than-temporarily impaired and the full amount of impairment must be charged to earnings. Otherwise, losses on securities which are other-than-temporarily impaired are separated into two categories, the portion of loss which is considered
credit loss and the portion of loss which is due to other factors. The credit loss portion is charged to earnings while the loss due to other factors is charged to other comprehensive income, both charges net of tax. The revised guidance called for
an opening cumulative effect adjustment to reclassify any unrecognized after-tax credit loss on each previously other-than-temporarily impaired security held at the beginning of the period of adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings and a
corresponding



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income. The revisions were effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, but early adoption was permitted for periods ending
after March 15, 2009. Disclosures for earlier periods for comparative purposes were not required until the comparative period’s end after initial adoption.

Torchmark elected to early adopt the amended guidance for the periods beginning January 1, 2009. Adoption resulted in no cumulative effect
adjustment to opening retained earnings or to accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2009. Invested assets, total assets, and total shareholders’ equity were not affected by adoption. Application of the new guidance
resulted in an after-tax increase in net income of $13.5 million in 2009, because the portion of other-than-temporary impairment loss related to factors other than credit was recorded in other comprehensive income instead of being reflected in
net income. See

Note 4—Investments

under the caption

Other-than-temporary impairments

for a full discussion and disclosures related to other-than-temporary impairments.

Cash:

Cash consists of balances on hand and on deposit in banks and financial institutions.
Overdrafts arising from the overnight investment of funds offset cash balances on hand and on deposit.

Recognition of Premium Revenue and Related Expenses:

Premium income for traditional long-duration life and health
insurance products is recognized when due from the policyholder. Premiums for short-duration health contracts are recognized as revenue over the contract period in proportion to the insurance protection provided. Profits for limited-payment life
insurance contracts are recognized over the contract period. Premiums for universal life-type and annuity contracts are added to the policy account value, and revenues for such products are recognized as charges to the policy account value for
mortality, administration, and surrenders (retrospective deposit method). Life premium includes policy charges of $26 million, $28 million, and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Other premium
consists of annuity policy charges in each year. Profits are also earned to the extent that investment income exceeds policy liability interest requirements. The related benefits and expenses are matched with revenues by means of the provision of
future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in a manner which recognizes profits as they are earned over the same period.

Future Policy Benefits:

The liability for future policy benefits for universal life-type products is represented by
policy account value. The liability for future policy benefits for all other life and health products, approximately 78% of total future policy benefits, is provided on the net level premium method based on estimated investment yields, mortality,
morbidity, persistency and other assumptions which were considered appropriate at the time the policies were issued. Assumptions used are based on Torchmark’s previous experience with similar products. Once established, assumptions for these
products are generally not changed. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions. These estimates are periodically reviewed and compared with actual experience. If it is determined
that existing contract liabilities, together with the present value of future gross premiums, will not be sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits and to recover unamortized acquisition costs, then a premium deficiency exists. Such a
deficiency would be recognized immediately by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future policy benefits. From that point forward, the liability for future policy benefits
would be based on the revised assumptions.

Deferred
Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased:

The costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other
underwriting costs of new insurance sales. Additionally, deferred acquisition costs include the value of insurance purchased, which are the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies.
Deferred acquisition costs and the value of insurance purchased are amortized in a systematic manner which matches these costs with the associated revenues. Policies other than universal life-type policies are amortized with interest over the
estimated premium-paying period of the policies in a manner which charges each year’s operations in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

proportion to the receipt of premium income. Limited-payment contracts are amortized over the contract period. Universal life-type policies are amortized with interest in proportion to estimated
gross profits. The assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs with regard to interest, mortality, morbidity, and persistency are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits. For interest- sensitive and
deposit-balance type products, these assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations. For all other products, amortization assumptions are generally not revised once
established. Deferred acquisition costs are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing to determine if there is a premium deficiency. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support
the capitalized deferred acquisition cost asset. These cash flows consist primarily of premium income, less benefits and expenses taking inflation into account. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is then compared with
the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance. In the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less, the deficiency would be recognized by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase
in the liability for future benefits, as described under the caption

Future Policy Benefits

.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable:

Torchmark establishes a liability for known policy benefits payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to
the Company. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience. Torchmark makes an estimate after careful evaluation of all information available to the Company. However, there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other
benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, will be Torchmark’s ultimate obligation.

Separate Accounts:

Separate accounts were previously established in connection with Torchmark’s variable life and
annuity businesses. Torchmark disposed of this business as of December 31, 2010. Accordingly, separate account assets and liabilities were included in “Assets or Liabilities of subsidiary held for sale,” respectively, as of December
31, 2009.

Income
Taxes:

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
book values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. More information concerning income taxes is provided in

Note 9—Income Taxes

.

Property and
Equipment:

Property and equipment, included in “Other assets,” is reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is recorded primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives
of these assets which range from two to ten years for equipment and five to forty years for buildings and improvements. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Impairments, if any, are recorded when, based on events and
circumstances, it becomes evident that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Original cost of property and equipment was $119 million and $111 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accumulated depreciation
was $65 million at year end 2010 and $60 million at the end of 2009. Depreciation expense was $6.0 million in 2010, $4.6 million in 2009, and $5.0 million in 2008. During 2008, Torchmark completed the construction of an office
building adjacent to the home office building of its subsidiary United American Insurance Company (United American) in McKinney, Texas. The Company spent approximately $23 million on the building and land, and approximately $3 million on equipment.
Liberty National Life Insurance Company (Liberty), a wholly-owned Torchmark subsidiary, has sold the majority of its agency office buildings. In 2008, five offices were sold for proceeds of $787 thousand, recording a realized gain of $278 thousand
before tax. In 2008, Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company (Globe), a wholly-owned Torchmark subsidiary, sold two office buildings in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma for proceeds of $7.5 million, recording a gain on the sale of $2.6 million. No
buildings were sold in 2009 or 2010.

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Asset Retirements:

Certain of Torchmark’s subsidiaries own and
occupy buildings containing asbestos. These facilities are subject to regulations which could cause the Company to be required to remove and dispose of all or part of the asbestos upon the occurrence of certain events. Otherwise, the subsidiaries
are under no obligation under the regulations. At this time, no such events under these regulations have occurred. For this reason, the Company has not recorded a liability for this potential obligation, as the time at which any obligation could be
settled is not known. Therefore, there is insufficient information to estimate a fair value.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests:

As of December 31, 2010, Torchmark had $283 million invested in limited partnerships that provide low-income housing tax credits and other
related Federal income tax and state premium tax benefits to Torchmark. The carrying value of Torchmark’s investment in these entities was $169 million at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, Torchmark was obligated under future
commitments of $122 million, which amount is included in the above carrying value. Interests for which the return has been guaranteed by unrelated third-parties are accounted for using the effective-yield method. The remaining interests are
accounted for using the amortized-cost method.

For 2010,
the Federal income benefits accrued during the year, net of the amortization associated with guaranteed interests, were recorded in “Income Tax Expense.” Amortization associated with non-guaranteed interests was reflected as a component of
“Net Investment Income.” For years prior to 2010, the Federal income tax benefits accrued during the year, net of amortization associated with all interests,

were recorded in “Income tax expense.” All state premium tax benefits, net of the related amortization, are recorded in “Net investment income.” At December 31, 2010, $269 million was included
in “Other assets” with the remaining $14 million included in “Other invested assets.” At December 31, 2009, the comparable amounts were $149 million and $20 million, respectively. Any unpaid commitments to invest are recorded in
“Other liabilities.”

Goodwill:

The excess cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets is reported as goodwill.

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing based on certain procedures outlined by GAAP. Amortization of goodwill is not permitted. Torchmark tested its goodwill annually in each of the years 2008 through 2010. The tests involve
assigning the Company’s carrying value to each of the reporting units of Torchmark’s segments, including the portion of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is measured against that reporting
unit’s corresponding carrying value. Because the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value, including goodwill, of each reporting unit in each period, Torchmark’s goodwill was not impaired in any of the periods.

Approximately
$27 million of goodwill was associated with a subsidiary sold in 2010, described more fully in

Note 3—Discontinued Operations

.

Treasury Stock:

Torchmark accounts for purchases of treasury stock on the cost method. Issuance of treasury stock is
accounted for using the weighted-average cost method.

Litigation and Tax Settlements:

The Company recorded a $2.9 million tax settlement benefit in 2009 primarily
resulting from the favorable settlements of U.S. Federal income tax issues that related to prior tax years. The Company also recorded a $10.8 million settlement benefit in 2008 related to litigation that occurred in prior years as a result of the
favorable resolution of litigation concerning tax liabilities asserted by Canadian tax authorities covering several years. More information on these tax settlements is provided in

Note 9—Income Taxes

.

Torchmark received an additional pre-tax litigation settlement, net of
expenses, of $1.3 million in 2008 ($.9 million after tax) from investment litigation. Legal settlement costs in the amount of $2.5 million in 2008 ($1.6 million after tax) were expensed relating to litigation issues arising in prior periods and
concerning events occurring many years ago.

The investment
litigation receipts were included in “Other income” in the

Consolidated Statement of Operations

. The legal settlement costs were included in “Other operating expense.” The income tax settlements were included as reductions
to “Income taxes.”

Postretirement Benefits:

Torchmark accounts for its defined benefit
pension plans by recognizing the funded status of its postretirement benefit plans on its

Consolidated Balance Sheets

in accordance with accounting guidance. Periodic gains and losses attributable to changes in plan assets and liabilities
that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are recognized as components of other comprehensive income, net of tax. As of December 31, 2009, Torchmark adopted new accounting guidance requiring new disclosures about assets in
its pension plans. The new disclosures include information about how investment decisions are made, categories of assets, information about how assets are valued, and concentrations of risk. More information concerning the accounting and disclosures
for postretirement benefits is found in

Note 10

Postretirement Benefits.

Stock Compensation:

Torchmark accounts for stock-based compensation by recognizing an expense in the financial statements based on the “fair value method.” The fair value
method requires that a fair value be assigned to a stock option or other stock grant on its grant date and that this value be amortized over the grantees’ service period.

The fair value method requires the use of an option valuation model to
value employee stock options. Torchmark has elected to use the Black-Scholes valuation model for option expensing. A summary of assumptions for options granted in each of the three years 2008 through 2010 is as follows:

All of the above assumptions, with the exception of the expected term, are obtained from independent data services. The expected term is generally derived from Company experience. However, expected terms of grants
made under the Torchmark Corporation 2005 Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) and the 2007 Long-Term Compensation Plan (2007 Plan), involving grants made in the years 2005 through 2010, were determined based on the simplified method as permitted by Staff
Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110. This method was used because the 2005 and 2007 Plans limited grants to a maximum contract term of seven years, and Torchmark had no previous experience with seven-year contract terms. Prior to 2005, substantially
all grants contained ten-year terms. Because a large portion of these grants vest over a three-year period, the Company did not have sufficient exercise history during 2010 or previous years to determine an appropriate expected term on these grants.
Volatility and risk-free interest rates are assumed over a period of time consistent with the expected term of the option. Volatility is measured on a historical basis. Monthly data points are utilized to derive volatility for periods greater than
three years. Expected dividend yield is based on current dividend yield held constant over the expected term. Once the fair value of an option has been determined, it is amortized on a straight-line basis over the employee’s service period for
that grant (from the grant date to the date the grant is fully vested).

Torchmark management views all stock-based compensation expense as a corporate or Parent Company expense and, therefore, presents it as such in its segment analysis (See

Note 14—Business Segments

). It
is included in “Other operating expense” in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

.

Earnings Per Share:

Torchmark presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the

Consolidated
Statements of Operations

. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adding to shares outstanding the additional net
effect of potentially dilutive securities or contracts, such as stock options, which could be exercised or converted into common shares. For more information on earnings per share, see

Note 2—Statutory Accounting

Life insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are required to file statutory financial statements with state insurance regulatory authorities. Accounting
principles used to prepare these statutory financial statements differ from GAAP. Consolidated net income and shareholders’ equity (capital and surplus) on a statutory basis for the insurance subsidiaries were as follows:

More information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends can be found in

Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity.

Torchmark’s statutory financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting practices prescribed by the insurance department of the
state of domicile of each insurance subsidiary. All states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) statutory accounting practices (NAIC SAP) as the basis for statutory accounting. However, certain states have
retained the prescribed practices of their respective insurance code or administrative code which can differ from NAIC SAP. There are no significant differences between NAIC SAP and the accounting practices prescribed by the states of domicile for
Torchmark’s life insurance companies that affect statutory surplus.

Note 3—Discontinued Operations

During the third quarter of 2010, Torchmark’s subsidiary, Liberty, entered into an agreement to sell its wholly-owned subsidiary, United
Investors Life Insurance Company (United Investors), to an unaffiliated insurance carrier. As a result of the agreement, as of September 30, 2010, Torchmark classified the assets of United Investors as held for sale. The sale was completed as of
December 31, 2010. United Investors markets primarily term and interest-sensitive life insurance, fixed annuities, and, prior to 2009, variable annuities. Consideration for the sale consisted of $343 million in cash at the closing, as well as
post-closing proceeds receivable from the buyer of approximately $21 million. The transaction resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately $38 million ($35 million after tax), which has been reported as a realized loss on the disposal of a
discontinued operation. Additionally, Liberty has signed an agreement with the acquirer to service the United Investors insurance and annuity products for an estimated period of eighteen months subsequent to the closing under a service agreement.

Due to the sale, Torchmark’s consolidated financial
statements are presented to reflect the transactions as discontinued operations. The primary operations of United Investors involve lines of business that Torchmark no longer emphasizes. Therefore, Torchmark management believes this transaction will
allow the Company to focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses, as well as provide additional capital.

Significant assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Note 4—Investments (continued)

Fair value measurements:

Torchmark measures the fair value of its
financial assets based on a hierarchy consisting of three levels which indicate the quality of the fair value measurements as described below:

•

Level 1

– fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as
of the measurement date.

•

Level 2

– fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that can otherwise be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3

– fair values are based on inputs that are considered unobservable where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability
as of the measurement date. In this circumstance, the Company has to rely on values derived by independent brokers or internally-developed assumptions. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available to the Company which
may include the Company’s own data or bid and ask prices in the dealer market.

The great majority of the Company’s fixed maturities are not actively traded and direct quotes are not generally available. Management
therefore determines the fair values of these securities after consideration of data provided by third-party pricing services and independent broker/dealers. Over 99% of the fair value reported at December 31, 2010 was determined using data provided
by third-party pricing services. Prices provided by third-party pricing services are not binding offers but are estimated exit values. They are based on observable market data inputs which can vary by security type. Such inputs include benchmark
yields, available trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market data. Where possible, these prices were corroborated against other independent sources. When corroborated prices produce small
variations, the close correlation indicates observable inputs, and the median value is used. When corroborated prices present greater variations, additional analysis is required to determine which value is the most appropriate. When only one price
is available, management evaluates observable inputs and performs additional analysis to confirm that the price is appropriate. All fair value measurements based on prices determined with observable market data are reported as Level 1 or
Level 2 measurements.

When third-party vendor prices
are not available, the Company attempts to obtain at least three quotes from broker/dealers for each security. When at least three quotes are obtained, and the standard deviation of such quotes is less than 3%, (suggesting that the independent
quotes were likely derived using similar observable inputs), the Company uses the median quote and classifies the measurement as Level 2. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no assets valued as Level 2 in this manner with broker quotes.

When the standard deviation is 3% or greater, or the
Company cannot obtain three quotes, then additional information and management judgment are required to establish the fair value. The measurement is then classified as Level 3. The Company uses information and valuation techniques deemed appropriate
for determining the point within the range of reasonable fair value estimates that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, fair value measurements classified as Level 3 represented 1%
of total fixed maturities and equity securities.

The collateral underlying collateralized debt obligations for which fair values are reported as Level 3 consists primarily of trust preferred
securities issued by banks and insurance companies. None of the collateral is subprime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). Of the change in the fair value of Level 3 assets still held at
December 31, 2010, $500 thousand of net realized investment gains was included in net income. At December 31, 2009, the charge to earnings was $86 million.

In 2008 and 2009, respectively, $111 million and $53 million of fixed maturities transferred in to Level 3 from Level 2 due to the lack of
observable market data. There were no transfers into Level 3 in 2010. In 2008, $29 million of fixed maturities transferred out of Level 3 into Level 2 due to the availability of valuations based on observable data. In 2009, $149 million of fixed
maturities transferred out of Level 3 into Level 2 due to the use of an additional pricing vendor whose valuations gave us an additional source of observable data. In 2010, $14 million of fixed maturities transferred out of Level 3 into Level 2 due
to the availability of observable market data.

Torchmark
adopted additional new guidance concerning the disclosures of fair value as of January 1, 2010. This new guidance expanded fair value disclosures by requiring the disclosure of transfers between the Level 1 and Level 2 classifications and the
reasons for the transfers; more detail about the activity

within the Level 3 classification by reporting purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross rather than net basis; proper classification of assets and liabilities; and complete
information about valuation inputs and techniques. The disclosure of the additional detail regarding the Level 3 activity was not required for Torchmark until 2011. However, Torchmark early adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010 as permitted.

In 2010, there was one investment in the amount of $5
million that transferred from Level 1 to Level 2. This was because a direct quote was available at December 31, 2009, but no direct quote was available at December 31, 2010, only observable inputs.

Other-than-temporary
impairments:

Torchmark’s portfolio of fixed maturities fluctuates in value due to changes in interest rates in the financial markets as well as other factors. Fluctuations caused by market interest rate changes have
little bearing on whether or not the investment will be ultimately recoverable. Therefore, Torchmark considers these declines in value resulting from changes in market interest rates to be temporary. In certain circumstances, however, Torchmark
determines that the decline in the value of a security is other-than-temporary and writes the book value of the security down to its fair value, realizing an investment loss. The evaluation of Torchmark’s securities for other-than-temporary
impairments is a process that is undertaken not less frequently than quarterly and is overseen by a team of investment and accounting professionals. Each security which is impaired because the fair value is less than the cost or amortized cost is
identified and evaluated. The determination that an impairment is other-than-temporary is highly subjective and involves the careful consideration of many factors. Among the factors considered are:

•

The length of time and extent to which the security has been impaired

•

The reason(s) for the impairment

•

The financial condition of the issuer and the near-term prospects for recovery in fair value of the security

•

The Company’s ability and intent to hold the security until anticipated recovery

•

Expected future cash flows

The relative weight given to each of these factors can change over time as facts and circumstances change. In many cases, management believes it is
appropriate to give relatively more weight to prospective factors than to retrospective factors. Prospective factors that are given more weight include prospects for recovery, the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security until
anticipated recovery, and expected future cash flows.

Among the facts and
information considered in the process are:

•

Default on a required payment

•

Issuer bankruptcy filings

•

Financial statements of the issuer

•

Changes in credit ratings of the issuer

•

The value of underlying collateral

•

News and information included in press releases issued by the issuer

•

News and information reported in the media concerning the issuer

•

News and information published by or otherwise provided by credit analysts

•

Recent cash flows

While all available information is taken into account, it is difficult to predict the ultimately recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security.

Note 4—Investments (continued)

During 2010, the Company determined that certain of its holdings in fixed maturities were
other-than-temporarily impaired, resulting in writedowns of $4.9 million ($3.2 million after tax) on a CDO and on three corporate bonds. The pretax writedowns included the writedown of the CDO with a carrying amount of $1.7 million to a fair
value of zero ($1.1 million after tax). The corporate bonds were written down $3.2 million ($2.1 million after tax).

During 2009, the Company determined that certain of its holdings in fixed maturities were other-than-temporarily impaired, resulting in writedowns
of $143 million ($94 million after tax) on CDOs and corporate bonds. The pretax writedown included the writedowns of CDOs with a carrying amount of $117 million to a fair value of $13 million, resulting in a total pretax writedown of $104 million.
However, in accordance with accounting guidance regarding other-than-temporary impairments, $83 million of the writedown was determined to be the result of a credit loss and was charged to earnings while the remaining $21 million was charged to
other comprehensive income. The credit loss portion on the CDOs was determined as the difference between the securities’ amortized cost and the present value of expected future cash flows. These expected cash flows were determined using
judgment and the best information available to the Company, and were discounted at the securities’ original effective yield rate. Inputs used to derive expected cash flows included expected default rates, current levels of subordination, and
loan-to-collateral value ratios. Management has determined that the present value of future cash flows is a better measure of fair value due to limited observable market data and because the market for these securities is not active and does not
reflect orderly transactions. The pre-tax writedown for other-than-temporary impairment on corporate bonds of $77 million was all credit related and was included in the charge to earnings.

During 2008, the Company also determined that certain holdings in securities were other-than-temporarily impaired,
resulting in writedowns in the amount of $106 million ($69 million after tax). The pretax writedown includes writedowns of $74 million for bonds issued by Lehman Brothers, $19 million for bonds issued by Washington Mutual, and $1.9 million for
perpetual preferred stock issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association. All of these losses for other-than-temporary impairment were included in realized investment losses.

As of year end 2010, previously written down securities remaining in
the portfolio were carried at a fair value of $68 million. Otherwise, as of December 31, 2010, Torchmark has no information available to cause it to believe that any of its investments are other-than-temporarily impaired. Torchmark has the
ability and intent to hold these investments to recovery, and does not intend to sell nor expects to be required to sell its other impaired securities.

During both 2009 and 2008, certain real estate holdings, measured on a nonrecurring basis, were written down because the carrying values of these
properties were not expected to be recoverable. In 2008, the writedowns consisted of Company-occupied property in the amount of $2.1 million ($1.4 million after tax) and investment real estate in the amount of $1.1 million ($.7 million after tax).
In 2009, additional writedowns in the amounts of $355 thousand ($231 thousand after tax) of Company-occupied real estate and $205 thousand ($133 thousand after tax) of investment real estate were taken on these same properties. The fair values in
2008 were determined based on recent sales of similar properties (Level 2 observable inputs). The 2009 fair value was determined based on a bid (Level 1). The losses on Company-occupied property were included in “Other operating
expenses” and the losses on invested real estate were included as “Other-than-temporary impairments.”

Unrealized loss analysis.

Net unrealized losses on fixed maturities declined from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2008 to
$455 million at December 31, 2009, and then became a net unrealized gain of $108 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, investments in securities in the financial sector were in a $115 million unrealized loss
position, while investments in securities in the other sectors had net gains of $223 million. The financial sector accounted for over 99% of the net unrealized losses in 2009. At December 31, 2008, the financial sector accounted for 56% of
the net unrealized losses. Based upon conditions experienced by companies in the bond market and the commercial paper market,

Note 4—Investments (continued)

management believes that much of the unrealized loss at December 31, 2008 and during the early part of 2009 was attributable to illiquidity in the financial market which contributed to a spread
widening, resulting in increased unrealized losses on many securities that management expects to be fully recoverable. Accordingly, as conditions in financial markets have improved since early 2009, unrealized gains in the portfolio have occurred.
Due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products, Torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery. Even though these fixed maturity investments are available for sale, Torchmark
generally expects and intends to hold any securities which are temporarily impaired until they mature.

The following tables disclose unrealized investment losses by class of investment at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Torchmark
considers these investments to be only temporarily impaired.

Note 7—Liability for Unpaid Health Claims

Activity in the liability for unpaid health claims is summarized as
follows:

At the end of each period, the liability
for unpaid health claims includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Such estimates are updated regularly based upon the Company’s most recent claims data with recognition of emerging experience trends. Because
of the nature of the Company’s health business, the payment lags are relatively short and most claims are fully paid within a year from the time incurred. Fluctuations in claims experience can lead to either over- or under-estimation of the
liability for any given year. The difference between the estimate made at the end of the prior period and the actual experience during the period is reflected above under the caption

Incurred related to: Prior years.

Claims paid in each of the years 2008 through 2010 were settled for
amounts less than anticipated when estimated at the previous year end. The most significant components of these favorable variances were in Torchmark’s UA Independent, UA Branch, and Medicare Part D distribution channels. In each of the years
2008 through 2010, paid health claims have trended downwards and were settled more favorably than the original estimates, resulting in reduced estimates of the claim liability in each year compared with the prior year. The Company’s estimates
at each point have reflected the emerging data and trends. In the Medicare Part D channel, the Company is required to estimate claim discounts that will be received from drug manufacturers. In each of the years 2008 through 2010, the discounts from
the drug manufacturers received in the current year but related to prior year claims were higher than anticipated when the claim liability was determined.

The liability for unpaid health claims is included with “Policy claims and other benefits payable” on the

Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Note 9—Income Taxes (continued)

The effective income tax rate differed from the expected 35% rate as shown below:

The tax effects of temporary differences
that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below:

Torchmark’s Federal income tax
returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS completed its examination of the Company’s 2005, 2006, and 2007 tax years during 2009. The Company recorded a $2.5 million tax benefit to reflect the results of the
examination, including a reduction in its liability for uncertain tax positions relating to these years. The statutes of limitation for the assessments of additional tax are closed for all tax years prior to 2007. Management believes that adequate
provision has been made in the financial statements for any potential assessments that may result from future tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.

Torchmark transacts business in Canada through a branch of one of its
subsidiaries. For tax years prior to 2003, Canadian income tax authorities asserted that the branch carried on business in Canada through a permanent establishment and proposed additional taxes and interest. Torchmark challenged their assertion and
litigated the issue before the Tax Court of Canada. In the second quarter of 2008, the Tax Court in Canada ruled in the Company’s favor and the Canadian tax authorities declined to appeal the Court’s decision. As a result, the Company
recorded an $11.9 million tax benefit in 2008, including $5.4 million relating to the removal of amounts previously recorded by the Company for interest expense anticipated to be owed, net of Federal income tax, and $6.5 million relating to
estimated interest income, net of Federal income tax, required to be paid by the Canadian tax authorities on amounts previously

Note 9—Income Taxes (continued)

deposited with the tax authorities. In 2009, the Company recorded $441 thousand of additional interest income, net of Federal income tax, on amounts remaining to be refunded. No tax years are
currently under examination by Canadian tax authorities.

Torchmark has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $35 million at December 31, 2010 which will begin to expire in 2021 if not
otherwise used to offset future taxable income. In addition, Torchmark had a net capital loss carryover of $36.8 million at December 31, 2009 which was utilized in 2010 to offset capital gains. A valuation allowance is to be provided when it is more
likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized by the Company. No valuation allowance has been recorded relating to Torchmark’s deferred tax assets since, in management’s judgment, Torchmark will more likely than not have
sufficient taxable income in future periods to fully realize its existing deferred tax assets.

Torchmark’s tax liability is adjusted to include the provision for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits (excluding effects of accrued interest, net of Federal tax benefits) for the years 2008 through 2010 is as follows:

If recognized in future periods, $-0-,
$145 thousand, and $518 thousand of the balances at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, would reduce the effective tax rate. The remaining balances relate to timing differences which, if recognized, would have no effect on the
Company’s effective tax rate.

Torchmark’s
continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company recognized interest income of $124 thousand, $1.7 million, and $11.9 million, net of federal income tax benefits, in its

Consolidated Statements of Operations

for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The Company had an accrued interest receivable of $4.1 million

and $3.9 million, net of Federal income tax benefits, as of 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
Company had no accrued penalties at December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Note 10—Postretirement Benefits

Pension Plans:

Torchmark has noncontributory retirement benefit plans and contributory savings plans which cover
substantially all employees. There are also two nonqualified, noncontributory supplemental benefit pension plans which cover a limited number of employees. The total cost of these retirement plans charged to operations was as follows:

Torchmark accrues expense for the defined contribution plans based on a percentage of the employees’ contributions. The plans are funded by the employee contributions and a Torchmark contribution equal to the
amount of accrued expense. Plan contributions are both mandatory and discretionary, depending on the terms of the plan.

Cost for the defined benefit pension plans has been calculated on the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. All plan measurements for the
defined benefit plans are as of December 31 of the respective year. The defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of employees are funded. Contributions are made to funded pension plans subject to minimums required by regulation and
maximums allowed for tax purposes. Defined benefit plan contributions were $13 million in 2010, $15 million in 2009, and $63 million in 2008. Torchmark estimates as of December 31, 2010 that it will contribute an amount not to exceed $20
million to these plans in 2011. The actual amount of contribution may be different from this estimate.

Torchmark has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), which provides to a limited number of executives an additional supplemental defined
pension benefit. The supplemental benefit is based on the participant’s qualified plan benefit without consideration to the regulatory limits on compensation and benefit payments applicable to qualified plans, except that eligible compensation
is capped at $1 million. The SERP is unfunded. However, life insurance policies on the lives of plan participants have been established for this plan with an unaffiliated insurance carrier. The premiums for this coverage paid in 2010 and 2009 were
$2 million and $11 million, respectively, and the cash value at December 31, 2010 was $12 million. Additionally, a Rabbi Trust was established for this plan in 2010 in the amount of $21 million to support the liability for this plan. Because
this plan is unqualified, the Rabbi Trust and the policyholder value of these policies is not included as defined benefit plan assets but as assets of the Company. The liability for this SERP at December 31, 2010 was $38 million and was $32
million a year earlier.

The other supplemental benefit
pension plan is limited to a very select group of employees and was closed as of December 31, 1994. It provides the full benefits that an employee would have otherwise received from a defined benefit plan in the absence of the limitation on benefits
payable under a qualified plan. This plan is unfunded. Liability for this closed plan was $4 million at both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Pension cost for both supplemental defined benefit plans is determined in the same manner as for
the qualified defined benefit plans.

Plan assets in the
funded plans consist primarily of investments in marketable fixed maturities and equity securities and are valued at fair value. Torchmark measures the fair value of its financial assets, including the assets in its benefit plans, in accordance with
accounting guidance which establishes a hierarchy for asset values and provides a methodology for the measurement of value. Please refer to

Note 4—Investments

valuation procedures. The following table presents the assets of Torchmark’s defined benefit pension plans for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Pension Assets by Component at December 31, 2009

Torchmark’s investment objectives for
its plan assets include preservation of capital, preservation of purchasing power, and long-term growth. Torchmark seeks to preserve capital through investments made in high quality securities with adequate diversification to minimize risk. The
portfolio is monitored continuously for changes in quality and diversification mix. The preservation of purchasing power is intended to be accomplished through asset growth, exclusive of contributions and withdrawals, in excess of the rate of
inflation. Torchmark intends to maintain investments that when combined with future plan

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 10—Postretirement Benefits (continued)

contributions will produce adequate long-term growth to provide for all plan obligations. It is also Torchmark’s objective that the portfolio’s investment return will meet or exceed the
return of a balanced market index.

All of the securities in
the portfolio are highly marketable so that there will be adequate liquidity to meet projected payments. There are no specific policies calling for asset durations to match those of benefit obligations.

Allowed investments are limited to equities, fixed maturities, and
short-term investments (invested cash). Equities include common and preferred stocks, securities convertible into equities, and mutual funds that invest in equities. Fixed maturities consist of marketable debt securities rated investment grade at
purchase by a major rating agency. Short-term investments include fixed maturities with maturities less than one year and invested cash. Target asset allocations are as follows with a twenty percent allowable variance as noted.

Short-term divergences due to rapid market movements are allowed. In recent periods, our holdings in equities declined while our holdings in fixed maturities increased. Contributions in each of the years 2010,
2009, and 2008 were $13 million, $15 million, and $63 million, respectively. These contributions were invested primarily in fixed maturities. The decline in equity values in both 2008 and early 2009 was also a contributing factor. While equity
values have recovered somewhat in 2009 and 2010, fixed maturity values have also increased. Our asset allocation targets are currently under review.

Portfolio risk is managed through quality standards, diversification, and continuous monitoring. Equities must be listed on major exchanges and
adequate market liquidity is required. Fixed maturities must be rated investment grade at purchase by a major rating agency. Short-term investments in commercial paper must be rated at least A-2 by Standard & Poor’s with the issuer rated
investment grade. Invested cash is limited to banks rated A or higher. Investments outside of the aforementioned list are not permitted, except by prior approval of the Plan’s Trustees. At December 31, 2010, there were no restricted investments
contained in the portfolio.

The investment portfolio is to
be well diversified to avoid undue exposure to a single sector, industry, business, or security. The equity and fixed-maturity portfolios are not permitted to invest in any single issuer that would exceed 10% of total plan assets at the time of
purchase. Torchmark does not employ any other special risk management techniques, such as derivatives, in managing the pension investment portfolio.

Note 10—Postretirement Benefits (continued)

The following table discloses the assumptions used to determine Torchmark’s pension
liabilities and costs for the appropriate periods. The discount and compensation increase rates are used to determine current year projected benefit obligations and subsequent year pension expense. The long-term rate of return is used to determine
current year expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are included in actuarial gain or loss.

Weighted Average Pension Plan Assumptions

The discount rate is determined based on the expected duration of plan liabilities. A yield is then derived based on the current market yield of a hypothetical portfolio of higher-quality corporate bonds which
match the liability duration. The rate of compensation increase is projected based on Company experience, modified as appropriate for future expectations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is management’s best estimate of the
average rate of earnings expected to be received on the assets invested in the plan over the benefit period. In determining this assumption, consideration is given to the historical rate of return earned on the assets, the projected returns over
future periods, and the spread between the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to compute benefit obligations.

Net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit plans by expense component was as follows:

2009.

Torchmark has estimated its expected pension benefits
to be paid over the next ten years as of December 31, 2010. These estimates use the same assumptions that measure the benefit obligation at December 31, 2010, taking estimated future employee service into account. Those estimated benefits

Postretirement Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions:

Torchmark provides
a small postretirement life insurance benefit for most retired employees, and also provides additional postretirement life insurance benefits for certain key employees. The majority of the life insurance benefits are accrued over the working lives
of active employees. Otherwise, Torchmark does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions and the life insurance benefits described above.

Torchmark’s post-retirement defined benefit plans other than pensions are not funded. Liabilities for these plans are measured as of December

Funded debt:

During 2006, Torchmark established Torchmark Capital Trust III (Trust III) to facilitate the public
offering of 4.8 million shares of $25 par value Trust Preferred Securities. Trust III completed the offering on June 8, 2006 for total proceeds of $120 million. It then exchanged $3.7 million of its common stock and the $120 million of proceeds from
the offering for $123.7 million of Torchmark Junior Subordinated Debentures, due June 1, 2046. Trust III pays quarterly dividends on the Trust Preferred Securities at an annual rate of 7.1%, and receives quarterly payments at the same annual rate
from Torchmark on the Junior Subordinated Debentures. All payments due to be paid by Trust III on the Trust Preferred Securities are guaranteed by Torchmark (see

Note 15

). The securities are redeemable on June 1, 2046, and first callable by
Trust III on June 1, 2011.

Trust III is a variable interest
entity in which Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, Torchmark is prohibited by accounting rules from consolidating Trust III even though it has 100% ownership, complete voting control, and has guaranteed the performance of Trust
III. Accordingly,

$4.3 million related to the offering reduce long-term debt and are amortized over the forty-year redemption period.

On June 30, 2009, Torchmark issued $300 million principal amount of 9.25% Senior Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on
the Notes is payable semi-annually commencing on December 15, 2009. Proceeds from the issuance of this debt, net of expenses, were $296 million. The Notes are redeemable by Torchmark in whole or in part at any time subject to a
“make-whole” premium, whereby the Company would be required to pay the greater of the full principal amount of the Notes or otherwise the present value of the remaining repayment schedule of the Notes discounted at a rate of interest
equivalent to the rate of a United States Treasury security of comparable term plus a spread of 75 basis points. Torchmark used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay its $99 million 8

Commercial Paper:

In December, 2010,
Torchmark entered into a new credit facility with a group of lenders allowing unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. The facility includes a provision which allows Torchmark to increase the facility limit by $200
million if certain conditions are met. The Company also has the ability to request up to $250 million in letters of credit to be issued against the facility. This agreement replaces an earlier agreement which would have expired in August, 2011. The
new agreement is set to terminate on January 7, 2015. The credit facility is further designated as a back-up credit line for a commercial paper program, whereby Torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any
time, with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility limit less any letters of credit issued. Interest is charged at variable rates. At December 31, 2010, Torchmark had $199 million face amount ($199 million carrying amount)
of commercial paper outstanding, $198 million of letters of credit issued, and no borrowings under the line of credit. During 2010, the short term borrowings under the facility averaged approximately $196 million, and were made at an average
yield of .4%, compared with an average balance of $251 million at an average yield of 1.1% a year earlier. The facility does not have a ratings-based acceleration trigger which would require early payment. A facility fee is charged for the entire
facility at a rate of 17.5 basis points. For letters of credit issued, there is an issuance fee of 132.5 basis points. Torchmark is subject to certain covenants for the agreements regarding capitalization and earnings, with which it was in
compliance at December 31, 2010 and throughout the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. Borrowings on the credit facilities are reported as short-term debt on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Acquisition of Common
Shares:

Torchmark shares are acquired from time to time through open market purchases under the Torchmark stock repurchase program when it is believed to be the best use of Torchmark’s excess cash flows. Torchmark
suspended its share repurchase program temporarily from the first quarter of 2009 until the first quarter of 2010 because of uncertain economic conditions. Share repurchases under this program were 3.8 million shares at a cost of $204 million in
2010, 2.1 million shares at a cost of $47 million in 2009, and 7.6 million shares at a cost of $427 million in 2008. When stock options are exercised, proceeds from the exercises are generally used to repurchase approximately the number of shares
available with those funds in order to reduce dilution. Shares repurchased for dilution purposes were 716 thousand shares at a cost of $42 million in 2010, 20 thousand shares at a cost of $869 thousand in 2009, and 487 thousand shares at a cost of

Torchmark retired 4 million shares of treasury stock in December, 2010, 2 million in 2009, and 9 million in 2008.

Restrictions:

Restrictions exist on the flow of funds to Torchmark from its insurance subsidiaries. Statutory
regulations require life insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus. Dividends from insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital
gains on an annual noncumulative basis, or 10% of prior year surplus, in the absence of special regulatory approval. Additionally, insurance company distributions are generally not permitted in excess of statutory surplus. Subsidiaries are also
subject to certain minimum capital requirements. In 2010, subsidiaries of Torchmark paid $371 million in dividends to the parent company. During 2011, a maximum amount of $742 million is expected to be available to Torchmark from
subsidiaries without regulatory approval.

Note 13—Stock-Based Compensation

Certain employees, directors, and consultants have been granted fixed equity options to buy shares of Torchmark stock at the market value of the
stock on the date of grant, under the provisions of the Torchmark stock option plans. The options are exercisable during the period commencing from the date they vest until expiring according to the terms of the grant. Options generally expire the
earlier of employee termination or option contract term, which ranges from seven to eleven years. Employee and consultant stock options generally vest one-half in two years and one-half in three years. Formula-based director grants generally vest in
six months. Stock options awarded in connection with compensation deferrals by certain directors and executives generally vest over a range of six to ten years. All options vest immediately upon the attainment of age 65, subject to a minimum vesting
period of one year for employees or six months for directors. Torchmark generally issues shares for the exercise of stock options from treasury stock. The Company generally uses the proceeds from option exercises to buy shares of Torchmark common
stock in the open market to reduce the dilution from option exercises.

Note 14—Business Segments

Torchmark’s reportable segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance, health insurance, and
annuities. These major product lines are set out as reportable segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management techniques.
There is also an investment segment which manages the investment portfolio, debt, and cash flow for the insurance segments and the corporate function. Torchmark’s chief operating decision maker evaluates the overall performance of the
operations of the Company in accordance with these segments.

Life insurance products include traditional and interest-sensitive whole life insurance as well as term life insurance. Health products are
generally guaranteed-renewable and include Medicare Supplement, Medicare Part D, cancer, accident, long-term care, and limited-benefit hospital and surgical coverages. Annuities include fixed-benefit contracts.

Note 14—Business Segments (continued)

Torchmark markets its insurance products through a number of distribution channels, each of which
sells the products of one or more of Torchmark’s insurance segments. The tables below present segment premium revenue by each of Torchmark’s marketing groups.

Torchmark Corporation

Premium Income By Distribution Channel

Because of the nature of the life
insurance industry, Torchmark has no individual or group which would be considered a major customer. Substantially all of Torchmark’s business is conducted in the United States, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern regions.

The measure of profitability established by the chief
operating decision maker for insurance segments is underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses, in accordance with the manner the segments are managed. It essentially represents gross profit margin on insurance products
before insurance administrative expenses and consists of premium, less net policy obligations, acquisition expenses, and commissions. Interest credited to net policy liabilities (reserves less deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance
purchased) is reflected as a component of the Investment segment in order to match this cost to the investment earnings from the assets supporting the net policy liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 14—Business Segments (continued)

The measure of profitability for the Investment segment is excess investment income, which
represents the income earned on the investment portfolio in excess of net policy requirements and financing costs associated with Torchmark’s debt. Other than the above-mentioned interest allocations and an intersegment commission, there are no
other intersegment revenues or expenses. Expenses directly attributable to corporate operations are included in the “Corporate” category. Stock-based compensation expense is considered a corporate expense by Torchmark management and is
included in this category. All other unallocated revenues and expenses on a pretax basis, including insurance administrative expense, are included in the “Other” segment category. The following tables set forth a reconciliation of
Torchmark’s revenues and operations by segment to its major income statement line items.

Torchmark holds a sizeable investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities, the yield from which is used to offset policy benefit,
acquisition, administrative and tax expenses. This yield or investment income is taken into account when establishing premium rates and profitability expectations of its insurance products. In holding such a portfolio, investments are sold, called,
or written down from time to time, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains or losses generally occur as a result of disposition due to issuer calls, a downgrade in credit quality, compliance with Company investment policies, or other
reasons often beyond management’s control. Unlike investment income, realized gains and losses are incidental to insurance operations, and only overall yields are considered when setting premium rates or insurance product profitability
expectations. While these gains and losses are not relevant to segment profitability or core operating results, they can have a material positive or negative result on net income. For these reasons, management removes realized investment gains and
losses when it views its segment operations.

Assets for each segment are reported based on a specific identification basis. The insurance
segments’ assets contain deferred acquisition costs (including the value of insurance purchased). The investment segment includes the investment portfolio, cash, and accrued investment income. Goodwill is assigned to the insurance segments at
the time of purchase based on the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired for the benefit of that segment. All other assets, representing less than 4% of total assets, are included in the other category. The table below reconciles
segment assets to total assets as reported in the consolidated financial statements.

Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies

Reinsurance:

Insurance affiliates of Torchmark reinsure that portion of insurance risk which is in excess of their
retention limits. Retention limits for ordinary life insurance range up to $2.0 million per life. Life insurance ceded represented .5% of total life insurance in force at December 31, 2010. Insurance ceded on life and accident and health products
represented .3% of premium income for 2010. Torchmark would be liable for the reinsured risks ceded to other companies to the extent that such reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations.

Insurance affiliates also assume insurance risks of other companies.
Life reinsurance assumed represented 3.3% of life insurance in force at December 31, 2010 and reinsurance assumed on life and accident and health products represented .9% of premium income for 2010.

Leases:

Torchmark leases office space and
office equipment under a variety of operating lease arrangements. Rental expense for operating leases was $4.9 million in 2010, $4.9 million in 2009, and $5.1 million in 2008. Future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases having
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2010 were as follows: 2011, $3.7 million; 2012, $2.6 million; 2013, $2.4 million; 2014, $2.0 million; 2015, $2.0 million and in the aggregate, $16.8 million.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
Interests:

As described in

Note 1

, Torchmark has invested $283 million in entities which provide certain tax benefits. As of December 31, 2010, Torchmark remained obligated under these commitments for $122 million,
of which $66 million is due in 2011, $52 million in 2012, and $4 million in 2013.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Torchmark maintains a diversified investment portfolio with limited concentration in any given issuer. At December 31, 2010, the investment portfolio, at
fair value, consisted of the following:

As of December 31, 2010, securities of
state and municipal governments represented 11% of invested assets at fair value. Such investments are made throughout the U.S. At year-end 2010, 5% or more of the state and municipal bond portfolio at fair value was invested in securities issued
within the following states: Texas (34%), Washington (7%), Ohio (7%), Illinois (6%), and Alabama (5%). Otherwise, there was no significant concentration within any given state.

Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Corporate debt and equity investments are made in a wide range of industries. Below are the ten
largest industry concentrations held in the corporate portfolio at December 31, 2010, based on fair value:

At year-end 2010, 7% of invested assets was represented by fixed maturities rated below investment grade (BB or lower as determined by the weighted average of available ratings from rating services). Par value of
these investments was $

1.2 billion, amortized cost was $863 million, and fair value was $731 million. While these investments could be subject to additional credit risk, such risk should generally be reflected in market value of the
securities.

Collateral
Requirements:

Torchmark requires collateral for investments in instruments where collateral is available and is typically required because of the nature of the investment. Torchmark’s mortgages are secured by the
underlying real estate.

Guarantees:

At December 31, 2010, Torchmark had in place four guarantee agreements, all of which were either parent
company guarantees of subsidiary obligations to a third party, or parent company guarantees of obligations between wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2010, Torchmark had no liability with respect to these guarantees.

Trust Preferred
Securities

:    Torchmark entered into a performance guarantee for the obligations of the Torchmark Capital Trust III when the trust preferred securities were issued by that trust. It guarantees payment of distributions and
the redemption price of the securities until the securities are redeemed in full, or all obligations have been satisfied should Trust III default on an obligation. The total redemption price of the trust preferred securities is $120 million.

Letters of
Credit

:    Torchmark has guaranteed letters of credit in connection with its credit facility with a group of banks. The letters of credit were issued by TMK Re, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to secure TMK Re, Ltd.’s
obligation for claims on certain policies reinsured by TMK Re, Ltd. that were sold by other Torchmark insurance companies. These letters of credit facilitate TMK Re, Ltd.’s ability to reinsure the business of Torchmark’s insurance
carriers. The agreement expires in 2015. The maximum amount of letters of credit available is $250 million. Torchmark (parent company) would be liable to the extent that TMK Re, Ltd. does not pay the reinsured party. At December 31, 2010, $198
million of letters of credit were outstanding.

Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Equipment leases

:    Torchmark has guaranteed
performance of a subsidiary as lessee under two leasing arrangements for aviation equipment. One of the leases commenced in 2003 for a lease term of approximately 10 years and the other was entered into in 2009 also for 10 years. Torchmark has
certain renewal and early termination options under the first lease. At December 31, 2010, total remaining undiscounted payments under the leases were approximately $9.3 million. Torchmark (parent company) would be responsible for any
subsidiary obligation in the event the subsidiary did not make payments or otherwise perform under the terms of the lease.

Litigation:

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to
litigation, including claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and
miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material
adverse effect on Torchmark’s financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and
appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as Alabama and Mississippi. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little
or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, particularly Alabama and Mississippi, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse
judgments in any given punitive damage suit.

As previously
disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), United American was named as a defendant in purported class action litigation originally filed on September 16, 2004, in the Circuit Court of Saline County, Arkansas on behalf
of the Arkansas purchasers of association group health insurance policies or certificates issued by United American through Heartland Alliance of America Association and Farm & Ranch Healthcare, Inc. (

Smith and Ivie v. Collingsworth, et al.,

CV2004-742-2). The plaintiffs asserted claims for fraudulent concealment, breach of contract, common law liability for non-disclosure, breach of fiduciary duties, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade
Practices Act, and violation of Arkansas law and the rules and regulations of the Arkansas Insurance Department. Declaratory, injunctive, and equitable relief, as well as actual and punitive damages, were sought by the plaintiffs. On September 7,
2005, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to assert a nation-wide class, defined as all United American insureds who simultaneously purchased both an individual Hospital and Surgical Expense health insurance policy (Form HSXC) and an individual
supplemental term life insurance policy (Form RT85) from Farm & Ranch through Heartland. Defendants removed this litigation to the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas (No. 4:05-cv-1382) but that Court remanded the
litigation back to the state court on plaintiffs’ motion. On July 22, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, asserting a class defined as “all persons who, between January 1998 and the present, were residents of Arkansas,
California, Georgia, Louisiana or Texas, and purchased through Farm & Ranch: (1) a health insurance policy issued by United American known as Flexguard Plan, CS-1 Common Sense Plan, GSP Good Sense Plan, SHXC Surgical & Hospital Expense
Policy, HSXC 7500 Hospital/Surgical Plan, MMXC Hospital/Surgical Plan, SMXC Surgical/Medical Expense Plan and/or SSXC Surgical Safeguard Expense Plan, and (ii) a membership in Heartland.” Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract,
violation of Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and/or applicable consumer protection laws in other states, unjust enrichment, and common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek actual, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, equitable and declaratory
relief. On September 8, 2009, the Saline County Circuit Court granted the plaintiff’s motion certifying the class. On October 7, 2009, United American filed its notice of appeal of the class certification and subsequently filed its appellate
brief on April 8, 2010. On December 2, 2010, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s decision to certify the class. Discovery is ongoing.

As reported in previous SEC filings, on June 3, 2009, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation
(Florida Office) issued an order to Liberty National to show cause why the Florida Office should not issue a final order suspending or revoking Liberty National’s certificate of authority to do insurance business in the State of Florida. The
order asserted that Liberty National has engaged in alleged unfair trade practices in violation of Florida law through past underwriting practices used by Liberty National with regard to insurance applications submitted by persons who live in the
United States but who were not U.S. citizens and persons traveling to certain foreign countries. Liberty National denies the allegations made by the Florida Office. Liberty National responded to the Florida Office’s order in a timely manner and
the matter was transmitted to the Division of Administrative Hearings on July 10, 2009. The matter was assigned to an administrative law judge and was set for hearing commencing on February 1, 2010. On January 21, 2010, the Florida Office filed a
motion for continuance which was granted and the hearing in the Florida Department of Administrative Hearings was held June 7-11, 2010. Each of the parties submitted proposed orders to the Administrative Law Judge on August 18, 2010 for her review.
On November 9, 2010, the Administrative Law Judge issued a recommended order and transmitted it to all parties. The Florida Office filed exceptions to the order and Liberty National filed its response to those exceptions as well as its own
exceptions on December 3, 2010. On February 9, 2011, the Florida Office issued a Final Order that essentially adopted the Administrative Law Judge’s previously recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, in its Final Order,
the Florida Office increased the recommended fines for the four non-willful violations and trebled the fine for each non-willful violation resulting in a total fine of $60,000. A decision whether or not the Final Order will be appealed has not been
made.

As previously reported in filings with the SEC, on
September 23, 2009, purported class action litigation was filed against American Income Life Insurance Company in the Superior Court of San Bernardino County, California (

Hoover v. American Income Life Insurance Company

, Case No. CIVRS
910758). The plaintiffs, former insurance sales agents of American Income who are suing on behalf of all current and former American Income sales agents in California for the four year period prior to the filing of this litigation, assert that
American Income’s agents are employees, not independent contractors as they are classified by American Income. They allege failure to indemnify and reimburse for business expenses as well as failure to pay all wages due upon termination in
violation of the California Labor Code; failure to pay minimum wages in violation of the California Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Order No. 4-2001, originally and as amended; and unfair business practices in violation of the California Business
and Professions Code §§17200, et seq. They seek, in a jury trial, reimbursement for business expenses and indemnification for losses, payment of minimum wages for their training periods, payment of moneys due immediately upon termination
under the California Labor Code, disgorgement of profits resulting from unfair and unlawful business practices, and injunctive relief granting employee status to all of American Income’s California agents. On October 29, 2009, American Income
filed a motion seeking to remove this litigation from the Superior Court in San Bernadino County to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Eastern Division. The U.S. District Court remanded the case without prejudice to the
Superior Court and denied American Income’s motion to dismiss on December 15, 2009. On January 19, 2010, American Income filed a motion to dismiss which was denied by the Superior Court after a hearing held on March 16, 2010. On
September 20, 2010, American Income again filed a motion to remove the case to federal court based upon jurisdictional grounds that had not been available previously. The Company’s motion was not successful, however, and the case was
remanded back to Superior Court. On January 12, 2011, the Superior Court denied the Company’s motion to exercise the arbitration clauses of those agent contracts that contain them; the Company has appealed that denial. Discovery is proceeding.

Note 16—Related Party Transactions

William J. Baxley is a partner in the law firm of Baxley, Dillard, Dauphin, McKnight & James which performs legal services for Torchmark
and certain of its subsidiaries. In 1997, Mr. Baxley was loaned $668 thousand on an unsecured basis at a rate of 6.02%. Repayments are made in the form of legal services at customary rates and are applied against the outstanding balance, amortizing
the loan with interest over its remaining term. In October, 2001, the terms of the loan were revised and an additional amount of $395 thousand was loaned to Baxley. The interest rate was revised to 5.6% and the term of the loan was extended until
July, 2013. The loan is being repaid in accordance with its amortization schedule and all payments are current. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balance of this loan was $217 thousand and $296 thousand, respectively.

Additionally, Torchmark has loaned Mr. Baxley’s wife $883 thousand
secured by a mortgage on a building sold to her in 1997. Prior to 2006, interest was charged at a rate of 7.7%. This loan was originally due to be repaid in 2007 with a balloon payment, but in January, 2006, the outstanding balance of $734 thousand
was refinanced and extended until January of 2023. The interest rate was revised to 5.5%. Scheduled cash payments are made to amortize the loan. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balance of this loan was $587 thousand and $620 thousand,
respectively.

Torchmark also holds funds on behalf of Mr.
Baxley as a part of an agreement established in 2006. Interest is paid to Baxley based on a variable rate computed as the average yield for Aa corporate bonds less fifty basis points, which was 5.0% at December 31, 2010. This account balance was
$74 thousand at year end 2010 and $58 thousand at year end 2009.

Torchmark grants options to certain consultants for their services in addition to their fees. Mr. Baxley received Torchmark options in each of the years 2008 through 2010.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

No disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure have been reported on a Form
8-K within the twenty-four months prior to the date of the most recent financial statements.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Torchmark, under the direction of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has
established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Torchmark in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to Torchmark’s management, including the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

As of the end of the fiscal year completed December 31, 2010, an
evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of Torchmark management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of Torchmark’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as those terms are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon their evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that Torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this Form 10-K. In compliance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C. § 1350), each of these officers executed a
Certification included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

As
of the date of this Form 10-K for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, there have not been any changes in Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect this control over financial
reporting subsequent to the date of their evaluation which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting. No material weaknesses in such internal controls were
identified in the evaluation and as a consequence, no corrective action was required to be taken.

Item 9B.    Other Information

There were no items required.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management at Torchmark Corporation is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis. As a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting, the Company utilizes
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal
control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because
of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

Management evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and based on its assessment, determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2010. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Torchmark Corporation

McKinney, Texas

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Torchmark Corporation
and subsidiaries (“Torchmark”) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Torchmark’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the
risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Torchmark maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of Torchmark and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
