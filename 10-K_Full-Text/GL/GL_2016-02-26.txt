PART I

Item 1.  Business

Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark) is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware in 1979. Its primary subsidiaries are American Income Life Insurance Company (American Income), Liberty National Life Insurance Company (Liberty National), Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company (Globe), United American Insurance Company (United American), and Family Heritage Life Insurance Company of America (Family Heritage).

Torchmark’s website is: www.torchmarkcorp.com. Torchmark makes available free of charge through its website, its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The following table presents Torchmark’s business by primary marketing distribution method.

Insurance

Life Insurance

Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries write a variety of nonparticipating ordinary life insurance products. These include traditional and interest sensitive whole-life insurance, term life insurance, and other life insurance. The following table presents selected information about Torchmark’s life products.

The distribution methods for life insurance products include sales by direct response, exclusive agents and independent agents. These methods are described in more depth in the Distribution Method chart earlier in this report. The following table presents life annualized premium in force by distribution method.

Health Insurance

Torchmark offers limited-benefit supplemental health insurance products that include primarily critical illness and accident plans. These policies are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own. Medicare Supplements are also offered to enrollees in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. Medicare Supplement plans are standardized by federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles and co-payments not paid by Medicare.

On February 4, 2016, Torchmark announced that management has committed to a plan to sell its Medicare Part D business during the calendar year 2016.  Torchmark no longer wishes to emphasize its Medicare Part D business due to declining margins, increased risks, higher drug costs, and increased administrative and compliance costs. Management believes this sale will allow the Company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses.  As the historical results for the Medicare Part D business are accounted for as discontinued operations, all business results and  relevant forward looking statements of the Company are reported as continuing operations.  For further discussion of the disposition of the Medicare Part D business, see

The following table presents supplemental health annualized premium in force for the three years ended

December 31, 2015

by marketing (distribution) method.

Annuities

Annuity products include single-premium and flexible-premium deferred annuities. Annuities in each of the three years ended

December 31, 2015

comprised less than 1% of premium.

Pricing

Premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, and expenses. These assumptions are based on Company experience and projected investment earnings. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products. Profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves.

Collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts.

Underwriting

The underwriting standards of each Torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information from the application and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, pharmacy data, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage or rejected.



Index to Financial Statements

Reserves

The life insurance policy reserves reflected in Torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These reserves, with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. The assumptions used in the calculation of Torchmark’s reserves are reported in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments.

Investments

The nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Fixed maturities represented

96%

of total investments at fair value at

Competition

Torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance companies competing with Torchmark, no individual company dominates any of Torchmark’s life or health markets.

Torchmark’s health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements.

Management believes Torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows Torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.

Regulation

Insurance.

Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. They are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.

Risk Based Capital.

The NAIC requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. All Torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula.

Guaranty Assessments.

State guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used, in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company, to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders. The amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state. Assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes.

Holding Company.

States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and New York.



Index to Financial Statements

Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.

Personnel

At the end of


, Torchmark had 3,115 employees.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business

Product Marketplace and Operational Risks:

The insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many firms. We operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks.

The development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits.

As our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and Globe Life Direct Response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. Adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical. In Globe Life Direct Response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. Less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits.

Economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income. If disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under

Investment Risks

below.

Variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. These reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. The reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. Even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. Significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could require policy obligations to be increased and negatively affect our profit margins and income.

A ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. A downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies.

Rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. These ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. Actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our operations, by limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.

Ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control. In addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated



Index to Financial Statements

company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. Changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. There can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. We cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Reputational Risk:

Damage to the reputation of Torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business.

Negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products, and the persistency of our block of inforce policies.

Life Insurance Marketplace Risk:

Our life products are sold in selected niche markets. We are at risk should any of these markets diminish.

We have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via Globe Life Direct Response solicitation. Deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to unsolicited Globe Life Direct Response marketing could negatively affect this business.

Health Insurance Marketplace Risks:

The health insurance market is subject to substantial legislative scrutiny.

Legislative changes could impact our Medicare Supplement and other supplemental health businesses. The nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business.

Competition in the health market can be significant.

Sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare to seniors. In addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share. We choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. Accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products.

An inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

A significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from Medicare Supplement insurance. Medicare Supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. As a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. Because Medicare Supplement policies are coordinated with the federal Medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the Medicare Supplement policies are necessary. Obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. Accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability.

Investment Risks:

Our investments are subject to market and credit risks.

Our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. A significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. Factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer, and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. These declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Significant



Index to Financial Statements

unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity. It is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. In that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income.

Difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses.

A default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. The risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. We attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. We cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. Significant downgrades of issuers could negatively  impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required. Material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. While we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the write downs of impaired investments. Current net income would be negatively impacted by the write downs, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income.

Declines in interest rates could negatively affect income.

Declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. While we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. Significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. These calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates.

Liquidity Risks:

Our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries.

As a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. Moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Other sources of liquidity also include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing, and reinsurance.

The principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. For example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. Additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. Accordingly, impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow.

We can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. Although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain



Index to Financial Statements

the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. Additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. Limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock.

Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital.

Should credit spreads widen in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. If the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business.

In the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. The availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. Additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets.

Regulatory Risks:

Our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth.

Insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. The primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. State agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. The insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting Torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. Should these changes to our business occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines.

We cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Record and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 has established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the



Index to Financial Statements

Department of the Treasury, and the Affordable Care Act and a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) created the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), originally established under the Department of Health and Human Services and subsequently transferred to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the FIO, FSOC and CCIIO, as well as any other proposals for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs.

Changes to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products it offers, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, or negatively affect our ability to sell some of our products.

Changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability, and change the timing of profit recognition.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability.

If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.

The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief.

Litigation Risk:

Litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries.

We are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. However, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. A number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. These lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. In some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. This discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit.

Our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects.



Index to Financial Statements

Catastrophic Event Risk:

Our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events.

Our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the United States in relatively low-face amounts. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. However, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity, caused by events such as a pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition.

Information Security and Technology Risk:

A security breach, the introduction of malware in our computing environment, employee error or malfeasance, unauthorized access, a natural or man-made disaster, or other unanticipated event could compromise the information security systems of Torchmark or its subsidiaries, and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

A failure in our information security systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, loss of cash flow and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively. In some cases we may not become aware of such incident for some time after it occurs, which could increase our exposure.

Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could access, view, misappropriate, alter or delete confidential information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information.  In addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information.  Any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.

Item 2.  Properties

Torchmark, through its subsidiaries, owns or leases buildings that are used in the normal course of business. Torchmark owns and occupies a 300,000 square foot facility in McKinney, Texas (a north Dallas suburb). This facility is Torchmark’s corporate headquarters and also houses the operations of a subsidiary, United American, as well as the operations of other subsidiaries. In addition, United American leases 5,000 square feet of space in Omaha, Nebraska and, through a subsidiary, leases 2,500 square feet in an office area in Syracuse, New York.

Liberty National, though headquartered in McKinney, Texas, operates its main activities out of a 24,000 square foot facility leased in Hoover, Alabama (a Birmingham suburb). An 8,000 square foot facility is leased for storage in Pelham, Alabama, close to the Hoover facility.

Globe leases a 30,300 square foot office area in the City Place Tower building located in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Globe also leases 11,000 square feet at a nearby facility used for storage. Globe Marketing Services, a subsidiary of Globe, owns a 133,000 square foot facility in Oklahoma City which houses the Globe Life Direct Response operation.

American Income owns and is the sole occupant of an office building located in Waco, Texas. The two-floored building contains 70,000 square feet. American Income also has leased 10,800 square feet in a building across the street from the main office building. American Income Marketing Services, a subsidiary of American Income, owns a 43,000 square foot facility located in Waco, Texas, housing American Income’s direct response operation. American Income also leases office space throughout the United States to support its marketing operations.

Family Heritage owns 50% of a partnership that owns an approximate 66,000 square foot building in Broadview Heights, Ohio (a suburb of Cleveland), serving as Family Heritage’s headquarters. The partnership also leases a portion of the building to unrelated tenants.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark’s financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit.

Torchmark subsidiaries are currently the subject of audits regarding the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed property arising from life insurance policies and a limited number of annuity contracts. These audits are being conducted by private entities that have contracted with forty-seven various states through their respective Departments of Revenue, and have not resulted in any financial assessment from any state nor indicated any liability. The audits are wide-ranging and seek large amounts of data regarding claims handling, procedures, and payments of contract benefits arising from unreported death claims. No estimate of range can be made at this time for loss contingencies related to possible administrative penalties or amounts that could be payable to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the

Selected Financial Data

and Torchmark’s

Consolidated Financial Statements

and

Notes

thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

How Torchmark Views Its Operations:

Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life, and supplemental health insurance to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.

Insurance Product Line Segments.

As fully explained in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, the insurance product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and the administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:

Premium revenue

Less:

Policy obligations

Policy acquisition costs and commissions

Investment Segment.

The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:

Net investment income

Less:

Required interest on net policy liabilities

Financing costs

The tables in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

reconcile Torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2015

. Additionally, this Note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year-to-year comparability and which reconciles to net income. That summary is reproduced below from the

Consolidated

Financial Statements

to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business.

Torchmark’s operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.

Summary of Operations:

Net income was

rose to

$4.09

from

. The per-share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program. Also, each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains, which were

$(0.05)

,

$0.12

, and

$0.03

, in


,


and


, respectively. More information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption

Realized Gains and Losses

in this report where there is a more complete discussion. Also, as explained in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, we do not consider non-operating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments to be part of our segment operating income.

Management has committed to a plan to sell the Medicare Part D business in 2016. Torchmark no longer emphasizes its Medicare Part D business due to declining margins, increased risks, higher drug costs, and increased administrative and compliance costs. Management believes this sale will allow the Company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses as well as provide additional capital to invest. The Medicare Part D business met the criteria for discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and as such, the business is reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements. As this business has been classified as held for sale and its operations are discontinued, the financial results of this business are excluded from Torchmark's continuing operations. For more information, refer to

Note 6—Discontinued Operations

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As shown in the above chart, after-tax segment results of continuing operations rose each year over the prior year from

$509 million

in


to

$520 million

in


to

$523 million

in


. The primary contributor to the growth in both


and


was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment, in which margins rose

$13 million

in


and

$11 million

in


. The life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings



Index to Financial Statements

in each year presented. Also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment, which provided

$5 million

of additional margin in


and

$3 million

in


.

Excess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment, decreased to

$220 million

or

2%

from the prior year amount of

$224 million

. In


, excess investment income increased 3%. Although interest rates increased slightly in


, the low interest rate environment continued to pressure investment yields and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities throughout the three-year period. Excess investment income has also been hampered by a lag in government reimbursements of Medicare Part D costs. The impact of the lost investment income from delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As noted previously, the Medicare Part D business has been classified as discontinued operations. In


and 2014, the timing of cash flows in the Medicare Part D business had a negative impact on excess investment income, pre-tax of approximately $8 million and $5 million, respectively.

Total revenues rose

4%

in


to

$3.8 billion

, or

$146 million

over the prior year total of

$3.6 billion

. Life premium rose

5%

or

$107 million

in


to

$2.1 billion

. Life premium increased $81 million in


to

$2.0 billion

. Net investment income rose $24 million or 3% in


, and rose

2%

or

$16 million

in


. Health premium increased

6%

to

$926 million

in


and contributed $56 million to


revenue growth, after having gained 1% to

$869 million

in


. Health premium contributed $6 million to


revenue growth.

Life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown steadily in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015. The increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency. While premium and underwriting margins grew, margin as a percent of premium fell slightly in


to

27%

, after decreasing from

29%

to

28%

from


to


. These fluctuations were due primarily to higher than expected claims. Net life sales increased

9%

in


to

$412 million

after increasing

12%

in


. The life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption

Life Insurance

.

With regard to health insurance, we primarily market Medicare Supplement insurance and limited-benefit products including critical illness and accident products. In 2013 and 2014, the limited-benefit health premiums have exceeded the Medicare supplement premiums due to the inclusion of Family Heritage at the end of 2012. In late 2014, we experienced an unusually large volume of group sales of our Medicare Supplement product.  As a result of increased growth in group sales, the Medicare Supplement premiums increased

$43 million

, which exceeded the limit-benefit premiums. Health insurance premium income increased

6%

to

$926 million

in 2015. Health net sales fell

13%

to

$156 million

during


, as a result of a

29%

decrease in Medicare Supplement sales.  First-year collected health premium rose

32%

to

$157 million

from the prior year total of

$119 million

. The decrease in 2015 Health net sales and increase in 2015 first-year collected premium was reflective of the previously mentioned large volume of group sales in


. Health margins declined to

22%

, with underwriting income increasing to

$204 million

for


. Margins were

$199 million

for the same period in


. The 2015 change was due to lower pricing margins on the group business sold in 2014.

We do not currently market annuities. See the caption

Annuities

for discussion of the Annuity segment.

The investment segment’s pretax profitability, or excess investment income, is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. In


, net investment income rose

2%

, compared with 3% in


. At the same time, our investment portfolio grew 3% in both


and


. In recent years, net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio due to new investments being made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Also, there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, during which the funds are held in cash. Growth in total investment income is also somewhat negatively affected by Torchmark’s share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. In


and


, net investment income was negatively impacted by our Medicare Part D business. Under the program, we are required to cover certain claim costs in the current period that are the federal government’s responsibility, but are not reimbursed until late in the next calendar year. This delay in reimbursement reduced our funds available for investment in


and


, resulting in reduced investment income in both periods.

The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets. The lower new-money yields resulting from the



Index to Financial Statements

low-interest-rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. Financing costs in


were up slightly to $77 million from $76 million in


. This increase was primarily the result of increased short term borrowings coupled with slightly higher short term interest rates. The 2014 decline resulted from the maturity and repayment in 2013 of our $94.5 million principal amount 7.375%

Notes.

Torchmark’s current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investment-grade securities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 96% of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which

96%

were investment grade at

December 31, 2015

. The average quality rating of the portfolio was A-. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no credit default swaps, or other derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption

Investments

in this report and

Note 4—Investments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for a more detailed discussion of this segment.

Insurance administrative expenses were up

6.5%

in


when compared with the prior year period. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and employee costs, including pension-related costs. Stock compensation expense declined

$4 million

in


to

$28.7 million

compared with an increase of

$7 million

in


to

$32.2 million

. The decline in stock compensation expense in


resulted primarily from lower expense associated with performance shares as well as lower option values on


option awards.

In each of the years


through


, net income was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. Accordingly, as described in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

, we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods.

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Company’s excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. The Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years.

(Amounts in thousands)

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.

A discussion of each of Torchmark’s segments follows. The following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Life Insurance.

Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with


life premium representing

69%

of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented

73%

of the total in


. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.

Life insurance premium rose

5%

to

$2.1 billion

in


after having increased

4%

in


to

$2.0 billion

. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:

LIFE INSURANCE

Premium by Distribution Method

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: “annualized premium in force,” “net sales,” and “first-year collected premium.” Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Globe Life Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.

Annualized life premium in force was $2.15 billion at

December 31, 2015

, an increase of 5% over $2.04 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.96 billion at

December 31, 2013

.

The

American Income Exclusive Agency

has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions. While labor unions are still the core market for this agency, American Income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth. The life business of this agency is Torchmark’s highest-margin life business and it is the largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at

40%

of Torchmark’s


total. This group produced premium income of

$831 million

, an increase of

8%

over the prior year total of

$766 million

, after having risen 7% in


. First-year collected premium was

$156 million

compared to

to

$198 million

in


over the


total of

$172 million

. Net sales increased 13% in


over the


total of

$153 million

. Sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force. The American Income Agency's average agent count rose

11%

to

6,529

for the year ended December 31,


compared with

5,868

for the same period in


. The average agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period. The American Income Agency has been focusing on growing and strengthening middle management to support sustainable growth of the agency force. To accomplish this, we have placed an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel. The agency continues to provide more home-office and webinar training programs. These programs are designed to provide each agent, from new recruits to top level managers, coaching and instruction specifically designed for each individual’s level of experience and responsibility.

The

Globe Life Direct Response

unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches, which include direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. These different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer. The Globe Life Direct Response channel’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation. In recent years, electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology, and



Index to Financial Statements

has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center. We continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates.

While the juvenile market is an important source of sales, it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a Globe Life Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time.

Globe Life Direct Response’s life premium income rose 6% to

$747 million

, representing 36% of Torchmark’s total life premium during


. Life premium in this channel increased 6% in


to

$702 million

over the


total of

$664 million

. Net sales of

$164 million

for this group increased 4% from

The

Liberty National Exclusive Agency

markets individual and group life insurance to middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was

$271 million

in


, a slight decline from

$272 million

in


. Life premium income in


totaled

$276 million

. Net sales increased 4% during


to

$36 million

over the


total of

$34 million

. Net sales in


increased 11%. The increase in net sales during


marked the first increase in several years, reflecting changes in structure of the agency that management has put in place in recent years. First-year collected premium increased 7% to

$28 million

during


and was flat in


compared to


at

$26 million

.

The Liberty average agent count increased

2%

to

1,535

for the year ended December 31,


compared with

1,505

for the same period in


. We continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from small-town markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. Expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated, less-penetrated areas will help create long term agency growth. Additionally, our prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new work site marketing business.

The

Other Agencies

distribution channels offering life insurance include the Military Agency, the UA Independent Agency (which predominantly writes health insurance), and various smaller distribution channels. The Other Agencies contributed

$224 million

of life premium income, or 11% of Torchmark’s total in


, but contributed only 3% of net sales for the year.

LIFE INSURANCE

Summary of Results

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Life insurance underwriting income before insurance administrative expense was

$569 million

in


compared with

$556 million

in


and

$545 million

in


. As a percentage of premium, underwriting margins declined to

27%

in


from

28%

in


. The decrease in underwriting margin as a percentage of premium in


and 2014 was due primarily to higher than expected Globe Life Direct Response policy obligations and to increases in non-deferred acquisition costs in the Globe Life Direct Response and American Income units. Non-deferred acquisition expense



Index to Financial Statements

increased primarily as a result of additional investments made to support our distribution channels which are expected to result in increased sales and premium income in future periods. The higher than expected claims in the Globe Life Direct Response Unit primarily relate to policies issued since 2011 where prescription information was used in the underwriting process for certain policies in order to improve the overall mortality of the policies written. To date, improvements in the actual mortality on such policies have been less than expected, causing an increase in our net policy obligations.

Health Insurance.

Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement insurance, critical illness coverage, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products. In this analysis, all health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement are classified as limited-benefit plans.

Health premium accounted for

31%

of our total premium in


, while the health underwriting margin accounted for

26%

of total underwriting margin, reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance. As noted under the caption Life Insurance, we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to life’s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income.

We do not expect recent health care reform activity to have a significant impact on our operations. The Affordable Care  Act (ACA) imposes an annual fee to health insurance issuers offering commercial health insurance as well as another fee for premium stabilization. These taxes totaled $1.2 million and $1.8 million in


and


, respectively.

The

UA Independent Agency

consists of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark who may also sell for other companies. The UA Independent Agency was Torchmark’s largest health agency in terms of health premium income. In 2015, premium income was

$345 million

, representing

37%

of Torchmark’s total health premium. Net sales were

$72 million

, or

46%

of Torchmark’s health sales. This agency is Torchmark’s largest producer of Medicare Supplement insurance, with Medicare Supplement premium income of

$330 million

. The UA Independent Agency represents approximately 71% of all Torchmark Medicare Supplement premium and 93% of Medicare Supplement net sales. Medicare Supplement premium in this agency rose 15%. Total health premium increased 13% in


and 2% in


. Medicare Supplement net sales decreased 15% in


from prior year. Individual sales were up 36% due to the high volume of sales in late 2014 and 2015. As previously discussed, group sales significantly increased in late 2014 resulting in a 42% decline in the current year, which is consistent with historical fluctuation from period to period.

The

Family Heritage Exclusive Agency

primarily markets limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. Most of their policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. Management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of Torchmark’s recruiting programs. The Family Heritage Agency contributed

$50 million

in net sales in


, compared with

$47 million

in


and

$44 million

in


. Health premium income was

$221 million

in


, representing

24%

of Torchmark’s health premium. This compared with $205 million or 24% of health premium in


and $191 million or 22% in


. The average agent count was 882 for the year ended December 31,


, compared with 740 for the same period in


, an increase of 19%.

The

Liberty National Exclusive Agency

represented 23% of all Torchmark health premium income at $209 million in


. The Liberty Agency markets limited-benefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance. Much of Liberty’s health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees. In


, health premium income in the Agency declined 6% from prior year premium of $222 million after declining 8% during 2014. Liberty’s health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining Medicare Supplement block.

Other distribution.

Certain of our other distribution channels market health products, although their main emphasis is on life insurance. On a combined basis, they accounted for 16% of health premium in


. The American Income Exclusive Agency primarily markets accident plans. The Direct Response group markets primarily Medicare Supplements to employer or union-sponsored groups. Direct Response added $5 million of Medicare Supplement net sales in


compared with $23 million in


. The higher net sales in


were due to the addition of a large new group in the third quarter of


.

As presented in the following table, Torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 3% to $204 million in


, after an increase of 1% to $199 million in 2014. As a percentage of health premium, margins were down slightly to 22% in 2015, due to increased benefit ratios in the Direct Response and UA channels. The group business sold in 2014 was priced at higher benefit ratios.

Summary of Results

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Annuities.

Our fixed annuity balances at the end of


,


, and


were $1.32 billion, $1.36 billion, and $1.38 billion, respectively. Underwriting income was

$4.6 million

,

$4.3 million

, and $3.9 million in each of the respective years.

While the fixed annuity account balance has been declining slightly year over year, underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year. Policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year. The majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are based on a function of account size and time lapsed since deposit. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. In the three-year period, however, spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums.

We do not currently market annuity products, favoring instead protection-oriented life and health insurance products. Therefore, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.

, consistent with the


increase over


. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and employee costs, including pension-related costs. The decline in stock compensation expense is primarily due to lower expense associated with performance share awards and lower option values on the 2015 grants. The decline in legal settlement expense was attributable to certain legal and administrative settlements that occurred in


. As described in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes on the Consolidated Financial Statements

, we recorded legal accruals involving non-insurance matters, partially offset by proceeds for investment litigation. Litigation not related to our direct insurance operations is not considered an insurance administrative expense by Torchmark management and is removed from its analysis of core insurance operations in its segment reporting.



Index to Financial Statements

Investments.

We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in

Note 14—Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial

Statements.

It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs.”

We also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used over $6.5 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

Excess Investment Income

.  The following table summarizes Torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income.

Analysis of Excess Investment Income

.

(2) Net of deferred acquisition costs, excluding the associated unrealized gains and losses thereon.

Excess investment income decreased $5 million or 2% in


over the prior year. Excess investment income increased $6 million or 3% in


. Excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption. On a per diluted share basis, excess investment income increased 2% to $1.73 in


. Excess investment income increased 8% to $1.69 per share in


, after having declined 3% in the prior year. The significant increase in the 2014 per share amount over 2013 and the increase in the 2015 per share amount over 2014, versus the decrease in dollar amount of excess investment income, is a result of the share repurchase program.

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 2% to $774 million in


. It increased 3% to $758 million in


from $735 million in


. Growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment. In


, fixed maturity yields averaged 5.84% on a tax-equivalent and effective-yield basis, compared with 5.91% in


and 5.94% in


. Even though mean invested assets have increased each period, net investment income has grown at a slower pace as a result of the decline in average yields. The overall average portfolio yield decreased in the 2013



Index to Financial Statements

to 2015 periods as new money is being invested at lower prevailing yields, and from the result of reinvesting proceeds from bonds that matured or were called at yield rates less than the rates we earned on the bonds before they matured or were called. A significant amount of calls were a negative factor on net investment income in 2013, but calls and maturities were very limited in their affect in 2014 and 2015. During 2014 and 2015, the proceeds from all dispositions have been reinvested at yield rates closer to the yield rates on the disposed assets.

Net investment income has also been negatively affected in 2014 and


by the CMS requirement for us to pay certain Medicare Part D claims costs during the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government, but are not reimbursed until the following year. Because of the overall design of the program and higher Part D claims due to the approval of new Hepatitis C drugs and higher overall drug costs, we have incurred extensive upfront costs that are not reimbursed by CMS until late in the following respective year. These delays in reimbursements have caused a delay in cash flows available for new investments that resulted in a loss of approximately $5 million and $8 million of pre-tax net investment income in 2014 and


, respectively, and will cause us to lose approximately $9 million of additional investment income in 2016.

Presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets.

While net investment income in recent years has been negatively impacted by the factors discussed above, we would expect to see only modest declines in the average portfolio yield rate over the next few years. We anticipate that less than 2% of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years and the average yield rate on assets acquired with the proceeds of dispositions is not expected to be significantly less than the yield rate earned on the assets prior to their disposal. Accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that dispositions will have a significant negative impact on net investment income and the growth rate of net investment income in the next few years.

Required interest on net insurance policy liabilities

r

educes net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” the required interest included in the insurance segments.  As such, it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments. As discussed in

Note 14-Business Segments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. Required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force. The great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. That rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed. The discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. As such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted-average discount rate due to the size of our in force business.

Because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business, benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs. Due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weighted-average discount rate of our in force block, we don’t expect an extended low-interest-rate environment to cause a loss recognition event.



Index to Financial Statements

Information about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table.

Required Interest on Net Insurance Policy Liabilities

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

The large increases in 2013 are due to the inclusion of Family Heritage for a full year.

Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the

Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Analysis of Financing Costs

(Amounts in thousands)

Financing costs increased slightly from 2014 to 2015. The decrease of $4 million or 5% in


was related to the maturity and repayment of our $94 million par amount 7.375% Notes during the third quarter of 2013. In


, interest on short-term debt increased primarily because of the increase in the weighted-average interest rate and the average balance on short-term debt. More information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the

Financial

Condition

section of this report and in

Note 11—Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

As previously noted, growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs as has been the case in recent years. In an extended low-interest-rate environment, the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long-term rates. We believe, however, the decline would be relatively slow as on average less than 2% of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years.



Index to Financial Statements

In response to the lower interest rates, we raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in early 2012 and again in late 2013. The increased premium provides additional margin on these policies to help offset higher mandatory cash values and the possible future reductions in excess investment income. Despite these increases in premium rates, we have continued to see growth in net sales.

Excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates. Therefore, Torchmark would benefit if rates, especially long-term rates, were to rise.

Investment Acquisitions

.  Torchmark’s investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If longer-term securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available, we do not relax our quality objectives, but instead, consider investing in shorter term or lower yielding securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors.

During calendar years


through


, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities, primarily in corporate bonds with longer-term maturities. The following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years. The effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield, commonly referred to as the “worst call date.” For non-callable bonds, the worst-call date is always the maturity date. For callable bonds, the worst-call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield, typically the first call date.

Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

(1) Tax-equivalent basis, where the yield on tax-exempt securities, is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable      securities.

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. However absent sales, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.

During the three years


through


, acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions.  All of the acquired securities were investment grade. In addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions, Torchmark invested $30 million in a limited partnership in


. The limited partnership is a diversified investment fund that currently invests opportunistically in global credit assets with the potential for attractive returns relative to risk. It is classified within long-term investments.



Index to Financial Statements

New cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations and coupons received on existing investments. In some years, a significant amount of new investments can be derived from proceeds from dispositions including issuer calls. Issuer calls, as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years were an important factor, especially in


. Calls increase funds available for investment, but as noted earlier in this discussion, they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than those of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $178 million in


, $160 million in


, and $344 million in


. The higher level of acquisitions in


was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of


calls. The lower level of acquisitions in 2014 was primarily due to the delay in receiving CMS reimbursements as discussed earlier.

$1.7 billion

at

of gross unrealized losses, compared with the

net unrealized gain which consisted of a gross unrealized gain of

$1.7 billion

and a gross unrealized loss of

$79 million

. As described in

Note 4—Investments

in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

the increase in gross unrealized losses was partially attributable to rising interest rates in the financial markets, but also resulted from deteriorating conditions in the energy and metals and mining sectors.

Corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers.The total fixed maturity portfolio consists of 563 issuers, with 205 issuers within the financial, utility, and energy sectors.

Financial and Utilities.

At

December 31, 2015

, the fixed maturity securities in the financial and utility sectors had net unrealized gains of $288 million and $196 million, respectively. Less than 6% of the book value of the holdings in each of these sectors was rated below-investment grade. While the fair market value of the securities in these two sectors declined during the year, Torchmark does not believe that its fixed maturity securities in the financial and utility sectors pose a significant credit risk in the foreseeable future or that any of these securities are other-than-temporarily impaired.

Energy and Basic Materials

.  The current low price of oil and other commodities is putting some downward price pressure on some of our holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors, resulting in lower fair values of these sectors as noted above. Our energy sector investments accounted for 12% of fixed maturities at amortized cost and 10% of fixed maturities at fair value as of

December 31, 2015

.  At amortized cost, over 93% of the energy holdings are investment grade. Within our energy portfolio, 53% of the holdings at amortized cost are in pipelines, 34% are in exploration and production, 6% are in oil field services, and the remainder are in refineries and drilling. We believe securities in drilling and oil field services with an amortized cost of $44 million rated below investment grade have the greatest risk of exposure to the current market conditions. Our investments in basic materials accounted for 8% of fixed maturities at amortized cost and 7% of fixed maturities at fair value as of

December 31, 2015

. At amortized cost, over 95% of these holdings are investment grade. Within this sector, 49% of the holdings at amortized cost are in chemicals, 40% are in mining, and the remainder are in forestry products.

While a sustained period of low oil and natural gas prices and depressed demand for commodities may lead to some downgrades in these sectors, we believe that our investments will be able to withstand lower energy and commodity prices for an extended duration.  Due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by our insurance products, Torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery. Even though these fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale, Torchmark generally intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired.  As of

December 31, 2015

, Torchmark does not believe that any of its holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors are other-than-temporarily impaired.

An analysis of changes in our portfolio of below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows:

Below-investment grade fixed maturities

At

December 31, 2015

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages and we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending, we have no off-balance sheet investments, and we have only an insignificant exposure to European sovereign debt

consisting of $2 million in German government bonds at

. Our exposure to Puerto Rican obligations is insignificant.



Index to Financial Statements

Market Risk Sensitivity.

Torchmark’s investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio. Since 96% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, as is permitted by GAAP, these liabilities are not recorded at fair value.

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at

December 31, 2015

and


. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.

Realized Gains and Losses.

Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.

Investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses generally occur only incidentally, usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity.

Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity.

The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. While the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income.

Parent Company Liquidity.

Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, operating expenses of the Parent, and Parent Company dividends to Torchmark shareholders. In


, the Parent received

$466 million

of cash dividends from its subsidiaries, compared with

$479 million

in


and

$488 million

in


. Including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in


of approximately $358 million, compared with $377 million in


and $364 million in


. Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as insurance subsidiary capital or financing needs, strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In


, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive approximately $450 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately $320 to $330 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of

Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company.



Index to Financial Statements

Short-Term Borrowings.

An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million. In July 2014, Torchmark replaced a $600 million facility with this agreement, as discussed in

Note 11—Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,

under the caption

Commercial Paper

. The facility, like the previous, is further designated as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program. As of

December 31, 2015

, we had available $332 million of additional borrowing capacity under this new facility, compared with $314 million a year earlier. There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended

December 31, 2015

.

In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for


and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, additional borrowings on our short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.

Consolidated Liquidity

.

Consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were

$1.1 billion

in


, compared with

$880 million

in


and

$1.1 billion

in


. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies received proceeds from maturities, calls, and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of $376 million in 2015, compared with $273 million in 2014 and $494 million in 2013.

Our cash and short-term investments were

$116 million

at year-end


and

$82 million

at year-end


. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $13.8 billion at

December 31, 2015

. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

As a part of its aforementioned credit facility, Torchmark had outstanding

$177 million

in stand-by letters of credit at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$198 million

a year earlier. These letters are issued among our subsidiaries, one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer, and have no impact on company obligations as a whole. Any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of off-shore captive reinsurers might require Torchmark to obtain third-party financing, which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs.

As of

December 31, 2015

, we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities. All of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in

Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Index to Financial Statements

The following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of

December 31, 2015

.

Contractual Obligations

(Amounts in thousands)

(1)

Funded debt is itemized in

Note 11—Debt

and includes short-term commercial paper.

(2)

Interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.

(3)

Pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans. They are offset by invested assets in the trusts, which are funded through periodic contributions by Torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due. Therefore, our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on Torchmark’s

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. At

December 31, 2015

, these pension obligations were

$477 million

, but there were also assets of

$308 million

in the pension entities. The schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations, except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted. There are also obligations for benefits other than pensions with a liability of $22 million. Please refer to

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for more information on pension obligations.

(4)

Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at

December 31, 2015

. These estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of

$12.2 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.

Capital Resources.

Torchmark’s capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in

Note 11—Debt

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

and the current maturity of funded debt

),

long-term funded debt, and shareholders’ equity. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in

Note 11

.

The carrying value of the funded debt was

$993 million

at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$992 million

a year earlier. Torchmark has a 6.375% Senior Note that matures on June 15, 2016 with a par value and book value of

$250 million

. As this issue matures within one year, it has been reclassified to short term debt. Torchmark intends to refinance the debt during calendar 2016 with a hybrid debt instrument.

Our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of 325% of Company action level regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark. At

December 31, 2015

, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had RBC ratios of approximately 320%. Should we experience impairments and/or ratings downgrades within its fixed maturity portfolio in the future, the ratio could fall below targeted levels. In such a case, management believes more than sufficient liquidity exists at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the targeted ratio.

As noted under the caption

Summary of Operations

in this report, we have an ongoing share repurchase program. Under this program, we acquired 6 million shares at a cost of $359 million in


, 7 million shares at a cost of $375 million in


, and 8 million shares for $360 million in


. The majority of purchased shares are retired each



Index to Financial Statements

year. Please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption

Summary of Operations

in this report.

Torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years. In the first quarter of


, it was increased to

$0.1133

per share from $0.10 per share. In the first quarter of


, it was raised to

$0.1267

per share. Finally, in the first quarter of


, dividends were raised to

$0.135

per share.

Shareholders’ equity was

$4.1 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$4.7 billion

at

December 31, 2014

. During the twelve months since

December 31, 2014

, shareholders’ equity was reduced by the $359 million in share purchases under the repurchase program, $60 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises, and $750 million of after-tax unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio. However, it was increased by

$527 million

of net income.

We plan to use excess cash available at the Parent Company as efficiently as possible in the future. Possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies.

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders’ equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. From time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.



Index to Financial Statements

The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmark’s capital structure.

(1)

Amount added to (deducted from) comprehensive income to produce the stated GAAP item.

(2)

Includes the value of insurance purchased.

(3)

Torchmark’s debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity.

FASB guidance provides for an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. However, unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. Therefore, we have not elected this option.

Torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 11.0 times in


, compared with 11.3 times in


and 10.4 times in


(as adjusted for discontinued operations and the adoption of ASU 2014-01

Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects

). This times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense.  A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption

Investments

in this report.

Financial Strength Ratings.

The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by Standard & Poor’s and A. M. Best. The following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at

December 31, 2015

.

A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations. It assigns an A (Excellent) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) to those insurers which have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments which differs from the highest-rated insurers only to a small degree. An insurer rated A has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers in higher-rated categories. The plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.

In the third quarter of 2014, Standard and Poor's (S&P) revised its outlook on Torchmark's capital position to a negative outlook. That updated outlook was due to S&P's view at that time at certain internal components of Torchmark's capital position rather than a change in the capital position itself. However, during the fourth quarter of


, S&P formally reviewed our operations and financial outlook. Based on their review, they revised their outlook from negative to stable and confirmed our "AA-" financial strength ratings at our insurance subsidiaries and Torchmark Corporation's senior debt "A" credit rating. We intend to maintain adequate capital levels for S&P and any changes to our capital position  to maintain such levels are not expected to have any significant impact on our share repurchase program or our financial results in future periods.

OTHER ITEMS

Litigation.

Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since Torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Future Policy Benefits:

Due to the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Approximately

85%

of our liabilities for future policy benefits at

December 31, 2015

were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

under the caption

Future Policy Benefits.

Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. Torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended

December 31, 2015

.

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

:

Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in

Note


—

Significant Accounting Policies

under the caption

Deferred Acquisition Costs

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additionally, the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies, known as the value of insurance purchased, is included in deferred acquisition costs. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in

Note 1.

Approximately 99% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at

December 31, 2015

were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are “locked-in” at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended

December 31, 2015

.

The remaining 1% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended

December 31, 2015

.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable

:

This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.

Valuation of Fixed Maturities

:

We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to



Index to Financial Statements

be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to manage risk. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption

Market Risk

Sensitivity

in this report. However, as discussed under the caption

Financial Condition

in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.

At times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. Illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is presented in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

and in

Note 4—Investments

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

under the captions

Fair Value Measurements

in both notes.

Impairment of Investments

:

We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

and the discussions under the captions

Investments

and

Realized Gains and

Losses

in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.

Defined benefit pension plans

:

We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At

December 31, 2015

, our gross liability under these funded plans was

$477 million

, but was offset by assets of

$308 million

.



Index to Financial Statements

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans. For example, a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year


and projected benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2015

.

(1)

The discount rate was

4.23%

for


expense and

4.64%

for the projected benefit obligation at

December 31, 2015

.

(2)

The expected return rate assumed was 6.96%.

The Company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broad-based studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales. During 2014, the Company revised the mortality assumptions based on an evaluation of a new mortality table and longevity scale released by the Society of Actuaries. The change in these assumptions added approximately $26 million to the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014.

The criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us.

Note 9

also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

We caution readers regarding certain forward-looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this document, and in any other statements made by us or on our behalf whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any statement that is not a historical fact, or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning us or our business, whether express or implied, is meant as and should be considered a forward-looking statement. Such statements represent our opinions concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.

Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. If these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, the actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to Torchmark specifically. Such events or developments could include, but are not necessarily limited to:

1) Changes in lapse rates and/or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality, morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions;

2) Federal and state legislative and regulatory developments, particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal Medicare program that would affect Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance;

3) Market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans, and that could affect the sales of traditional Medicare Supplement insurance;

4) Interest rate changes that affect product sales and/or investment portfolio yield;

5) General economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers’ financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities that we own, or that may impair issuers’ ability to pay interest due us on those securities;

6) Changes in pricing competition;

7) Litigation results;

8) Levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ from our assumptions;

9) Our inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay;

10) The customer response to new products and marketing initiatives; and

11) Reported amounts in the financial statements which are based on our estimates and judgments which may differ from the actual amounts ultimately realized.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Torchmark Corporation

McKinney, Texas

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries (Torchmark) as of

December 31, 2015

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2015

. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of Torchmark’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

Business

:

Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark or alternatively, the Company) through its subsidiaries provides a variety of life and health insurance products and annuities to a broad base of customers.

Basis of Presentation

:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), under guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the results of Torchmark and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. When Torchmark acquires a subsidiary or a block of business, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets is recorded as goodwill. Expenses incurred to effect the acquisition are charged to earnings as of the acquisition date. Upon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date.

Torchmark accounts for its variable interest entities (VIEs) under accounting guidance which clarifies the definition of a variable interest and the instructions for consolidating VIEs. Only primary beneficiaries are required or allowed to consolidate VIEs. Therefore, a company may have voting control of a VIE, but if it is not the primary beneficiary, it is not permitted to consolidate the VIE. As further described under the caption

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests

below in this note, Torchmark holds passive interests in limited partnerships which provide investment returns through the provision of tax benefits (principally from the transfer of federal or state tax credits related to federal low-income housing). These interests are considered to be VIEs. They are not consolidated because the Company has no power to control the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of these entities and therefore the Company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these interests. Torchmark’s involvement is limited to its limited partnership interest in the entities. Torchmark has not provided any other financial support to the entities beyond its commitments to fund its limited partnership interests, and there are no arrangements or agreements with any of the interests to provide other financial support. The maximum loss exposure relative to these interests is limited to their carrying value.

When a component of Torchmark’s business is expected to be sold during the ensuing year, Torchmark considers whether the criteria of  ASC 205-20,

Discontinued Operations

, have been met, which includes evaluating if the disposal of a component represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company. If the disposal meets the criteria for discontinued operations, the assets and liabilities of components held for sale are segregated and are recorded in the

Consolidated Balance Sheets

as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale for all periods presented. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized. The results of operations for the component held for sale are reported in "Income from discontinued operations, net of tax" in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

for current and prior periods. Discontinued operations are reported commencing in the period in which the business is either disposed of or meets the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, including any gain or loss recognized on the sale or adjustment of the carrying amount to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. As discussed in further detail in

Note 6—Discontinued Operations

, Torchmark has classified one of its operating segments, Medicare Part D, as held for sale and it is reflected as a discontinued operation for the year ended

December 31, 2015

. As this business has been classified as held for sale and its operations are discontinued, the financial results of this business are excluded from Torchmark's continuing operations and the

Investments

:

Torchmark classifies all of its fixed maturity investments, which include bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, as available for sale. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in equity securities, which include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income. Policy loans are

carried at unpaid principal balances. Investments in real estate, included in “Other long-term investments,” are reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method. Investments in limited partnerships, also included in "Other long-term investments," are accounted for using the cost method of accounting as Torchmark's partnership interest is minor since Torchmark lacks the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnership's operating and financial policies.

The Company considers its cost method investments for impairment when the carrying value of such investments exceeds the net asset value (“NAV”).

Short-term investments include investments in interest-bearing time deposits with original maturities of twelve months or less.

Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. Income attributable to investments is included in Torchmark’s net investment income. Net investment income and realized investment gains and losses are not allocated to insurance policyholders’ liabilities.

Fair Value Measurements, Investments in Securities

:

Torchmark measures the fair value of its fixed maturities and equity securities based on a hierarchy consisting of three levels which indicate the quality of the fair value measurements as described below:

•

Level 1

– fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date.

•

Level 2

– fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that can otherwise be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3

– fair values are based on inputs that are considered unobservable where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability as of the measurement date. In this circumstance, the Company has to rely on values derived by independent brokers or internally-developed assumptions. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available to the Company which may include the Company’s own data or bid and ask prices in the dealer market.

The great majority of Torchmark's fixed maturities are not actively traded and direct quotes are not generally available. Management therefore determines the fair values of these securities after consideration of data provided by third-party pricing services, independent broker/dealers, and other resources. At

December 31, 2015

, Torchmark's investments in fixed maturities were primarily composed of the following significant security types: Corporate securities, state and municipal securities, redeemable preferred stocks, and U.S. government securities. The remaining security types represented less than

1%

of the total in the aggregate.

Over

95%

of the fair value reported at

December 31, 2015

was determined using data provided by third-party pricing services. Prices provided by these services are not binding offers but are estimated exit values. Third-party pricing services use proprietary pricing models to determine security values by discounting cash flows using a market-adjusted spread to a benchmark yield. For all asset classes within Torchmark’s significant security types, third-party pricing services use a common valuation technique to model the price of the investments using observable market data. The foundation for these models consists of developing yield spreads based on multiple observable market inputs, including but not limited to: benchmark yield curves, actual trading activity, new issue yields, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, sector-specific data, economic data, and other inputs that are corroborated in the market. Pricing vendors monitor and review their pricing data continuously with current market and economic data feeds, augmented by ongoing communication within the dealer community.

Using the observable market inputs described above, spreads to an appropriate benchmark yield are further developed by the vendors for each security based on security-specific and/or sector-specific risk factors, such as a security’s terms and conditions (coupon, maturity, and call features), credit rating, sector, liquidity, collateral or other cash flow options, and other factors that could impact the risk of the security. Embedded repayment options, such as call and redemption features, are also taken into account in the pricing models. When the spread is determined, it is added to



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

the security’s benchmark yield. The security's expected cash flows are discounted using this spread-adjusted yield, and the resulting present value of the discounted cash flows is the evaluated price.

When third-party vendor prices are not available, the Company attempts to obtain valuations from other sources, including but not limited to broker/dealers, broker quotes, and prices on comparable securities.

When valuations have been obtained for all securities in the portfolio, management reviews and analyzes the prices to ensure their reasonableness, taking into account available observable information. When two or more valuations are available for a security and the variance between the prices is 10% or less, the close correlation suggests similar observable inputs were used in deriving the price, and the mean of the prices is used.  Securities valued in this manner are classified as Level 2. When the variance between two or more valuations for a security exceeds 10%, additional analysis is performed to determine the most appropriate value for that security, using resources such as broker quotes, prices on comparable securities, recent trades, and any other observable market data. Further review is performed on the available valuations to determine if they can be corroborated within reasonable tolerance to any other observable evidence. If one of the valuations or the mean of the available valuations for a security can be corroborated with other observable evidence, then the corroborated value is used and reported as Level 2. The Company uses information and analytical techniques deemed appropriate for determining the point within the range of reasonable fair value estimates that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions. Valuations that cannot be corroborated within a reasonable tolerance are classified as Level 3. As of

December 31, 2015

and


, fair value measurements classified as Level 3 represented

4.4%

and

4.0%

, respectively, of total fixed maturities and equity securities.

Torchmark invests in a portfolio of private placement bonds which are not actively traded. This portfolio is managed by third parties and was

$542 million

at amortized cost and

$546 million

at fair value on

December 31, 2015

, compared with

$497 million

at amortized cost and

$513 million

at fair value a year earlier. The portfolio managers provide valuations for the bonds based on a pricing matrix utilizing observable inputs, such as the benchmark treasury rate and published sector indices, and unobservable inputs such as an internally-developed credit rating. If the unobservable inputs can be closely corroborated with publicly available information, the fair values are classified as Level 2. If they cannot be corroborated, the fair values are classified as Level 3. As of

December 31, 2015

, fair values of

$15 million

were classified as Level 2, while the remaining balance of

$531 million

was classified as Level 3. As of December 31,


, all private placements were classified as Level 3.

The fair values for each class of security and by valuation hierarchy level are indicated in

Note 4—Investments

under the caption

Fair value measurements.

Fair Value Measurements, Other Financial Instruments

:

Fair values for cash, short-term investments, short-term debt, receivables and payables approximate carrying value. Policy loans are an integral part of Torchmark’s subsidiaries’ life insurance policies in force and their fair values cannot be valued separately and apart from the insurance contracts. The fair values of Torchmark’s long-term debt issues are based on the same methodology as investments in fixed maturities. Because observable inputs were available for these debt securities at

December 31, 2015

, they were classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. The fair value for each debt instrument as of

December 31, 2015

is disclosed in

Note 11—Debt

.

As described in

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

, Torchmark maintains an unqualified supplemental retirement plan. Therefore the assets which support the liability for this plan are considered general assets of the Company. These assets consist of the cash value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and exchange traded funds (ETFs). The fair value of the insurance cash values approximates carrying value. Fair values for the ETFs are derived from direct quotes and are considered Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy.

Impairment of Investments

:

Torchmark’s portfolio of fixed maturities fluctuates in value due to changes in interest rates in the financial markets as well as other factors. Fluctuations caused by market interest rate changes have little bearing on whether or not the investment will be ultimately recoverable. Therefore, Torchmark considers these declines in value resulting from changes in market interest rates to be temporary. In certain circumstances, however, Torchmark determines that the decline in the value of a security is other-than-temporary and writes the book value of the security down to its fair value, realizing an investment loss. The evaluation of Torchmark’s securities for other-than-temporary



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

impairments is a process that is undertaken at least quarterly and is overseen by a team of Company investment and accounting professionals. Each security which is impaired because the fair value is less than the cost or amortized cost is identified and evaluated. The determination that an impairment is other-than-temporary is highly subjective and involves the careful consideration of many factors. Among the factors considered are:

•

The length of time and extent to which the security has been impaired

•

The reason(s) for the impairment

•

The financial condition of the issuer and the near-term prospects for recovery in fair value of the security

•

The Company’s ability and intent to hold the security until anticipated recovery

•

Expected future cash flows

The relative weight given to each of these factors can change over time as facts and circumstances change. In many cases, management believes it is appropriate to give relatively more weight to prospective factors than to retrospective factors. Prospective factors that are given more weight include prospects for recovery, the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security until anticipated recovery, and expected future cash flows.

Among the facts and information considered in the process are:

•

Default on a required payment

•

Issuer bankruptcy filings

•

Financial statements of the issuer

•

Changes in credit ratings of the issuer

•

The value of underlying collateral

•

News and information included in press releases issued by the issuer

•

News and information reported in the media concerning the issuer

•

News and information published by or otherwise provided by credit analysts

•

The nature and amount of recent and expected future sources and uses of cash

While all available information is taken into account, it is difficult to predict the ultimately recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security. If a security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and is treated as a realized loss in the period the determination is made. The written-down security will be amortized and revenue recognized in accordance with estimated future cash flows.

Current accounting guidance is such that if an entity intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired security prior to recovery of its cost basis, the security is to be considered other-than-temporarily impaired and the full amount of impairment must be charged to earnings. Otherwise, losses on fixed maturities which are other-than-temporarily impaired are separated into two categories, the portion of loss which is considered credit loss and the portion of loss which is due to other factors. The credit loss portion is charged to earnings while the loss due to other factors is charged to other comprehensive income. The credit loss portion of an impairment is determined as the difference between the security’s amortized cost and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the security’s original effective yield rate. The temporary portion is the difference between this present value of expected future cash flows and fair value (as discounted by a market yield). The expected cash flows are determined using judgment and the best information available to the Company. Inputs used to derive expected cash flows include expected default rates, current levels of subordination, and loan-to-collateral value ratios. Management believes that the present value of future cash flows at the original effective yield is a better measure of valuation because fair value determined by a discounted market yield is often based on limited observable market data, and the market for these securities is generally neither active nor orderly.

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Cash

:

Cash consists of balances on hand and on deposit in banks and financial institutions. Overdrafts arising from the overnight investment of funds offset cash balances on hand and on deposit.

Other Receivables:

Other receivables consist primarily of agent debit balances, which represent commissions advanced to insurance agents. These balances are repaid to the Company over time as the premiums are collected by the Company and agents' commissions on such premiums are retained. The balance was

$334 million

and

$313 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. Management believes these balances are recoverable as they are less than the estimated present value of future commissions.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

: Certain costs of acquiring new insurance business are deferred and recorded as an asset. These costs are essential for the acquisition of new insurance business and are directly related to the successful issuance of an insurance contract including sales commissions, policy issue costs, and underwriting costs. Additionally, deferred acquisition costs include the value of insurance purchased, which are the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies. These costs represent the difference between the fair value of the contractual insurance assets acquired and liabilities assumed compared against the assets and liabilities for insurance contracts that the Company issues or holds measured in accordance with GAAP. Deferred acquisition costs and the value of insurance purchased are amortized in a systematic manner which matches these costs with the associated revenues. Policies other than universal life-type policies are amortized with interest over the estimated premium-paying period of the policies in a manner which charges each year’s operations in proportion to the receipt of premium income. Universal life-type policies are amortized with interest in proportion to estimated gross profits. The assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs with regard to interest, mortality, morbidity, and persistency are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits. For interest-sensitive and deposit-balance type products, these assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations. For all other products, amortization assumptions are generally not revised once established. Deferred acquisition costs are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing to determine if there is a premium deficiency. These tests evaluate whether the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized deferred acquisition cost asset. These cash flows consist primarily of premium income, less benefits and expenses taking inflation into account. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is then compared with the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance. In the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less, the deficiency would be recognized by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future benefits, as described under the caption

Future Policy Benefits

.

Advertising Costs

: Costs related to advertising are generally charged to expense as incurred. However, certain Globe Life Direct Response advertising costs are capitalized when there is a reliable and demonstrated relationship between total costs and future benefits that is a direct result of incurring these costs. Globe Life Direct Response advertising costs consist primarily of the production and distribution costs of direct mail advertising materials, and when capitalized are included as a component of deferred acquisition costs. They are amortized in the same manner as other deferred acquisition costs. Globe Life Direct Response advertising costs charged to earnings and included in other operating expense were

$10 million

,

$8 million

, and

$6 million

in


,


, and


, respectively. Capitalized advertising costs included within deferred acquisition costs were

$1.21 billion

at

December 31, 2015

and

$1.15 billion

at

December 31, 2014

.

Goodwill

:

The excess cost of business acquired over the fair value of net assets acquired is reported as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing based on certain procedures outlined by GAAP. These procedures include a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, and they also require consideration of a change in relevant events or circumstances that could possibly affect the valuation of a goodwill reporting unit. If it is determined that an impairment is likely, the procedures then involve measuring the carrying value of each reporting unit of Torchmark’s segments, including the goodwill of that unit, against the estimated fair value of the corresponding unit. If the carrying value of a unit including goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, then the goodwill in that unit could potentially be impaired. In that event, further testing is required under the accounting guidance



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

to determine the amount of impairment, if any. If there is an impairment in the goodwill of any reporting unit, it is written down and charged to earnings in the period of test.

Torchmark tested its goodwill annually in each of the years


through


. These tests, performed in the second quarter each year, involved assigning carrying value by allocating the Company’s net assets to each of the reporting units of Torchmark’s segments, including the portion of goodwill assigned to the unit. In


, the qualitative assessment was employed as permitted by accounting guidance. Based on the analyses as outlined in the guidance, it was determined that an impairment of goodwill was not likely. In both 2014 and 2013, the fair values of the various reporting units were developed. The fair value of each reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows associated with that unit. Judgment and assumptions are used in developing the projected cash flows for the reporting units, and such estimates are subject to change. The Company also exercises judgment in the determination of the discount rate, which management believes to be appropriate for the risk associated with the cash flow expectations. The fair value of each reporting unit is then measured against that reporting unit’s corresponding carrying value. Because the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value, including goodwill, of each reporting unit in each period, Torchmark’s goodwill was not impaired in any of those periods.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests

:

Torchmark invests in limited partnerships that provide low-income housing tax credits and other related federal income tax and state premium tax benefits to Torchmark. The carrying value of Torchmark’s investment in these entities was

$306 million

and

$318 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. At

December 31, 2015

,

$302 million

associated with the federal interests was included in "Other assets" on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets

with the remaining

$4 million

state-related interests included in "Other long-term investments". At December 31,


, the comparable amounts were

$313 million

, and

$5 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2015

, Torchmark was obligated under future commitments of

$69 million

, which is included in the above carrying value. Torchmark accounts for the amortization of these tax benefits in accordance with the new guidance discussed below.

On January 1, 2015, Torchmark adopted new guidance concerning

Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects

(ASU 2014-01). The guidance replaces the effective-yield method of amortization with respect to investments in qualified affordable housing acquired after the date of adoption and, if certain conditions are present, provides for a proportional amortization method.

Under the proportional amortization method, the investor amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits received during the current period to the total expected tax credits to be received over the life of the investment.

The guidance further provides that a company which previously used the effective-yield method of amortization may continue to use such method with respect to investments acquired before the date of adoption. Amortization, previously required to be recognized in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

as a component of "Net investment income", is now included in "Income tax expense."

Torchmark continues to use the effective-yield method of amortization with respect to its guaranteed investments acquired prior to January 1, 2015, and has retrospectively adopted the new guidance and applied the proportional method of amortization with respect to its non-guaranteed investments. The proportional method of amortization is consistent with Torchmark’s historical method of amortization. As a result, the only impact of the adoption is the reclassification of amortization expense from “Net investment income” to “Income tax expense” with no impact on Torchmark's historical net income, cash flows, or statutory earnings of its insurance subsidiaries.

for the twelve months ended December 31,


and


.

(1) Total revenue, income before income taxes, and income taxes were adjusted for discontinued operations as discussed earlier in this note.

Property and Equipment

:

Property and equipment, included in “Other assets,” is reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is recorded primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets which range from

three

to

ten

years for equipment and

five

to

forty

years for buildings and improvements. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Impairments, if any, are recorded when certain events and circumstances become evident that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Original cost of property and equipment was

$175 million

at

December 31, 2015

and

$139 million

at

December 31, 2014

. Accumulated depreciation was

. During 2013, Liberty National Life Insurance Company (Liberty National), a Torchmark subsidiary, sold real estate for a loss of

$265 thousand

after a previous write-down for other-than-temporary impairment of

$2.7 million

earlier in the year. The sale of this property eliminated substantially all asbestos-related liability for Torchmark.

Future Policy Benefits

:

The liability for future policy benefits for universal life-type products is represented by policy account value. The liability for future policy benefits for all other life and health products, approximately

85%

of total future policy benefits, is determined on the net level premium method. This method provides for the present value of expected future benefit payments less the present value of expected future net premiums, based on estimated investment yields, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other assumptions which were considered appropriate at the time the policies were issued. For limited-payment contracts, a deferred profit liability is also recorded which causes profits to emerge over the life of the contract in proportion to policies in force. Assumptions used for traditional life and health insurance products are based primarily on Company experience. Assumptions for interest rates range from

2.5%

to

7.0%

for Torchmark’s insurance companies with an overall weighted average assumed rate of

5.7%

. Mortality tables used for individual life insurance include various statutory tables and modifications of a variety of generally accepted actuarial tables. Morbidity assumptions for individual health are based on Company experience and industry data. Withdrawal and termination assumptions are based on Torchmark’s experience. Once established, assumptions for these products are generally not changed. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions. These estimates are reviewed annually and compared with actual experience. If it is determined that existing contract liabilities, together with the present value of future gross premiums, will not be



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits and to recover unamortized deferred acquisition costs, then a premium deficiency exists. Such a deficiency would be recognized immediately by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized deferred acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future policy benefits. From that point forward, the liability for future policy benefits would be based on revised assumptions.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable

:

Torchmark establishes a liability for known policy benefits payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Torchmark makes an estimate of unreported claims after careful evaluation of all information available to the Company. This estimate is based on prior experience and is reviewed quarterly. However, there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, will be Torchmark’s ultimate obligation.

Postretirement Benefits

:

Torchmark accounts for its postretirement defined benefit plans by recognizing the funded status of those plans on its

Consolidated Balance Sheets

in accordance with accounting guidance. Periodic gains and losses attributable to changes in plan assets and liabilities that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are recognized as components of other comprehensive income, net of tax. More information concerning the accounting and disclosures for postretirement benefits is found in

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

.

Income Taxes

:

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement book values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. More information concerning income taxes is provided in

Note 8—Income Taxes

.

Treasury Stock

:

Torchmark accounts for purchases of treasury stock on the cost method. Issuance of treasury stock is accounted for using the weighted-average cost method. More information is found in

Note 12—Shareholders' Equity

.

Recognition of Premium Revenue and Related Expenses

:

Premium income for traditional long-duration life and health insurance products is recognized when due from the policyholder. Premiums for short-duration health contracts are recognized as revenue over the contract period in proportion to the insurance protection provided. Profits for limited-payment life insurance contracts are recognized over the contract period. Premiums for universal life-type and annuity contracts are added to the policy account value, and revenues for such products are recognized as charges to the policy account value for mortality, administration, and surrenders (retrospective deposit method). Life premium includes policy charges of

$19 million

,

$21 million

, and

$22 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


, and


, respectively. Other premium consists of annuity policy charges in each year. Profits are also earned to the extent that investment income exceeds policy liability interest requirements. The related benefits and expenses are matched with revenues by means of the provision of future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in a manner which recognizes profits as they are earned over the same period.

Stock-Based Compensation

:

Torchmark accounts for stock-based compensation by recognizing an expense in the financial statements based on the “fair value method.” The fair value method requires that a fair value be assigned to a stock option or other stock grant on its grant date and that this value be amortized over the grantees’ service period.

The fair value method requires the use of an option valuation model to value employee stock options. Torchmark has elected to use the Black-Scholes valuation model for option expensing. A summary of assumptions for options granted in each of the three years


through


is as follows:



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The expected term is generally derived from Company experience. However, expected terms are determined based on the simplified method as permitted under the ASC 718

Stock Compensation

topic when company experience is insufficient. The Torchmark Corporation 2011 Incentive Plan replaced all previous plans and allows for option grants for employees with a

ten

-year contractual term which vest over

five

years in addition to

seven

-year grants which vest over

three

years as permitted by the previous plans. Director grants vest over

six

months. The Company has sufficient experience with seven-year grants that vest in three years, but insufficient historical experience with five-year vesting. Therefore, Torchmark has used the simplified method to determine the expected term for the ten-year grants with five-year vesting and will do so until adequate experience is developed. Volatility and risk-free interest rates are assumed over a period of time consistent with the expected term of the option. Volatility is measured on a historical basis. Monthly data points are utilized to derive volatility for periods greater than three years. Expected dividend yield is based on current dividend yield held constant over the expected term. Once the fair value of an option has been determined, it is amortized on a straight-line basis over the employee’s service period for that grant (from the grant date to the date the grant is fully vested). Expenses for restricted stock and restricted stock units are based on the grant-date fair value allocated on a straight-line basis over the service period. Performance share expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the probability of meeting the metrics identified in the performance share award agreement, assigned to each service period as these estimates develop.

Torchmark management views all stock-based compensation expense as a corporate or Parent Company expense and, therefore, presents it as such in its segment analysis (See

Note 14—Business Segments

). It is included in “Other operating expense” in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

.

Earnings Per Share

:

Torchmark presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

for income from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adding to shares outstanding the additional net effect of potentially dilutive securities or contracts, such as stock options, which could be exercised or converted into common shares. For more information on earnings per share, see

(ASU 2015-09)

,

requiring companies to disclose additional information with regards to its short-duration insurance contracts. These new disclosures are intended to provide additional insight into an insurance entity’s ability to underwrite claims. Torchmark's disclosures under ASU 2015-09 will be effective for the 2016 annual consolidated financial statements. This guidance consists only of new disclosures and will not impact the accounting for short-duration contracts.

Financial Instruments:

The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01

Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(ASU 2016-01). The guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. In particular, this guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than other comprehensive income, and changes the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for Torchmark on January 1, 2018. As Torchmark's equity securities portfolio is insignificant in comparison to its investment portfolio, the Company does not anticipate the guidance to have a material impact on its operating results.

Leases:

The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02

Leases

(ASU 2016-02). This new guidance states that leases classified as operating leases under current accounting guidance will be recognized on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities when the company is the lessee. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for Torchmark on January 1, 2019 and is required to be presented using a modified retrospective approach. Torchmark is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2—Statutory Accounting

Life insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are required to file statutory financial statements with state insurance regulatory authorities. Accounting principles used to prepare these statutory financial statements differ from GAAP. Consolidated net income and shareholders’ equity (capital and surplus) on a statutory basis for the insurance subsidiaries were as follows:

The excess, if any, of shareholder’s equity of the insurance subsidiaries on a GAAP basis over that determined on a statutory basis is not available for distribution by the insurance subsidiaries to Torchmark without regulatory approval. Insurance subsidiaries’ statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements in the aggregate was

$452 million

at

December 31, 2015

. More information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends can be found in

Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity

.

Torchmark’s statutory financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting practices prescribed by the insurance department of the state of domicile of each insurance subsidiary. All states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) statutory accounting practices (NAIC SAP) as the basis for statutory accounting. However, certain states have retained the prescribed practices of their respective insurance code or administrative code which can differ from NAIC SAP. There are no significant differences between NAIC SAP and the accounting practices prescribed by the states of domicile for Torchmark’s life insurance companies that affect statutory surplus.

Quantitative Information about Level 3

Fair Value Measurements

As of

December 31, 2015

The collateral underlying collateralized debt obligations for which fair values are reported as Level 3 consists primarily of trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. None of the collateral is subprime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). Collateralized debt obligations are valued at the present value of expected future cash flows using an unobservable discount rate. Expected cash flows are determined by scheduling the projected repayment of the collateral assuming no future defaults, deferrals, or recoveries. The discount rate is risk-adjusted to take these items into account. A significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate will produce a significant decrease (increase) in fair value. Additionally, a significant increase (decrease) in the cash flow expectations would result in a significant increase (decrease) in fair value.

The private placement fixed maturities are valued based on the contractual cash flows discounted by a yield determined as a treasury benchmark adjusted for a credit spread. The credit spread is developed from observable indices for similar public fixed maturities and unobservable indices for private fixed maturities for corresponding credit ratings. However, the credit ratings for the private placements are considered unobservable inputs, as they are assigned by the third party investment manager based on a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit underwritten. A higher (lower) credit rating would result in a higher (lower) valuation. For more information regarding valuation procedures, please refer to

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

under the caption

Fair Value Measurements, Investments in Securities

.

The following table presents transfers in and out of each of the valuation levels of fair values.

Transfers into Level 2 from Level 3 result from the availability of observable market data when a security is valued at the end of a period. Transfers into Level 3 occur when there is a lack of observable market information. Transfers into Level 1 from Level 2 occur when direct quotes are available; transfers from Level 1 into Level 2 result when only observable market data and no direct quotes are available. Transfers between levels are recognized as of the end of the period of transfer.

, Torchmark met the criteria to account for its Medicare Part D business as a discontinued operation and expects the business to be sold during 2016. Historically, the business was a reportable segment. However, Torchmark no longer emphasizes its Medicare Part D business due to declining margins, increased risks, higher drug costs, and increased administrative and compliance costs.

Activity in the liability for unpaid health claims is summarized as follows:

At the end of each period, the liability for unpaid health claims includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Such estimates are updated regularly based upon the Company’s most recent claims data with recognition of emerging experience trends. Because of the nature of the Company’s health business, the payment lags are relatively short and most claims are fully paid within a year from the time incurred. Fluctuations in claims experience can lead to either over or under estimation of the liability for any given year. The difference between the estimate made at the end of the prior period and the actual experience during the period is reflected above under the caption “Incurred related to: Prior years.”

The liability for unpaid health claims is included with “Policy claims and other benefits payable” on the

"Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests"

the Company adopted ASU 2014-01 as of January 1, 2015. As a result of the adoption, amortization of the cost component for certain investments in low-income affordable housing projects were reclassified from net investment income to income taxes. The reclassification adjustment has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented.

The components of income taxes were as follows:

Income tax expense from continuing operations consists of:

In each of the years

, deferred income tax expense was incurred because of certain differences between net income before income taxes as reported on the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

and taxable income as reported on Torchmark’s income tax returns. As explained in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

these differences caused the financial statement book values of some assets and liabilities to be different from their respective tax bases.

The effective income tax rate differed from the expected 35% rate as shown below:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 8—Income Taxes (continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below:

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, excluding Family Heritage Life Insurance Company (Family Heritage), file a life-nonlife consolidated federal income tax return. Family Heritage files its federal income tax return on a separate company basis. Torchmark’s consolidated federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS completed its examination of Torchmark’s 2008-2011 consolidated income tax returns during 2014 resulting in no impact on the company’s effective tax rate. The statutes of limitations for the assessment of additional tax are closed for all tax years prior to 2012 with respect to Torchmark’s consolidated and Family Heritage’s federal income tax returns. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any potential assessments that may result from current or future tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open years.

Torchmark has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately

$6.3 million

at

December 31, 2015

which will begin to expire in 2032 if not otherwise used to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is to be provided when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized by the Company. No valuation allowance has been recorded relating to Torchmark’s deferred tax assets as management believes Torchmark will more likely than not have sufficient taxable income in future periods to fully realize its existing deferred tax assets.

Torchmark’s tax liability is adjusted to include a provision for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. However, during the years


through


, Torchmark did not have any uncertain tax positions which resulted in unrecognized tax benefits.

Torchmark’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company recognized interest income of

$11 thousand

,

$465 thousand

, and

$0 thousand

, net of federal income tax benefits, in its

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

Pension Plans

:

Torchmark has noncontributory retirement benefit plans and contributory savings plans which cover substantially all employees. There are also

two

nonqualified, noncontributory supplemental benefit pension plans which cover a limited number of employees. The total cost of these retirement plans charged to operations was as follows:

Torchmark accrues expense for the defined contribution plans based on a percentage of the employees’ contributions. The plans are funded by the employee contributions and a Torchmark contribution equal to the amount of accrued expense. Plan contributions are both mandatory and discretionary, depending on the terms of the plan.

Cost for the defined benefit pension plans has been calculated on the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. All plan measurements for the defined benefit plans are as of December 31 of the respective year. The defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of employees are qualified and funded. Contributions are made to funded pension plans subject to minimums required by regulation and maximums allowed for tax purposes. Defined benefit plan contributions were

$15.5 million

in


,

$14.6 million

in


, and

$10.3 million

in


. Torchmark estimates as of

December 31, 2015

that it will contribute an amount not to exceed

$20 million

to these plans in


. The actual amount of contribution may be different from this estimate.

Torchmark has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), which provides to a limited number of executives an additional supplemental defined pension benefit. The supplemental benefit is based on the participant’s qualified plan benefit without consideration to the regulatory limits on compensation and benefit payments applicable to qualified plans, except that eligible compensation is capped at

$1 million

. The SERP is unqualified and unfunded. However, a Rabbi Trust has been established to support the liability for this plan. This trust consists of life insurance policies on the lives of plan participants with an unaffiliated insurance carrier as well as an investment account. The premiums paid for the insurance coverage were

$10.1 million

in


,

$2.2 million

in


, and

$2.9 million

in


. The cash value of these policies at

December 31, 2015

was

and was

$24 million

a year earlier. Investments in the investment account consist of ETFs. Deposits of

$6 million

in


were added to the investment account in this trust. There were

no

deposits in


or


. As of

December 31, 2015

, the combined value of the insurance policies and the trust investments was

$79 million

, compared with

$74 million

a year earlier. Because this plan is unqualified, the investments and the policyholder value of the insurance policies in the Rabbi Trust are not included as defined benefit plan assets but as assets of the Company. They are included with “Other Assets” in the

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. The liability for this SERP at

December 31, 2015

was

$67 million

and was

$71 million

a year earlier.

The Company has another small supplemental benefit pension plan which is limited to a very select group of employees and was closed as of December 31, 1994. It provides the full benefits that an employee would have otherwise received from a defined benefit plan in the absence of the limitation on benefits payable under a qualified plan. This plan is unfunded. Liability for this closed plan was

$3 million

at

December 31, 2015

and

December 31, 2014

. Pension cost for both supplemental defined benefit plans is determined in the same manner as for the qualified defined benefit plans.

Pension Assets by Component at

December 31, 2014

(1) This amount represents a guaranteed annuity contract issued by Torchmark's subsidiary, American Income Life Insurance Company, to fund the obligations of the American Income Pension Plan.

Torchmark’s investment objectives for its plan assets include preservation of capital, preservation of purchasing power, and long-term growth. Torchmark seeks to preserve capital through investments made in high quality securities with adequate diversification by issuer and industry sector to minimize risk. The portfolio is monitored continuously for changes in quality and diversification mix. The preservation of purchasing power is intended to be accomplished through asset growth, exclusive of contributions and withdrawals, in excess of the rate of inflation. Torchmark intends to maintain investments that when combined with future plan contributions will produce adequate long-term growth to provide for all plan obligations. It is also Torchmark’s objective that the portfolio’s investment return will meet or exceed the return of a balanced market index.

The majority of the securities in the portfolio are highly marketable so that there will be adequate liquidity to meet projected payments. There are no specific policies calling for asset durations to match those of benefit obligations.

Allowed investments are limited to equities, fixed maturities, and short-term investments (invested cash). The assets are to be invested in a mix of equity and fixed income investments that best serve the objectives of the pension plan. Factors to be considered in determining the asset mix include funded status, annual pension expense, annual pension contributions, and balance sheet liability. Equities include common and preferred stocks, securities convertible into equities, mutual funds that invest in equities, and other equity-related investments. Equities must be listed on major exchanges and adequate market liquidity is required. Fixed maturities consist of marketable debt securities rated investment grade at purchase by a major rating agency. Short-term investments include fixed maturities with maturities

less than one year and invested cash. Short-term investments in commercial paper must be rated at least A-2 by Standard & Poor’s with the issuer rated investment grade. Invested cash is limited to banks rated A or higher. Investments outside of the aforementioned list are not permitted, except by prior approval of the Plan’s Trustees. At

December 31, 2015

, there were no restricted investments contained in the portfolio. Plan contributions have been invested primarily in fixed maturity and equity securities during the three years ended December 31, 2015.

The investment portfolio is to be well diversified to avoid undue exposure to a single sector, industry, business, or security. The equity and fixed maturity portfolios are not permitted to invest in any single issuer that would exceed

10%

of total plan assets at the time of purchase. Torchmark does not employ any other special risk management techniques, such as derivatives, in managing the pension investment portfolio.

The following table discloses the assumptions used to determine Torchmark’s pension liabilities and costs for the appropriate periods. The discount and compensation increase rates are used to determine current year projected benefit obligations and subsequent year pension expense. The long-term rate of return is used to determine current year expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are included in actuarial gain or loss.

Weighted Average Pension Plan Assumptions

The discount rate is determined based on the expected duration of plan liabilities. A yield is then derived based on the current market yield of a hypothetical portfolio of higher-quality corporate bonds which match the liability duration. The rate of compensation increase is projected based on Company experience, modified as appropriate for future expectations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is management’s best estimate of the average rate of earnings expected to be received on the assets invested in the plan over the benefit period. In determining this assumption, consideration is given to the historical rate of return earned on the assets, the projected returns over future periods, and the discount rate used to compute benefit obligations.

Net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit plans by expense component was as follows:

Torchmark has estimated its expected pension benefits to be paid over the next ten years as of

. These estimates use the same assumptions that measure the benefit obligation at December 31, 2014, taking estimated future employee service into account. Those estimated benefits are as follows:

Postretirement Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions

:

Torchmark provides a small postretirement life insurance benefit for most retired employees, and also provides additional postretirement life insurance benefits for certain key employees. The majority of the life insurance benefits are accrued over the working lives of active employees. Otherwise, Torchmark does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions and the life insurance benefits described above.

Torchmark’s post-retirement defined benefit plans other than pensions are not funded. Liabilities for these plans are measured as of December 31 for the appropriate year.

Commercial Paper

:

As of July 16, 2014, Torchmark entered into a new credit facility with a group of lenders allowing for unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to

$750 million

, replacing a previous facility that had a maximum limitation of

$600 million

. Up to

$250 million

in letters of credit can be issued against the new facility. The facility is further designated as a back-up credit line for a commercial paper program under which the Company may either borrow from the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time, with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility maximum, less any letters of credit issued. Interest is charged at variable rates. The facility has no ratings-based acceleration triggers which would require early repayment prior to the termination date of

July 16, 2019

. In accordance with the agreement, Torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization, as was the case with the previous credit facility. As of

December 31, 2015

, and throughout the three-year period ended

December 31, 2015

Note 13—Stock-Based Compensation

Torchmark’s stock-based compensation consists of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares. Certain employees, directors, and consultants have been granted fixed equity options to buy shares of Torchmark stock at the market value of the stock on the date of grant, under the provisions of the Torchmark stock option plans. The options are exercisable during the period commencing from the date they vest until expiring according to the terms of the grant. Options generally expire the earlier of employee termination or option contract term, which ranges from

seven

to

ten

years. Options generally vest in accordance with the following schedule:

All employee options vest immediately upon retirement on or after the attainment of age 65, upon death, or disability. Torchmark generally issues shares for the exercise of stock options from treasury stock. The Company generally uses the proceeds from option exercises to buy shares of Torchmark common stock in the open market to reduce the dilution from option exercises.

Restricted Stock:

Restricted stock grants consist of time-vested grants, restricted stock units, and performance shares. Time-vested restricted stock is available to both senior executives and directors. The employee grants generally vest over

five

years and the director grants vest over

six

months. Restricted stock units are available only to directors. They vest over

six

months and are not converted to shares until the directors’ retirement, death, or disability. Director restricted stock and restricted stock units are generally granted on the first work day of the year. Performance shares are granted to a limited number of senior executives. Performance shares have a

three

year contract life and are not settled in shares until the termination of the three-year contract period. While the grant specifies a stated target number of shares, the determination of the actual settlement in shares will be based on the achievement of certain performance objectives of Torchmark over the respective three-year contract periods. The actual shares could be distributed in a range from


to

359 thousand

shares for the


grants,

Time-vested restricted stock holders, both employees and directors, are entitled to dividend payments on the unvested stock. Restricted stock unit holders are entitled to dividend equivalents. These equivalents are granted in the form of additional restricted stock units and vest immediately upon grant. Dividend equivalents are applicable only to restricted stock units. Performance shareholders are not entitled to dividend equivalents and are not entitled to dividend payments until the shares are vested and settled.

Note 14—Business Segments

Torchmark’s reportable segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance, health insurance, and annuities. These major product lines are set out as reportable segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management techniques. There is also an investment segment which manages the investment portfolio, debt, and cash flow for the insurance segments and the corporate function. Torchmark's chief operating decision makers evaluate the overall performance of the operations of the Company in accordance with these segments.

Life insurance products include traditional and interest-sensitive whole life insurance as well as term life insurance. Health insurance products are generally guaranteed-renewable and include Medicare Supplement, critical illness, accident, long-term care, and limited-benefit supplemental hospital and surgical coverages. Annuities include fixed-benefit contracts.

Torchmark markets its insurance products through a number of distribution channels, each of which sells the products of one or more of Torchmark’s insurance segments. The tables below present segment premium revenue by each of Torchmark’s marketing groups.

Note 14—Business Segments (continued)

Due to the nature of the life insurance industry, Torchmark has no individual or group which would be considered a major customer. Substantially all of Torchmark’s business is conducted in the United States.

The measure of profitability established by the chief operating decision makers for insurance segments is underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses, in accordance with the manner the segments are managed. It essentially represents gross profit margin on insurance products before insurance administrative expenses and consists of premium, less net policy obligations, acquisition expenses, and commissions. Interest credited to net policy liabilities (reserves less deferred acquisition costs) is reflected as a component of the Investment segment in order to match this cost to the investment earnings from the assets supporting the net policy liabilities.

The measure of profitability for the Investment segment is excess investment income, which represents the income earned on the investment portfolio in excess of net policy requirements and financing costs associated with Torchmark’s debt. Other than the above-mentioned interest allocations and an intersegment commission, there are no other intersegment revenues or expenses. Expenses directly attributable to corporate operations are included in the “Corporate” category. Stock-based compensation expense is considered a corporate expense by Torchmark management and is included in this category. All other unallocated revenues and expenses on a pretax basis, including insurance administrative expense, are included in the “Other” segment category.

Torchmark holds a sizeable investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities, the yield from which is used to offset policy benefit, acquisition, administrative and tax expenses. This yield or investment income is taken into account when establishing premium rates and profitability expectations of its insurance products. In holding such a portfolio, investments are sold, called, or written down from time to time, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains or losses generally occur as a result of disposition due to issuer calls, compliance with Company investment policies, or other reasons often beyond management’s control. Unlike investment income, realized gains and losses are incidental to insurance operations, and only overall yields are considered when setting premium rates or insurance product profitability expectations. While these gains and losses are not relevant to segment profitability or core operating results, they can have a material positive or negative result on net income. For these reasons, management removes realized investment gains and losses when it views its segment operations.

In


, Torchmark recorded

$1.4 million

$522 thousand

. Management removes items that are related to prior periods when evaluating the operating results of current periods. Management also removes non-operating items unrelated to its core insurance activities when evaluating those results. Therefore, these items are excluded in its presentation of segment results, because accounting guidance requires that operating segment results be presented as management views its business. With the exception of the administrative settlements in the paragraph above, all of these items are included in “Other operating expense” in the

Analysis of Profitability by Segment

(1) Income from discontinued operations (after tax) is included for purposes of reconciling to net income.

Assets for each segment are reported based on a specific identification basis. The insurance segments’ assets contain deferred acquisition costs (including the value of insurance purchased). The investment segment includes the investment portfolio, cash, and accrued investment income. Goodwill is assigned to the insurance segments at the time of purchase based on the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired for the benefit of that segment. All other assets are included in the Other category. The table below reconciles segment assets to total assets as reported in the consolidated financial statements.

, total remaining undiscounted payments under the leases were approximately

$19 million

. The Torchmark  parent company would be responsible for any subsidiary obligation in the event the subsidiary did not make payments or otherwise perform under the terms of the lease.

Unclaimed Property Audits

:

Torchmark subsidiaries are currently the subject of audits regarding the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed property arising from life insurance policies and a limited number of annuity contracts. These audits are being conducted by private entities that have contracted with forty-seven various states through their respective Departments of Revenue, and have not resulted in any financial assessment from any state nor indicated any liability. The audits are wide-ranging and seek large amounts of data regarding claims handling, procedures, and payments of contract benefits arising from unreported death claims. No estimate of range can be made at this time for loss contingencies related to possible administrative penalties or amounts that could be payable to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property.

Sanction

: During the third quarter of 2015, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) placed United American Life Insurance Company (UA) and First United American Life Insurance Company (FUA) on Enrollment Sanction. During this time, Torchmark is not permitted to enroll new individuals or groups into our Medicare Part D program. Torchmark is permitted to re-enroll existing individual members into our 2016 plans, as well as enroll new members of groups that were policyholders at the time the sanction was initiated. Torchmark has submitted a remediation plan that has been accepted by CMS, and Torchmark is proceeding with this plan in an effort to have the sanction lifted as soon as possible. As discussed in

Note 6—Discontinued Operations

, the Medicare Part D business is held for sale and reflected in discontinued operations.

Litigation

:

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark’s financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit.

With respect to its current litigation, at this time management believes that the possibility of a material judgment adverse to Torchmark is remote, and no estimate of range can be made for loss contingencies that are at least reasonably possible but not accrued.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

No disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure have been reported on a Form 8-K within the twenty-four months prior to the date of the most recent financial statements.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

Torchmark, under the direction of the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Torchmark in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to Torchmark’s management, including the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

As of the end of the fiscal year completed

December 31, 2015

, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of Torchmark management, including the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of Torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures (as those terms are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon their evaluation, the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this Form 10-K. In compliance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C. § 1350), each of these officers executed a Certification included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

As of the quarter ended

December 31, 2015

, there have not been any changes in Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect this control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of their evaluation which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting. No material weaknesses in such internal controls were identified in the evaluation and as a consequence, no corrective action was required to be taken.

Item 9B.  Other Information

There were no items required.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management at Torchmark Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis. As a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting, the Company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

Management evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and based on its assessment, determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2015

. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein.

Index to Financial Statements

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Torchmark Corporation

McKinney, Texas

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries (Torchmark) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Torchmark's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Torchmark's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Torchmark maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of Torchmark and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
