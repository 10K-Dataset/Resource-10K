Insurance

Life Insurance

Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries write a variety of nonparticipating ordinary life insurance products. These include traditional and interest sensitive whole-life insurance, term life insurance, and other life insurance. The following tables present selected information about Torchmark’s life products.

The distribution methods for life insurance products include direct response, exclusive agents, and independent agents. These methods are described in more depth in the primary marketing distribution method chart earlier in this report. The following table presents life annualized premium in force by distribution method.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


Health Insurance

Torchmark offers Medicare Supplement and limited-benefit supplemental health insurance products that include primarily critical illness and accident plans. These policies are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own. Medicare Supplements are offered to enrollees in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. Medicare Supplement plans are standardized by federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles and co-payments not paid by Medicare.

The following table presents supplemental health annualized premium in force information for the three years ended

December 31, 2018

by product category.

The following table presents supplemental health annualized premium in force for the three years ended

December 31, 2018

by distribution method.

Annuities

Annuity products include single-premium and flexible-premium deferred annuities. Annuities in each of the three years ended

December 31, 2018

comprised less than 1% of premium.

Pricing

Premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, investment income, expenses, and target profit margins. These assumptions are based on Company experience and projected investment earnings. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products. Profitability is affected by actual experience deviations from the pricing assumptions and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves.

Collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues, but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


Underwriting

The underwriting standards of each Torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, including, but not limited to inspection reports, pharmacy data, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage, or rejected.

Reserves

The life insurance policy reserves reflected in Torchmark’s consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These reserves, with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. The assumptions used in the calculation of Torchmark’s reserves are reported in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

.

Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments.

Investments

The nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Approximately

95%

of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities at

Competition

Torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance companies competing with Torchmark, no individual company dominates any of Torchmark’s life or health markets.

Torchmark’s health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements.

Management believes Torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows Torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.

Regulation

Insurance.

Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. They are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.

Risk-Based Capital (RBC).

The NAIC requires that a risk-based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk-based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. All Torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk-based capital formula.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


Guaranty Assessments.

State guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used, in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company, to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders. The amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state. A significant portion of assessments are recoverable as offsets against state premium taxes. (See

Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies

for current assessment

.

)

Holding Company.

States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and New York.

Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.

Personnel

At the end of


, Torchmark had 3,102 employees, consistent with the prior year.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

The insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many public and private companies. We operate in the industry's life and health insurance sectors, each of which has its own set of risks.

Operational Risks:

The development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits.

Development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in this market because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higher-income markets. Compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and motivates producing agents to increase sales is also critical. Globe Life Direct Response is continuously developing new methods of reaching consumers and realizing cost efficiencies. Less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits.

Economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We primarily serve the lower-middle to middle-income market for individual life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income. If disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer or stop payment of insurance premiums altogether. Economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under

Investment Risks

below.

Variations in expected-to-actual rates of mortality, morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits. These reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. The reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity and persistency, as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. Even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of policyholder benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. Significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could result in increased policy obligations and negatively affect our profit margins and income.

A ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. A downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through independent insurance agencies.

Rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. These ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of capital. Actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Such an event could limit our access to capital markets, increase the cost of debt, or impair our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.

Ratings reflect only a rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


company’s control. In addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. Changes to the models could impact a rating agency's judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. We cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Life Insurance Marketplace Risk:

Our life insurance products are sold in selected niche markets. We are at risk should any of these markets diminish.

We have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches, two of which are labor unions and sales via Globe Life Direct Response solicitation. Deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business.

Health Insurance Marketplace Risks:

The health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny.

Regulatory changes could impact our Medicare Supplement and other supplemental health business. The nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our health insurance business.

Competition in the health insurance market can be significant.

Sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare to seniors. In addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or underprice new sales in order to gain market share. We choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. Accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products.

Obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical.

A significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from Medicare Supplement insurance. Medicare Supplement insurance, including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased, is highly regulated at both the state and federal level. As a result, our Medicare Supplement business is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. Since Medicare Supplement policies are coordinated with the federal Medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the Medicare Supplement policies are typically necessary. Obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. Accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Information Security and Technology Risks:

The failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the Company could compromise data security, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is highly dependent upon information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner. We gather and maintain data on our information systems, including the identity, health and financial information of our current, former and prospective policyholders, for the purpose of conducting marketing, sales and policy administration functions. This information is highly targeted by malicious threat actors.

Malicious threat actors, employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations, regulatory compliance and financial condition. An attacker could circumvent security measures in order to access, alter or delete data from our systems or to render our systems unavailable for business use. Additionally, we may not become aware of sophisticated cyber-attacks for some time after they occur, thereby increasing the Company's exposure. We may have to incur significant costs to address existing and future regulatory requirements related thereto. These risks are heightened as the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


Employee or agent errors in the handling of our information systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information, or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations.

We may utilize the services of third parties in order to conduct our business. Cyber events affecting these third parties could materially impact our sales and operational efficiency.

We anticipate more frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks along with more impactful regulatory oversight models. An increasing number of states also require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of their confidential information. Any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter potential customers from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, or require us to incur significant technical, legal or other expenses.

In the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees, agents or customers for a period of time.

A disaster or natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, terrorist attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and existing contingency plans cannot function as designed.

Reputational Risk:

Damage to the reputation of Torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business.

Negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. As discussed above in

Information Security and Technology Risks

, the Company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach.

Investment Risks:

Our investments are subject to market and credit risks. Significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses.

Our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades and changes in market values. Our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and short-term investments, where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments. The concentration of these investments in any particular issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic areas increases this risk. Factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels (consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread), financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control.

Additionally, as the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. These declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity. It is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss could be unrecoverable. In that case, the unrealized loss would be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income.

We cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all. Significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades of the Company by rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


Changes in interest rates could negatively affect income.

Declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities. We attempt to manage our investments to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting the discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities. There is a risk that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will prevent us from doing so, thereby having a negative impact on income. Significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. Any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates.

Increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our fixed maturity portfolio to decline. A rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash, thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations. In such a case, realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income, consolidated RBC ratio and results of operations.

Liquidity Risks:

Our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries.

As a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. Moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Other sources of liquidity include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing and reinsurance.

The principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. For example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. Additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries

are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile

. Accordingly, impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow.

Changes in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. Additionally, if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of our health insurance premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities, their profitability, and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted. Limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock.

Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital.

Should interest rates rise in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced. In addition, if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business.

In the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. The availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity. Additionally, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


our business activity were to decrease due to a market downturn. Our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. If so, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected.

Regulatory Risks:

Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth.

Insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business. The primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders, not investors. State agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, agent licensing, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves and permitted investments. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses or approvals. The insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting the Company may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. Should regulatory changes occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of such laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities and/or impose substantial fines.

We cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents, are improper. Such actions could result in substantial fines, penalties and/or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact our profitability.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Record and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO), charged with monitoring systemic risk exposure in all lines of insurance other than health insurance and long-term care insurance, and a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which serves to identify and respond to risks and emerging threats to U.S. financial systems. A Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), established under the Department of Health and Human Services, is charged with overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the ongoing operations of the FIO, FSOC and CCIIO, as well as any other proposals or executive action for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital.

Changes to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products insurers offer, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital, or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products.

Changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP and accounting practices as promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ statutory accounting practices (NAIC SAP), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


recognized authoritative bodies. Future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability.

Non-compliance with laws or regulations related to customer and consumer privacy and information security, including a failure to ensure that our business associates with access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality, could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations.

The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of personally identifiable information by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Noncompliance with any privacy laws, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief.

Litigation Risk:

Litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries.

We are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. However, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. A number of civil jury verdicts involving the insurers’ sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents and other matters have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business. These lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. In some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. This discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit.

Our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects.

Actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal, tax or financial consequences.

A significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified such individuals, a risk nevertheless exists that a court, the IRS or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees. The laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations, which we cannot predict.

If there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities, employee benefits, wage payments, fines, judgments and/or legal settlements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries’ business models.

Catastrophic Event Risk:

Our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events.

Our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the United States in relatively low-face amounts. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. However, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

As of

December 31, 2018

, Torchmark had no unresolved SEC staff comments.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Torchmark, through its subsidiaries, owns or leases buildings that are used in the normal course of business. Torchmark owns and occupies a 300,000 square foot facility in McKinney, Texas. This facility is Torchmark’s corporate headquarters and also houses the operations of subsidiaries, United American and Liberty National, as well as many operations of other subsidiaries. In addition, United American leases 5,000 square feet of space in Omaha, Nebraska and, through a subsidiary, leases 3,230 square feet of office space in Syracuse, New York.

Globe Life leases 34,000 square feet of an office building located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Globe Marketing Services, a subsidiary of Globe Life, owns a 133,000 square foot facility in Oklahoma City that houses the Globe Life Direct Response operation. Globe Life also leases a 10,000 square foot storage facility in Allen, Texas.

American Income owns and occupies two buildings located in Waco, Texas: a 70,000 square foot building for corporate operations and a 43,000 square foot printing facility. American Income also leases 19,597 square feet in additional corporate office space in Waco, and leases office space throughout the United States to support its marketing operations.

Family Heritage owns 50% of a partnership that owns a 66,000 square foot building in Broadview Heights, Ohio (a suburb of Cleveland). Family Heritage leases 24,157 square feet of the building for various corporate operations. The partnership also leases a portion of the building to unrelated tenants.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including putative class action litigation, claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark’s financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit.

In 2017, tax legislation revised the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.

See Note 5—Income Taxes

for further discussion. In


, income tax expense was calculated based on the 21% rate as compared with a 35% rate for


.

In addition, the Company recorded an adjustment of $874 million to net income during 2017. In 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the tax legislation and recorded an additional $798 thousand adjustment related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the 21% rate.  As the impact of the tax legislation was treated as a non-operating event, it was excluded from net operating income.

(2)

Net operating income is considered a non-GAAP measure and it has been used consistently by Torchmark’s management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Net operating income as an ROE, excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio, is also considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of the unrealized gains or losses, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available for sale portfolio.

Summary of Operations

Net income was

$701 million

in


, compared with

$1.5 billion

in


. This decrease was primarily due to an $874 million increase to net income in 2017, relating to new tax legislation as described above. Net income

net income per diluted common share includes the effect of the adjustment to net income relating to new tax legislation. The percentage growth in net income per share results continues to exceed the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program. Each year’s net income per share was affected by realized gains (losses), which were

Net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


as such is considered a non-GAAP measure. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

We do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, net income was affected by certain significant and unusual non-operating items in each of the years


through


. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. We remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such items from our segment analysis for current periods.

SHARE PURCHASES

Torchmark has an ongoing share repurchase program that began in 1986, and is reviewed quarterly by management and annually reaffirmed by the Board of Directors. The program was reaffirmed on August 7, 2018. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flow at the Parent Company, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these purchases are made from excess cash flow. Excess cash flow at the Parent Company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt, dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders, and other limited operating activities. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. The Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years.

Analysis of Share Purchases

(Amounts in thousands)

With the significant pullback of the overall stock market in December, the Company accelerated approximately $25 million of repurchases from 2019 to 2018 at an average price of approximately $76.00. The repurchases were paid from cash at the Parent Company and issuance of commercial paper.

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow at the Parent Company.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


A discussion of each of Torchmark’s segments follows. The following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in

Note 14—Business Segments

.

LIFE INSURANCE

Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with


life premium representing

70%

of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented

73%

of the total in


. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: “annualized premium in force,” “net sales,” and “first-year collected premium.”

•

Annualized premium in force

is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue.

•

Net sales

is annualized premium issued (gross premium that would be received during the policies' first year in force and assuming that none of the policies lapsed or terminated), net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Globe Life Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a better indicator of the rate of premium growth as compared with annualized premium issued.

•

First-year collected premium

is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.

The following table presents the summary of results of life insurance.

Further discussion of the results by distribution channel is included below.

While

American Income Exclusive Agency

has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions, this agency has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups, third party internet vendor leads, and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth. This agency is Torchmark’s largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at

45%

of Torchmark’s


total. This agency produced premium income of

rose slightly

to

6,971

in


, compared with

6,962

in


. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period.

The American Income Exclusive Agency continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force. In addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities, the agency has made considerable investments in information technology, including launching a lead mapping and customer relationship management tool for the agency force. We anticipate this tool will help enhance agent productivity and agent retention.

The

Globe Life Direct Response

unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches, which include direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. These different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer. The Globe Life Direct Response channel’s long-term growth has been fueled by constant innovation. In recent years, electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology, and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center. We continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates.

While the juvenile market is an important source of sales, it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a Globe Life Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time.

Globe Life Direct Response’s life premium income

rose

2%

to

$829 million

34%

of Torchmark’s total life premium during

$270 million

. Net sales

increased

5%

during

increased

10%

to

$36 million

during


and

increased

14%

in


to

$33 million

The Liberty average producing agent count increased from

2,017

in


to

2,156

in


. We continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from small-town markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. Expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated, less-penetrated areas will help create long term agency growth. Additionally, the agency's prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new work site marketing business.

The

Other Agencies

distribution channels offering life insurance include the Military Agency, the UA Independent Agency (which predominantly writes health insurance), and various smaller distribution channels. The Other Agencies contributed

$217 million

of life premium income, or

9%

of Torchmark’s total in


, but contributed only

3%

of net sales for the year.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


HEALTH INSURANCE

Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement insurance, critical illness coverage, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products. In this analysis, all health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement are classified as limited-benefit plans.

Health premium accounted for

30%

of our total premium in


, while the health underwriting margin accounted for

26%

of total underwriting margin, reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance. As noted under the caption

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Operating expenses are included in the Corporate and Other segment and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the Parent Company. Insurance administrative expenses generally include those expenses incurred after a policy has been issued. Expenses associated with the issuance of our insurance policies are reflected as acquisition expenses and included in the determination of underwriting margin. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended

December 31, 2018

.

Operating Expenses Selected Information

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

The

6.3%

increase

in insurance administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in other employee costs and information technology salaries and expenses. Other employee costs increased primarily due to higher pension expense driven by lower interest rates.

T

he increase in information technology costs reflects investments related to data analytics capabilities, administrative systems modernizations, and information security programs. The

increase

in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to higher expense associated with equity awards, reflecting Torchmark's higher share price as compared with the same period a year ago.

INVESTMENTS

We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in

Note 14—Business Segments

.

It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest on net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs.”

We also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used

$7.5 billion

of excess cash flow at the Parent Company to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater risk adjusted after-tax return than other investment alternatives. If we had not used this excess cash to repurchase shares, but had instead invested it in interest-bearing assets, we would have earned more investment income and had more shares outstanding. As

excess investment income per diluted common share incorporates all capital resources, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is a useful measure to evaluate the investment segment.

In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

Excess Investment Income

Net investment income

increased at a compound annual growth rate of

4%

during the last three years. Growth in net investment income has been negatively impacted in recent years by the declining interest rate environment during which time we have invested new money and reinvested the proceeds from bonds that matured or were called or otherwise disposed of at yield rates less than what we earned on these bonds before their maturity or disposition. We currently expect that the average annual turnover rate of fixed maturity assets during the next five years will not exceed 1% to 3% of the portfolio, and will not have a significant negative impact on the growth of net investment income. The following chart presents the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


Should interest rates, especially long-term rates, rise, Torchmark's net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases. While such a rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio, we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 30 to 35 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of

December 31, 2018

would be eliminated. Should interest rates increase further than that, we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and, more importantly, the ability, to hold our fixed maturities to maturity.

Required interest on net insurance policy liabilities

reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” the required interest included in the insurance segments. As such, it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments. As discussed in

Note 14-Business Segments

,

management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. Required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force.

The great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. That rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed. The discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. As such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted-average discount rate due to the size of our in force business.

Since actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business, benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs. Due to the strength of our underwriting margins, we do not expect an extended low-interest-rate environment to cause a loss recognition event.

Realized Gains and Losses.

Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. Since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.

Despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time, investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses generally occur only incidentally, usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

Note 11—Debt

for further discussion on loss on redemption of debt.

Investment Acquisitions

.

Torchmark’s investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low. If longer-term securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available, we do not relax our quality objectives; instead, we consider investing in shorter-term or lower yielding securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors.

During calendar years


through


, Torchmark invested predominately in fixed maturity securities, primarily in corporate bonds with longer-term maturities. The following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years. The effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield, commonly referred to as the “worst call date.” For non-callable bonds, the worst-call date is always the maturity date. For callable bonds, the worst-call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield

(or the maturity date, if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date).

Tax-equivalent basis, where the yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities.

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. Absent sales and "make-whole calls", however, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.

We are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending, we have no off-balance sheet investments, and we do not have any exposure to European sovereign debt at

December 31, 2018

. In the prior year, it was announced by the head of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority that they plan to phase out the floating rate, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), by the end of 2021. Uncertainty remains as to what will be the replacement floating rate. As of

December 31, 2018

, Torchmark had limited assets and liabilities that utilize LIBOR as a benchmark rate. We will continue to monitor the progress towards the establishment of a new floating rate.

An analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio by a composite quality rating at

December 31, 2018

is shown in the following table. The composite rating for each security, other than private-placement securities managed by third parties, is the average of the security’s ratings as assigned by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average. The composite quality rating is created using a methodology developed by Torchmark Corporation using ratings from the various rating agencies noted above. The composite quality rating is not a Standard & Poor's credit rating. Standard & Poor's does not sponsor, endorse or promote the composite quality rating and shall not be liable for any use of the composite quality rating. Included in the chart below are private placement fixed maturity holdings of

Below-Investment Grade Fixed Maturities

Our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.

Market Risk Sensitivity.

Torchmark’s investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio. Since

95%

of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio rising, and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline. Under normal market conditions, we are not concerned about unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, as is permitted by GAAP, these liabilities are not recorded at fair value.

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at

December 31, 2018

. This table measures the effect of a parallel shift in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity.

Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity

.

The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. While the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income.

Parent Company Liquidity.

Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, operating expenses of the Parent Company, and Parent Company dividends to Torchmark shareholders.

For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the

Restrictions

section of

Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity

.

Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company.

Short-Term Borrowings.

An additional source of Parent Company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million, which could be extended up to $1 billion. While Torchmark can request the extension, it is not guaranteed. In May 2016, Torchmark amended the facility to extend the maturity date to May 2021. The amendment also allowed for an additional $100 million term loan as discussed under the caption

Credit Facility

in

Note 11—Debt

. The facility is further designated as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program as well as the stand-by letters of credit as discussed below. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had available

$293 million

of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, compared with

$249 million

a year earlier. There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended

December 31, 2018

.

Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for


and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of debt, an additional short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.

Consolidated Liquidity

.

Consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were

$1.3 billion

in


, compared with

$1.4 billion

in


and

$1.2 billion

in


. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies received proceeds from maturities, calls, and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of

TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of

$16.3 billion

at

December 31, 2018

. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our commercial paper and credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

As a part of its aforementioned credit facility, Torchmark had outstanding

$155 million

in stand-by letters of credit at

December 31, 2018

. On March 14, 2018, the letters of credit were amended to reduce the amount outstanding from

$177 million

as of December 31,


. These letters are issued among our subsidiaries, one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer, and have no impact on company obligations as a whole. Any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of off-shore captive reinsurers might require Torchmark to obtain third-party financing, which could cause an insignificant increase in financing costs.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities. All of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in

Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies

.

The following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of

Purchase obligations include various long-term non-cancelable purchase commitments as well as commitments to provide capital for low-income housing tax credit interests.

(4)

Pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans. They are offset by invested assets in the trusts, which are funded through periodic contributions by Torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due. Therefore, our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on Torchmark’s

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. At

December 31, 2018

, these pension obligations were

$556 million

, but there were also assets of

$393 million

in the pension entities. The schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations, except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted. Please refer to

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

for more information on pension obligations.

(5)

Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at

December 31, 2018

. These estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of

$14 billion

at

December 31, 2018

, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.

Capital Resources.

Torchmark’s capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in

$125 million

outstanding principal of the

5.875%

Junior Subordinated Debentures that were due December 15, 2052 and that were callable beginning December 15, 2017.

Subsidiary Capital:

The

National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC

) has established a risk-based factor approach for determining threshold risk-based capital levels for all insurance companies. This approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention. A Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of risk-based capital determined using the NAIC’s factors. If a company’s RBC ratio approaches two times the RBC amount, the company must file a plan with the NAIC for improving their capital levels (this level is commonly referred to as “Company Action Level” RBC). Companies typically hold a multiple of the Company Action Level RBC depending on their particular business needs and risk profile.

Our goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings. For


, Torchmark targeted a consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio of 300% to 320%. The Company believes this capital level is more than adequate and is sufficient to support its current ratings given the nature of its business and its risk profile. Due to changes in the insurance company’s capital levels as a result of the new tax legislation effective January 1, 2018, the Parent Company used approximately $150 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2018 to provide additional capital to its insurance subsidiaries. As

of

December 31, 2018

, our consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio was 326%, slightly above our targeted range.

Torchmark is targeting a consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019.

Shareholder's Equity:

$372 million

in share purchases under the repurchase program and an additional

$50 million

in share purchases to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. Shareholder's equity was increased by

$701 million

We plan to use excess cash available at the Parent Company as efficiently as possible in the future. Possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to, share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in securities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our companies. If market conditions are favorable, we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policy liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While a majority of invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity.

Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders’ equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. From time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity. Due to the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.

The following table presents selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the table presents the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmark’s capital structure. Excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on the fixed maturity portfolio from shareholders' equity is considered non-GAAP. Below we include the reconciliation to GAAP.

Financial Strength Ratings.

The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by Standard & Poor’s and A. M. Best. The following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at

December 31, 2018

.

A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) to those insurers which have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments which differs from the highest-rated insurers only to a small degree. An insurer rated A has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers in higher-rated categories. The plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.

OTHER ITEMS

Litigation.

Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since Torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Future Policy Benefits.

Due to the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

.

Approximately

88%

of our liabilities for future policy benefits at

December 31, 2018

were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

under the caption

Future Policy Benefits.

Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies.

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the consolidated financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.

Deferred Acquisition Costs.

Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs such as advertising related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

under the caption

Deferred Acquisition Costs

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additionally, the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies, known as the value of insurance acquired (VOBA), is included in deferred acquisition costs. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

.

Over 99% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at

December 31, 2018

were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are “locked-in” at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended

December 31, 2018

.

Less than 1% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended

December 31, 2018

.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable.

This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.

Valuation of Fixed Maturities.

We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


manage risk. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption

Market Risk

Sensitivity

in this report. However, as discussed under the caption

Financial Condition

in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.

At times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. Illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly to unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

and in

Note 4—Investments

under the captions

Fair Value Measurements

in both notes.

Impairment of Investments.

We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

and the discussions under the captions

Investments

and

Realized Gains and

Losses

in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.

Defined benefit pension plans.

We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At

December 31, 2018

, our gross liability under these plans was

$556 million

, but was offset by assets of

$393 million

.

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans. For example, a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year


and projected benefit obligation as of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Torchmark Corporation (McKinney, Texas)

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries (“Torchmark”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Torchmark as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated

February 28, 2019

, expressed an unqualified opinion on Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Torchmark’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Torchmark’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Torchmark in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

Business

:

Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark or alternatively, the Company) through its wholly-owned subsidiaries provides a variety of life and supplemental health insurance products and annuities to a broad base of customers. Torchmark is organized into

four

reportable segments: life insurance, health insurance, annuity, and investment.

Basis of Presentation

:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), under guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

:

The consolidated financial statements include the results of Torchmark and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. When Torchmark acquires a subsidiary or a block of business, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets is recorded as goodwill. Expenses incurred to effect the acquisition are charged to earnings as of the acquisition date. Upon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date.

Torchmark accounts for its variable interest entities (VIEs) under accounting guidance which clarifies the definition of a variable interest and the instructions for consolidating VIEs. Only primary beneficiaries are required or allowed to consolidate VIEs. Therefore, a company may have voting control of a VIE, but if it is not the primary beneficiary, it is not permitted to consolidate the VIE. As further described under the caption

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests

below in this note, Torchmark holds passive interests in limited partnerships which provide investment returns through the provision of tax benefits (principally from the transfer of federal or state tax credits related to federal low-income housing). These interests are considered to be VIEs. They are not consolidated because the Company has no power to control the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of these entities and therefore the Company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these interests. Torchmark’s involvement is limited to its limited partnership interest in the entities. Torchmark has not provided any other financial support to the entities beyond its commitments to fund its limited partnership interests, and there are no arrangements or agreements with any of the interests to provide other financial support. The maximum loss exposure relative to these interests is limited to their carrying value.

Discontinued Operations

:

When a component of Torchmark’s business is sold or expected to be sold during the ensuing year, Torchmark considers whether the criteria of  ASC 205-20,

Discontinued Operations

, have been met, which includes evaluating if the disposal of a component represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company. If the disposal meets the criteria for discontinued operations, the assets and liabilities are segregated and recorded in the

Consolidated Balance Sheets

as "Assets and Liabilities related to discontinued operations" for all periods presented. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized. The results of operations for the discontinued component are reported in "Income from discontinued operations, net of tax" in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

for current and prior periods. Discontinued operations are reported commencing in the period in which the business is either disposed of or meets the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, including any gain or loss recognized on the sale or adjustment of the carrying amount to the estimated fair value less cost to sell.

Torchmark sold one of its operating segments, Medicare Part D, during 2016. The financial results of this business are excluded from Torchmark's continuing operations including the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Investments

:

Torchmark classifies all of its fixed maturity investments as available for sale. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Other long-term investments include equity securities, real estate, commercial mortgage loan participations, and limited partnerships.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


TORCHMARK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in

"

Realized Gains (Losses)" in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

. Investments in real estate are reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method. Investments in certain limited partnerships are accounted for using the fair value option

and fluctuations in fair value are reported in "

Realized Gains (Losses)

."

Short-term investments include investments in interest-bearing assets with original maturities of twelve months or less. Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on a specific identification basis.

Commercial mortgage loan participations, a type of investment where the mortgage loan is shared among investors, are accounted for as financing receivables. The commercial mortgage loan participations are managed by a third party. The Company purchased the legal rights to interests in commercial mortgage loans which are secured by properties such as hotels, retail, multiple family, or offices. The commercial mortgage loans typically have a term of three years with the option to extend up to two years. The commercial mortgages loans are recorded at unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized origination fees and net of allowance for loan losses, if applicable. Interest income, net of the amortization of origination fees, is recorded in "Net Investment Income" under the effective yield method. The Company evaluates the performance and credit quality of each individual commercial mortgage on a quarterly basis, or as needed, by utilizing common metrics such as loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as evaluating the fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of the underlying collateral is based on a third party appraisal of the property. The Company will also determine the probability of estimated losses for each commercial mortgage loan and record an allowance if conclusions are reached that collection of principal and interest are not probable. The allowance for loan losses are based on estimates, historical experience, probability of loss, value of the underlying collateral, and macro factors that affect the collectability of the loan. All assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary.

Fair Value Measurements, Investments in Securities

:

Torchmark measures the fair value of its fixed maturities based on a hierarchy consisting of three levels which indicate the quality of the fair value measurements as described below:

•

Level 1—

fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date.

•

Level 2—

fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that can otherwise be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3—

fair values are based on inputs that are considered unobservable where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability as of the measurement date. In this circumstance, the Company has to rely on values derived by independent brokers or internally-developed assumptions. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available to the Company which may include the Company’s own data or bid and ask prices in the dealer market.

The great majority of Torchmark's fixed maturities are not actively traded and direct quotes are not generally available. Management therefore determines the fair values of these securities after consideration of data provided by third-party pricing services, independent broker/dealers, and other resources. At

December 31, 2018

, Torchmark's investments in fixed maturities were primarily composed of the following significant security types: corporate securities, state and municipal securities, and U.S. government securities. The remaining security types represented less than

2%

of the total in the aggregate.

Over

95%

of the fair value reported at

December 31, 2018

was determined using data provided by third-party pricing services. Prices provided by these services are not binding offers, but are estimated exit values. Third-party pricing services use proprietary pricing models to determine security values by discounting cash flows using a market-adjusted spread to a benchmark yield.


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


TORCHMARK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

For all asset classes within Torchmark’s significant security types, third-party pricing services use a common valuation technique to model the price of the investments using observable market data. The foundation for these models consists of developing yield spreads based on multiple observable market inputs, including but not limited to: benchmark yield curves, actual trading activity, new issue yields, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, sector-specific data, economic data, and other inputs that are corroborated in the market. Pricing vendors monitor and review their pricing data continuously with current market and economic data feeds, augmented by ongoing communication within the dealer community.

Using the observable market inputs described above, spreads to an appropriate benchmark yield are further developed by the vendors for each security based on security-specific and/or sector-specific risk factors, such as a security’s terms and conditions (coupon, maturity, and call features), credit rating, sector, liquidity, collateral or other cash flow options, and other factors that could impact the risk of the security. Embedded repayment options, such as call and redemption features, are also taken into account in the pricing models. When the spread is determined, it is added to the security’s benchmark yield. The security's expected cash flows are discounted using this spread-adjusted yield, and the resulting present value of the discounted cash flows is the evaluated price.

When third-party vendor prices are not available, the Company attempts to obtain valuations from other sources, including but not limited to broker/dealers, broker quotes, and prices on comparable securities.

When valuations have been obtained for all securities in the portfolio, management reviews and analyzes the prices to ensure their reasonableness, taking into account available observable information. When two or more valuations are available for a security and the variance between the prices is 10% or less, the close correlation suggests similar observable inputs were used in deriving the price, and the mean of the prices is used. Securities valued in this manner are classified as Level 2. When the variance between two or more valuations for a security exceeds 10%, additional analysis is performed to determine the most appropriate value for that security, using resources such as broker quotes, prices on comparable securities, recent trades, and any other observable market data. Further review is performed on the available valuations to determine if they can be corroborated within reasonable tolerance to any other observable evidence. If one of the valuations or the mean of the available valuations for a security can be corroborated with other observable evidence, then the corroborated value is used and reported as Level 2. The Company uses information and analytical techniques deemed appropriate for determining the point within the range of reasonable fair value estimates that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions. Valuations that cannot be corroborated within a reasonable tolerance are classified as Level 3.

Torchmark invests in a portfolio of private placement fixed maturities that are not actively traded. This portfolio is managed by third parties. The portfolio managers provide valuations for the bonds based on a pricing matrix utilizing observable inputs, such as the benchmark treasury rate and published sector indices, and unobservable inputs such as an internally-developed credit rating. If they cannot be corroborated, the fair values are classified as Level 3.

The fair values for each class of security and by valuation hierarchy level are indicated in

Note 4—Investments

under the caption

Fair value measurements

and

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

under the caption

Pension Plans

.

Fair Value Measurements, Other Financial Instruments

:

Fair values for cash, short-term investments, short-term debt, commercial mortgage loan participations, limited partnerships, receivables, and payables approximate carrying value. Fair values of mortgage loans are determined based upon expected cash flows discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The fair value of investments in limited partnerships that provide low-income housing tax credits is based on discounted projected cash flows. The commercial mortgage loan participations and the limited partnerships are classified as level 3. Policy loans are an integral part of Torchmark’s subsidiaries’ life insurance policies in force and their fair values cannot be valued separately and apart from the insurance contracts.

The fair values of Torchmark’s long-term debt issues are based on the same methodology as investments in fixed maturities. At

December 31, 2018

, observable inputs were available for these debt securities and as such were classified

as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. The fair value for each debt instrument as of

December 31, 2018

is disclosed in

Note 11—Debt

.

As described in

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

, Torchmark maintains a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan. Therefore the assets, that support the liability for this plan, are considered general assets of the Company. These assets consist of the cash value of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLI) and exchange traded funds (ETFs). The fair value of the insurance cash values approximates carrying value. Fair values for the ETFs are derived from direct quotes and are considered Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy.

Impairment of Investments

:

Torchmark’s portfolio of fixed maturities fluctuates in value due to changes in interest rates in the financial markets as well as other factors. Fluctuations caused by market interest rate changes have little bearing on whether or not the investment will be ultimately recoverable. Therefore, Torchmark considers these declines in value resulting from changes in market interest rates to be temporary. In certain circumstances, however, Torchmark determines that the decline in the value of a security is other-than-temporary and writes the book value of the security down to its fair value, realizing an investment loss. The evaluation of Torchmark’s securities for other-than-temporary impairments is a process that is undertaken at least quarterly and is overseen by a team of investment and accounting professionals. Each security, which is impaired because the fair value is less than the cost or amortized cost, is identified and evaluated. The determination that an impairment is other-than-temporary is highly subjective and involves the careful consideration of many factors. Among the factors considered are:

•

The length of time and extent to which the security has been impaired

•

The reason(s) for the impairment

•

The financial condition of the issuer and the prospects for recovery in fair value of the security

•

The Company’s ability and intent to hold the security until anticipated recovery

•

Expected future cash flows

The relative weight given to each of these factors can change over time as facts and circumstances change. In many cases, management believes it is appropriate to give relatively more weight to prospective factors than to retrospective factors. Prospective factors that are given more weight include prospects for recovery, the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security until anticipated recovery, and expected future cash flows.

Among the facts and information considered in the process are:

•

Financial statements of the issuer

•

Changes in credit ratings of the issuer

•

The value of underlying collateral

•

News and information included in press releases issued by the issuer

•

News and information reported in the media concerning the issuer

•

News and information published by or otherwise provided by securities, economic, or research analysts

•

The nature and amount of recent and expected future sources and uses of cash

•

Default on a required payment

•

Issuer bankruptcy filings

While all available information is taken into account, it is difficult to predict the ultimate recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security. If a security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the cost basis of the


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


TORCHMARK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

security is written down to fair value and is treated as a realized loss in the period the determination is made. The written-down security will be amortized and revenue recognized in accordance with estimated future cash flows.

Current accounting guidance is such that if an entity intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired security prior to recovery of its cost basis, the security is to be considered other-than-temporarily impaired and the full amount of impairment must be charged to earnings. Otherwise, losses on fixed maturities which are other-than-temporarily impaired are separated into two categories, the portion of loss which is considered credit loss and the portion of loss which is due to other factors. The credit loss portion is charged to earnings while the loss due to other factors is charged to other comprehensive income. The credit loss portion of an impairment is determined as the difference between the security’s amortized cost and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the security’s original effective yield rate. The temporary portion is the difference between this present value of expected future cash flows and fair value (as discounted by a market yield). The expected cash flows are determined using judgment and the best information available to the Company. Inputs used to derive expected cash flows include expected default rates, current levels of subordination, and loan-to-collateral value ratios.

Cash

:

Cash consists of balances on hand and on deposit in banks and financial institutions.

Accrued investment income

:

Accrued investment income consists of interest income or dividends earned on the investment portfolio, but are yet to be received as of the balance sheet date. The Company will write-off accrued investment income that is deemed to be uncollectible.

Other Receivables

:

Other receivables consist mostly of agent debit balances that primarily represent commissions advanced to insurance agents. These balances are repaid to the Company over time as the premiums associated with the advanced commissions are collected by the Company and the agents' commissions on such premiums are retained. The balances were

$396 million

and

$378 million

at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively. Management believes these balances are recoverable as they are less than the estimated present value of future commissions.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

: Certain costs of acquiring new insurance business are deferred and recorded as an asset. These costs are essential for the acquisition of new insurance business and are directly related to the successful issuance of an insurance contract including sales commissions, policy issue costs, and underwriting costs. Additionally, deferred acquisition costs (DAC) include the value of business acquired (VOBA), which are the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies. These costs represent the difference between the fair value of the contractual insurance assets acquired and liabilities assumed compared against the assets and liabilities for insurance contracts that the Company issues or holds measured in accordance with GAAP.

DAC and VOBA are amortized in a systematic manner which matches these costs with the associated revenues. Policies other than universal life-type policies are amortized with interest over the estimated premium-paying period of the policies in a manner which charges each year’s operations in proportion to the receipt of premium income. Universal life-type policies are amortized with interest in proportion to estimated gross profits. The assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs include interest, mortality, morbidity, and persistency, and are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits. For interest-sensitive and deposit-balance type products, these assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations. For all other products, amortization assumptions are generally not revised once established.

DAC and VOBA are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing to determine if there is a premium deficiency. These tests evaluate whether the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DAC and VOBA assets. These cash flows consist primarily of premium income, less benefits and expenses taking inflation into account. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is then compared with the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance. In the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less, the deficiency would be recognized by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future benefits, as described under the caption

Future Policy Benefits

Advertising Costs

: Costs related to advertising are generally charged to expense as incurred. However, certain Globe Life Direct Response advertising costs are capitalized when there is a reliable and demonstrated relationship between total costs and future benefits that is a direct result of incurring these costs. Globe Life Direct Response advertising costs consist primarily of the production and distribution costs of direct mail advertising materials, and when capitalized are included as a component of DAC. They are amortized in the same manner as other DAC. Globe Life Direct Response advertising costs charged to earnings and included in other operating expense were

Goodwill

:

The excess cost of a business acquired over the fair value of net assets acquired is reported as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to impairment testing in accordance with GAAP on an annual basis, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur. The Company may perform a qualitative analysis under certain circumstances, or perform a two-step quantitative analysis. In the qualitative analysis, the Company determines if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount by assessing current events and circumstances. If there are factors present indicating potential impairment, the Company would proceed to the two-step quantitative analysis.

In the two-step quantitative analysis, the Company utilizes two approaches, income and market, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. In the income approach, judgment and assumptions are used in developing the projected cash flows for the reporting units, and such estimates are subject to change. The Company also exercises judgment in the determination of the discount rate as management believes this to be appropriate for the risk associated with the cash flow expectations. In the market approach, the Company utilizes the share price and a control premium based on businesses with similar assets to determine a fair value. In both cases, the fair value of each reporting unit is then measured against that reporting unit’s corresponding carrying value. In the event the fair value is less than the carrying value, further testing is required under the accounting guidance to determine the amount of impairment, if any. If there is an impairment in the goodwill of any reporting unit, it is written down and charged to earnings in the period of the test.

Torchmark tested its goodwill annually as of June 30th in each of the years

. Torchmark’s goodwill was not impaired in any of those periods.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests

:

Torchmark invests in limited partnerships that provide low-income housing tax credits and other related federal income tax benefits to Torchmark. The carrying value of Torchmark’s investment in these entities was

$226 million

and

$228 million

at

December 31, 2018

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of

December 31, 2018

, Torchmark was obligated under future commitments of

$51 million

, which are recorded in "Other liabilities". For guaranteed investments acquired prior to January 1, 2015, the Company utilizes the effective-yield method of amortization, while the proportional method of amortization is utilized for all non-guaranteed and guaranteed investments acquired on or after January 1, 2015. All amortization expense is recorded in "Income tax benefit (expense)" on the

Property and Equipment

:

Property and equipment, included in “Other assets,” is reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is recorded primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets which range from

three

to

five

years for equipment and

ten

to

forty

years for buildings and improvements. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Impairments, if any, are recorded when certain events and circumstances become evident that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Original cost of property and equipment was

$256 million

at

December 31, 2018

Future Policy Benefits

:

The liability for future policy benefits for annuity and universal life-type products is represented by policy account value. The liability for future policy benefits for all other life and health products, approximately

88%


TMK 2018 FORM 10-K


TORCHMARK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

of total liabilities for future policy benefits, is determined on the net level premium method. This method provides for the present value of expected future benefit payments less the present value of expected future net premiums, based on estimated investment yields, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and other assumptions which were considered appropriate at the time the policies were issued. For limited-payment contracts, a deferred profit liability is also recorded which causes profits to emerge over the life of the contract in proportion to policies in force.

Assumptions used for traditional life and health insurance products are based primarily on Company experience. Assumptions for interest rates range from

2.5%

to

7.0%

for Torchmark’s insurance companies with an overall weighted average assumed rate of

5.7%

. Mortality tables used for individual life insurance include various statutory tables and modifications of a variety of generally accepted actuarial tables. Morbidity assumptions for individual health are based on Company experience and industry data. Withdrawal and termination assumptions are based on Torchmark’s experience. Once established, assumptions for these products are generally not changed. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions. These estimates are reviewed annually and compared with actual experience. If it is determined that existing contract liabilities, together with the present value of future gross premiums, will not be sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits and to recover unamortized deferred acquisition costs, then a premium deficiency exists. Such a deficiency would be recognized immediately by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized deferred acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future policy benefits. From that point forward, the liability for future policy benefits would be based on revised assumptions.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable

:

Torchmark establishes a liability for known policy benefits payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Torchmark makes an estimate of unreported claims after careful evaluation of all information available to the Company. This estimate is based on prior experience and is reviewed quarterly. However, there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, will be Torchmark’s ultimate obligation.

See Note 7—Liability for Unpaid Claims

for disclosures.

Income Taxes

:

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement book values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) was enacted into law which changed existing tax law, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, the Company recorded

$874 million

in net income, primarily as a result of remeasuring its deferred assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate as of the date of enactment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the tax legislation and recorded an additional

$798 thousand

adjustment related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the 21% rate. More information concerning income taxes is provided in

Note 8—Income Taxes

Postretirement Benefits

:

Torchmark accounts for its postretirement defined benefit plans by recognizing the funded status of those plans on its

Consolidated Balance Sheets

in accordance with accounting guidance. Periodic gains and losses attributable to changes in plan assets and liabilities that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are recognized as components of other comprehensive income, net of tax. More information concerning the accounting and disclosures for postretirement benefits is found in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Recognition of Premium Revenue and Related Expenses

:

Premium income for traditional long-duration life and health insurance products is recognized evenly over the contract period and when due from the policyholder. Premiums for short-duration health contracts are recognized as revenue over the contract period in proportion to the insurance protection provided. Premiums for universal life-type and annuity contracts are added to the policy account value, and revenues for such products are recognized as charges to the policy account value for mortality, administration, and surrenders (retrospective deposit method). Life premium includes policy charges of

$16 million

,

$17 million

, and

$18 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, respectively. Other premium consists of annuity policy charges in each year. For most insurance products, the related benefits and expenses are matched with revenues by means of the provision of future policy benefits and the amortization of DAC in a manner which recognizes profits as they are earned over the revenue recognition period. For limited-payment life insurance products, the profits are recognized over the contract period.

Stock-Based Compensation

:

Torchmark accounts for stock-based compensation by recognizing an expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the “fair value method.” The fair value method requires that a fair value be assigned to a stock option or other stock grant on its grant date and that this value be amortized over the grantees’ service period.

The fair value method requires the use of an option valuation model to value employee stock options. Torchmark has elected to use the Black-Scholes valuation model for option expensing. A summary of assumptions for options granted in each of the three years


through


is as follows:

The expected term is generally derived from Company experience. However, expected terms are determined based on the simplified method as permitted under the ASC 718

Stock Compensation

topic when Company experience is insufficient. The Torchmark Corporation 2011 Incentive Plan replaced all previous plans and allows for option grants for employees with a

ten

-year contractual term which vest over

five

years in addition to

seven

-year grants which vest over

three

years as permitted by the previous plans. Director grants vest over

six

months. The Company has sufficient experience with

seven

-year grants that vest in

three

years, but insufficient historical experience with

five

-year vesting. Therefore, Torchmark has used the simplified method to determine the expected term for the

ten

-year grants with

five

-year vesting and will do so until adequate experience is developed. Volatility and risk-free interest rates are assumed over a period of time consistent with the expected term of the option. Volatility is measured on a historical basis. Monthly data points are utilized to derive volatility for periods greater than

three

years. Expected dividend yield is based on current dividend yield held constant over the expected term. Once the fair value of an option has been determined, it is amortized on a straight-line basis over the employee’s service period for that grant (from the grant date to the date the grant is fully vested). Expenses for restricted stock and restricted stock units are based on the grant date fair value allocated on a straight-line basis over the service period. Performance share expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the probability of meeting the metrics identified in the performance share award agreement, assigned to each service period as these estimates develop. On April 26, 2018, the shareholders approved of the Torchmark Corporation 2018 Incentive Plan. No awards related to this plan were issued as of December 31, 2018. The 2018 Incentive Plan replaced all previous plans.

Torchmark management views all stock-based compensation expense as a corporate or Parent Company expense and, therefore, presents it as such in its segment analysis (See

Note 14—Business Segments

). It is included in “Other operating expense” in the

Note 2—Statutory Accounting

Life insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are required to file statutory financial statements with state insurance regulatory authorities. Accounting principles used to prepare these statutory financial statements differ from GAAP. Consolidated net income and shareholders’ equity (capital and surplus) on a statutory basis for the insurance subsidiaries were as follows:

The excess, if any, of shareholder’s equity of the insurance subsidiaries on a GAAP basis over that determined on a statutory basis is not available for distribution by the insurance subsidiaries to Torchmark without regulatory approval. Insurance subsidiaries’ statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements in the aggregate was

$499 million

at

December 31, 2018

. More information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends can be found in

Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity

.

Torchmark’s statutory financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting practices prescribed by the insurance department of the state of domicile of each insurance subsidiary. While all states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) statutory accounting practices (NAIC SAP) as the basis for statutory accounting, certain states have retained prescribed practices of their respective insurance code or administrative code which can differ from NAIC SAP. For Torchmark’s life insurance companies, there are no significant differences between NAIC SAP and the accounting practices prescribed by the states of domicile.

Quantitative Information about Level 3

Fair Value Measurements

As of

December 31, 2018

The private placement fixed maturities and asset-backed securities reported as Level 3 are managed by third party investment managers. These securities are valued based on the contractual cash flows discounted by a yield determined as a treasury benchmark adjusted for a credit spread. The credit spread is developed from observable indices for similar public fixed maturities and unobservable indices for private fixed maturities for corresponding credit ratings. However, the credit ratings for the securities are considered unobservable inputs, as they are assigned by the third party investment manager based on a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit underwritten. A higher (lower) credit rating would result in a higher (lower) valuation.

The collateral underlying collateralized debt obligations for which fair values are reported as Level 3 consists primarily of trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. Collateralized debt obligations are valued at the present value of expected future cash flows using an unobservable discount rate. Expected cash flows are determined by scheduling the projected repayment of the collateral assuming no future defaults, deferrals, or recoveries. The discount rate is risk-adjusted to take these items into account. A significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate will produce a significant decrease (increase) in fair value. Additionally, a significant increase (decrease) in the cash flow expectations would result in a significant increase (decrease) in fair value. For more information regarding valuation procedures, please refer to

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

under the caption

Fair Value Measurements, Investments in Securities

.

The following table presents transfers in and out of each of the valuation levels of fair values.

Transfers into Level 2 from Level 3 result from the availability of observable market data when a security is valued at the end of a period. Transfers into Level 3 occur when there is a lack of observable market information. Transfers into Level 1 from Level 2 occur when direct quotes are available; transfers from Level 1 into Level 2 result when only observable market data and no direct quotes are available. Transfers between levels are recognized as of the end of the period of transfer.

Unclaimed Property Audits

:

Torchmark subsidiaries are currently the subject of audits regarding the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed property arising from life insurance policies and a limited number of annuity contracts. These audits are being conducted by private entities that have contracted with

forty-seven

states through their respective Departments of Revenue, and have not resulted in any financial assessment from any state nor indicated any liability. The audits are wide-ranging and seek large amounts of data regarding claims handling, procedures, and payments of contract benefits arising from unreported death claims. No estimate of range can be made at this time for loss contingencies related to possible administrative penalties or amounts that could be payable to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property.

Litigation

:

Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including

putative class action litigation

, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark’s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that

it is reasonably possible that

such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark’s financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts. Torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit.

On September 12, 2018, putative class action litigation was filed against American Income Life Insurance Company in California’s Contra Costa County Superior Court (

Joh v. American Income Life Insurance Company

, Case No. C18-01863). An amended complaint was filed on October 18, 2018. American Income removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Case No. 3:18-cv-06364-TSH). The plaintiff, a former insurance sales agent of American Income, is suing on behalf of all current and former sales agents who sold insurance for American Income in the state of California for the four years prior to the filing of the complaint. The amended complaint alleges that such individuals are employees and asserts claims under the California Labor Code, California Business and Professions Code, and California Private Attorney General Act. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, penalties and attorney fees on claims for failure to pay wages/commissions, failure to appropriately pay agents at termination, failure to provide itemized wage statements, failure to reimburse expenses and unfair business practices. The Company continues to assess the amount and thus does not have a reasonable estimate of any potential liability.

On October 18, 2018, putative class action litigation was filed against Torchmark Corporation and American Income Life Insurance Company in California’s Los Angeles County Superior Court (

An amended complaint was filed on February 5, 2019. The amended complaint alleges that the putative class members are employees and asserts claims under the California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code. The complaint alleges that plaintiff was an American Income insurance agent trainee in California who seeks to represent a class of individuals in California whom American Income classified as independently contracted agent trainees.

failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, failure to appropriately pay wages at termination, failure to provide itemized wage statements, failure to reimburse business expenses, and unfair business practices.

On December 14, 2018, putative class action litigation was filed against American Income Life Insurance Company in United States District Court for the Northern District of California (

Hamilton v. American Income Life Insurance Company

The plaintiffs, former insurance sales agents of American Income, are suing on behalf of all current and former sales agents who sold insurance for American Income in the state of California for the last four years prior to the filing of the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that putative class members are employees and asserts claims under the California Labor Code, California Business and Professions Code, and California Private Attorney General Act. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, penalties and attorney fees on claims for failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, failure to appropriately pay agents at termination, failure to provide itemized wage statements, failure to reimburse expenses, and unfair business practices. The Company continues to assess the amount and thus does not have a reasonable estimate of any potential liability.

On January 16, 2019, putative class action litigation was filed against American Income Life Insurance Company in Orange County, California Superior Court (

Putros v. American Income Life Insurance Company

, Case No. 30-2019-01044772-CU-OE-CXC). The plaintiff, a former insurance sales agent of American Income, is suing on behalf of all current and former sales agents who sold insurance for American Income in the state of California for the last four years prior to the filing of the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that putative class members are employees and asserts claims under the California Labor Code, California Business and Professions Code, and California Private Attorney General Act. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, penalties and attorney fees on claims for failure to pay minimum wage, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, failure to appropriately pay agents at termination, failure to provide itemized wage statements, failure to reimburse expenses, and unfair business practices. The Company continues to assess the amount and thus does not have a reasonable estimate of any potential liability.

With respect to its current litigation, at this time management believes that the possibility of a material judgment adverse to Torchmark is remote, and no estimate of range can be made for loss contingencies that are at least reasonably possible but not accrued.

Guaranty Fund Assessment

: In 2017, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania issued orders placing Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company (Penn Treaty) and affiliate American Network Insurance Company (ANIC) in liquidation due to financial difficulties. In such instances, the various state guaranty fund associations employ funding mechanisms, through assessments to their member companies, to cover the obligations of the insolvent entities. Consequently, the Company continues to receive guaranty fund assessments from the state associations related to these companies. The Company has projected its share of the ultimate assessments from these insolvencies based on assumptions about future events and its market share of premiums by state. We anticipate a majority of the estimates will be recoverable through state premium tax credit offsets. In 2017, we recorded

$1.8 million

as the estimated amount deemed unrecoverable.

Note 7—Liability for Unpaid Claims

Activity in the liability for unpaid health claims is summarized as follows:

At the end of each period, the liability for unpaid health claims includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Such estimates are updated regularly based upon the Company’s most recent claims data with recognition of emerging experience trends. Due to the nature of the Company’s health business, the payment lags are relatively short and most claims are fully paid within a year from the time incurred. Fluctuations in claims experience can lead to either over or under estimation of the liability for any given year. The difference between the estimate made at the end of the prior period and the actual experience during the period is reflected above under the caption “Incurred related to: Prior years.”

Note 8—Income Taxes

The following table discloses significant components of income taxes for each year presented:

In each of the years


through


, deferred income tax expense (benefit) was incurred because of certain differences between net income before income tax expense (benefit) as reported on the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

and taxable income as reported on Torchmark’s income tax returns. As explained in

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

,

these differences caused the consolidated financial statement book values of some assets and liabilities to be different from their respective tax bases.

Due to the passage of tax legislation in 2017, the Company recorded an

$877 million

deferred income tax benefit as a result of remeasuring its deferred assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate as of the date of enactment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the tax legislation, as required by ASC 740

Income Taxes,

and recorded an additional

$798 thousand

adjustment related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the 21% rate.

The effective income tax rate differed from the expected U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for prior years as shown below:

Note 8—Income Taxes (continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below:

Income Tax Return

: Torchmark and all of its subsidiaries file a life-nonlife consolidated federal income tax return for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.  Family Heritage Life Insurance Company (Family Heritage) filed its federal income tax return on a separate company basis for the taxable years prior to 2018. The statutes of limitations for the Internal Revenue Service's examination and assessment of additional tax are closed for all tax years prior to 2015 with respect to Torchmark’s consolidated as well as Family Heritage's federal income tax returns. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any potential assessments that may result from current or future tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open years.

Valuations

: Torchmark has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately

$35.3 million

at

December 31, 2018

that will begin to expire in 2033 if not otherwise used to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is to be provided when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized by the Company.

No

valuation allowance has been recorded relating to Torchmark’s deferred tax assets as management believes Torchmark will more likely than not have sufficient taxable income in future periods to fully realize its existing deferred tax assets.

Torchmark’s tax liability is adjusted to include a provision for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. However, during the years


through

Note 9—Postretirement Benefits

Torchmark has qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and contributory savings plans that cover substantially all employees. There is also a nonqualified noncontributory supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) that covers a limited number of employees. The total cost of these retirement plans charged to operations was as follows:

(1)

401K plans

(2)

Qualified pension plans and SERP

Torchmark accrues expense for the defined contribution plans based on a percentage of the employees’ contributions. The plans are funded by the employee contributions and a Torchmark contribution equal to the amount of accrued expense. Plan contributions are both mandatory and discretionary, depending on the terms of the plan.

Pension Plans

:

Cost for the defined benefit pension plans has been calculated on the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. All plan measurements for the defined benefit plans are as of December 31 of the respective year. The defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of employees are qualified and funded. Contributions are made to funded pension plans subject to minimums required by regulation and maximums allowed for tax purposes. Torchmark's SERP provides to a limited number of executives an additional supplemental defined pension benefit. The supplemental benefit is based on the participant’s qualified plan benefit without consideration to the regulatory limits on compensation and benefit payments applicable to qualified plans, except that eligible compensation is capped at

$1 million

. The SERP is nonqualified and unfunded. However, a Rabbi Trust has been established to support the liability for this plan. The trust consists of life insurance policies on the lives of plan participants with an unaffiliated insurance carrier as well as an investment account.

Since this plan is nonqualified, the investments and the policyholder value of the insurance policies in the Rabbi Trust are not included as defined benefit plan assets, but rather assets of the Company. They are included in “Other Assets” in the

Consolidated Balance Sheets

A fund including marketable securities that mirror the S&P 500 index.

(2)

Representing a guaranteed annuity contract issued by Torchmark's subsidiary, American Income Life Insurance Company, to fund the obligations of the American Income Pension Plan.

Torchmark’s investment objectives for its plan assets include preservation of capital, preservation of purchasing power, and long-term growth. Torchmark seeks to preserve capital through investments made in high quality securities with adequate diversification by issuer and industry sector to minimize risk. The portfolio is monitored continuously for changes in quality and diversification mix. The preservation of purchasing power is intended to be accomplished through asset growth, exclusive of contributions and withdrawals in excess of the rate of inflation. Torchmark intends to maintain investments that when combined with future plan contributions will produce adequate long-term growth to provide for all plan obligations. It is also Torchmark’s objective that the portfolio’s investment return will meet or exceed the return of a balanced market index.

The majority of the securities in the portfolio are highly marketable so that there will be adequate liquidity to meet projected payments. There are no specific policies calling for asset durations to match those of benefit obligations.

Allowed investments are limited to equities, fixed maturities, and short-term investments (invested cash). The assets are to be invested in a mix of equity and fixed income investments that best serve the objectives of the pension plan. Factors to be considered in determining the asset mix include funded status, annual pension expense, annual pension contributions, and balance sheet liability. Equities can include common and preferred stocks, securities convertible into equities, mutual funds and exchange traded funds that invest in equities, equity interests in limited partnerships, and other equity-related investments. Primarily, equities are listed on major exchanges and adequate market liquidity is required. Fixed maturities primarily consist of marketable debt securities rated investment grade at purchase by a major rating agency. Short-term investments include fixed maturities with maturities less than one year and invested cash. Short-term investments in commercial paper must be rated at least A-2 by Standard & Poor’s with the issuer rated investment grade. Invested cash is limited to banks rated A or higher. Investments outside of the aforementioned list are not permitted, except by prior approval of the Plan’s Trustees.

The investment portfolio is to be well diversified to avoid undue exposure to a single sector, industry, business, or security. The equity and fixed maturity portfolios are not permitted to invest in any single issuer that would exceed

Torchmark's equity securities include an exchange traded fund that mirrors the S&P 500 index which better aligns with a passive approach rather than an actively managed portfolio. At

Pension Liability

The following table discloses the assumptions used to determine Torchmark’s pension liabilities and costs for the appropriate periods. The discount and compensation increase rates are used to determine current year projected benefit obligations and subsequent year pension expense. The long-term rate of return is used to determine current year expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are included in actuarial gain or loss.

Weighted Average Pension Plan Assumptions

The discount rate is determined based on the expected duration of plan liabilities. A yield is then derived based on the current market yield of a hypothetical portfolio of higher-quality corporate bonds that match the liability duration. The rate of compensation increase is projected based on Company experience, modified as appropriate for future expectations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is management’s best estimate of the average rate of earnings expected to be received on the assets invested in the plan over the benefit period. In determining this assumption, consideration is given to the historical rate of return earned on the assets, the projected returns over future periods, and the discount rate used to compute benefit obligations.

Certain employees and directors have been granted fixed equity options to buy shares of Torchmark stock at the market value of the stock on the date of grant, under the provisions of the Torchmark stock option plans. The options are exercisable during the period commencing from the date they vest until expiring according to the terms of the grant. Options generally expire the earlier of employee termination or option contract term, which are either

seven

-year or

ten

-year terms. Options generally vest in accordance with the following schedule:

All employee options vest immediately upon retirement on or after the attainment of age 65, upon death, or disability.

Note 14—Business Segments

Torchmark is organized into

four

segments: life insurance, supplemental health insurance, annuities, and investments. We also have other administrative expenses reported in "Corporate & Other."

Torchmark’s reportable segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance, supplemental health insurance, and annuities. These major product lines are set out as reportable segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management techniques. There is also an investment segment which manages the investment portfolio, debt, and cash flow for the insurance segments and the corporate function. Torchmark's chief operating decision makers evaluate the overall performance of the operations of the Company in accordance with these segments.

Life insurance products include traditional and interest-sensitive whole life insurance as well as term life insurance. Health insurance products are generally guaranteed-renewable and include Medicare Supplement, critical illness, accident, and limited-benefit supplemental hospital and surgical coverage. Annuities include fixed-benefit contracts.

Torchmark markets its insurance products through a number of distribution channels, each of which sells the products of one or more of Torchmark’s insurance segments. The tables below present segment premium revenue by each of Torchmark’s distribution channels.

TORCHMARK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

Note 14—Business Segments (continued)

Due to the nature of the life insurance industry, Torchmark has no individual or group which would be considered a major customer. Substantially all of Torchmark’s business is conducted in the United States.

The measure of profitability established by the chief operating decision makers for insurance segments is underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses, in accordance with the manner the segments are managed. It essentially represents gross profit margin on insurance products before insurance administrative expenses and consists primarily of premium less net policy benefits, acquisition expenses, and commissions. Required interest on net policy liabilities (benefit reserves less deferred acquisition costs) is reflected as a component of the Investment segment (rather than as a component of underwriting margin in the insurance and annuity segments) in order to match this cost with the investment income earned on the assets supporting the net policy liabilities.

The measure of profitability for the Investment segment is excess investment income, which represents the income earned on the investment portfolio in excess of net policy requirements and financing costs associated with Torchmark’s debt. Other than the above-mentioned interest allocations and an intersegment commission, there are no other intersegment revenues or expenses. Expenses directly attributable to corporate operations are included in the “Corporate & Other” category. Stock-based compensation expense is considered a corporate expense by Torchmark management and is included in this category. All other unallocated revenues and expenses on a pretax basis, including insurance administrative expense, are also included in the “Corporate & Other” segment category.

Torchmark holds a sizable investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities, the yield from which is used to offset policy benefit, acquisition, administrative and tax expenses. This yield or investment income is taken into account when establishing premium rates and profitability expectations of its insurance products. In holding such a portfolio, investments are sold, called, or written down from time to time, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains or losses generally occur as a result of disposition due to issuer calls, compliance with Company investment policies, or other reasons often beyond management’s control. Unlike investment income, realized gains and losses are incidental to insurance operations, and only overall yields are considered when setting premium rates or insurance product profitability expectations. While these gains and losses are not relevant to segment profitability or core operating results, they can have a material positive or negative result on net income. For these reasons, management removes realized investment gains and losses when it views its segment operations.

Management removes items that are related to prior periods when evaluating the operating results of current periods. Management also removes non-operating items unrelated to its core insurance activities when evaluating those results. Therefore, these items are excluded in its presentation of segment results, because accounting guidance requires that operating segment results be presented as management views its business. With the exception of the administrative settlements noted in the paragraphs above, all of these items are included in “Other operating expense” in the

Consolidated Statements of Operations

for the appropriate year. See additional detail below in the tables.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management at Torchmark Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis. As a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting, the Company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

Management evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and based on its assessment, determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2018

. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Torchmark Corporation (McKinney, Texas)

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries (“Torchmark”) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, Torchmark maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 of Torchmark and our report dated

February 28, 2019

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

Basis for Opinion

Torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
