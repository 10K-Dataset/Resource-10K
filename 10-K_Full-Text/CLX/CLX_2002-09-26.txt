PART
I

ITEM l. 
BUSINESS

(a)  GENERAL
DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

The Company (the term
"Company" as used herein includes the registrant identified on the
facing sheet, The Clorox Company, and its subsidiaries, unless the
context indicates otherwise) was originally founded in Oakland,
California in 1913 as the Electro-Alkaline Company.  It was
reincorporated as Clorox Chemical Corporation in 1922, as Clorox
Chemical Co. in 1928, and as The Clorox Company (an Ohio
corporation) in 1957, when the business was acquired by The Procter
& Gamble Company.  The Company was fully divested by The
Procter & Gamble Company in 1969 and, as an independent
company, was reincorporated in 1973 in California as The Clorox
Company.  In 1986, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware.
In January 1999 the Company acquired First Brands
Corporation.

For recent business
developments, refer to the information set forth under the caption
"Management's Discussion and Analysis," on pages A-2 through A-18
of Exhibit 99-1 hereto, incorporated herein by
reference.

(b)  FINANCIAL
INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

In fiscal year 2002, the
Company amended its segment definitions.  The Company has
three business segments: Household Products—North America,
Household Products—Latin America/Other and Specialty
Products.  Financial information for each of the
Company’s segments for the last three fiscal years, including
net sales, earnings before income taxes, cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle and identifiable assets is described
in Note 18 – Industry Segment Information of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in pages A-47,
A-48 and A-49 of Exhibit 99-1hereto, incorporated herein by
reference.

(c)  NARRATIVE
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

The Company's business
operations, represented by the aggregate of its Household
Products—North America, Household Products—Latin
America/Other and Specialty Products segments, include the
production and marketing of non-durable consumer products sold
primarily through grocery and other retail stores.  For the
most part, the factors necessary for an understanding of these
three segments are essentially the
same.

PRINCIPAL
PRODUCTS.

The Household
Products—North America segment includes the Company's
household cleaning, bleach and other home care products, water
filtration products, food storage and trash disposal categories
marketed in the United States, and all products marketed in
Canada.  The Household Products—Latin America/Other
segment includes the Company’s operations outside the United
States and Canada, exports and Puerto Rico, excluding European
automotive care, and primarily focuses on the laundry, household
cleaning, automotive care, insecticides (Brazil and Korea) and food
storage and trash disposal categories.  Finally, the 
Specialty Products segment includes the Company's charcoal, United
States and European automotive care, cat litter, insecticides,
dressings and sauces, and professional products categories. 
Principal products, by segment, currently marketed in the United
States and internationally are listed in Exhibit 13 hereto. 
Each of the Company's segments accounted for more than 10 percent
of the Company's consolidated revenues during the last threefiscal
years, as shown in Note 18 – Industry Segment Information of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears on
pages A-47, A-48 and A-49 of Exhibit 99-1 hereto, incorporated
herein by reference.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS -
METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION.

Most
non-durable household consumer products are nationally advertised
and sold within the United States to grocery stores through a
network of brokers and sold to mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs,
military and other retail stores primarily through a direct sales
force.  Within the United States, the Company also sells 
institutional versions of specialty food and non-food
products.  Outside the United States, the Company sells
consumer products through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and
joint-venture arrangements with local partners.

SOURCES AND
AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.

The
Company has obtained ample supplies of all required raw materials
and packaging supplies, and, with few exceptions, they were
available from a wide variety of sources during fiscal year
2002.  Polyethylene resin raw materials, which are
particularly important for the Household Products-North America
segment, were available from a sufficient number of sources during
fiscal year 2002.  Contingency plans have been developed for
any significant raw materials sourced from a single
supplier.

PATENTS AND
TRADEMARKS.

Although some products
are covered by patents, the Company does not believe that patents,
patent licenses or similar arrangements are material to its
business.  Most of the Company's brand name consumer products
are protected by registered trademarks.  Its brand names and
trademarks are extremely important to its business, and the Company
pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent
infringements.

SEASONALITY.

The
Specialty Products segment is the only portion of the operations of
the Company that has any significant degree of seasonality. 
Most sales of the Company's charcoal briquets, insecticides, and
automotive appearance product lines occur in the first six months
of each calendar year.  Operating cash flow and short term
borrowings are used to build inventories in the off-season and to
extend terms to customers.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER
BACKLOG.

During fiscal years 2002,
2001 and 2000, revenues from the Company's sales of its products to
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliated companies were 23 percent,
20 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of the Company's
consolidated net sales.  Except for this relationship, the
Company is not dependent upon any other single customer or group of
affiliated customers.  Order backlog is not a significant
factor in the Company's business.

RENEGOTIATION.

None of the Company's operations is subject to renegotiation or
termination at the election of the federal
government.

COMPETITION.

The
markets for consumer products are highly competitive.  Most of
the Company's products compete with other nationally advertised
brands within each category and with "private label" brands and
"generic" non-branded products of grocery chains and wholesale
cooperatives.  Competition is encountered from similar and
alternative products, many of which are produced and marketed by
major national concerns having financial resources greater than
those of the Company.  Depending on the product, the Company's
products compete on price, quality or other benefits to
consumers.

A newly-introduced
consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually
encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures
for advertising and sales promotion.  If a product gains
consumer acceptance, it normally requires continuing advertising
and promotional support to maintain its relative market
position.

RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT.

The Company incurred
expenses of approximately $67 million, $67 million and $63 million
in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, on research
activities relating to the development of new products or the
maintenance and improvement of existing products.  None of
this research activity was customer-sponsored.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS.

Historically, the Company
has not made material capital expenditures for environmental
control facilities or to comply with environmental laws and
regulations.  However, in general, the Company does anticipate
spending increasing amounts annually for facility upgrades and for
environmental programs.  The amount of capital expenditures
for environmental compliance was not material in fiscal year 2002
and is not expected to be material in the next fiscal year. 
See the discussions of Environmental Matters Create Potential
Liability Risks in Item 1 below and Legal Proceedings in Item 3
below.

NUMBER OF PERSONS
EMPLOYED.

At the end of fiscal year
2002, the Company employed approximately 9,500
people.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS.

Except
for historical information, matters discussed in this Form 10-K,
including the “Management's Discussion and Analysis”
section and statements about future growth, are forward-looking
statements based on management's estimates, assumptions and
projections.  In addition, from time to time, the Company may
make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as
anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new
products, research and development activities, plans for
international expansion, acquisitions, and similar matters. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a
safe harbor for forward-looking statements.  In order to
comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company notes that a
variety of factors could cause the Company's actual results and
experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or
other expectations expressed in the Company's forward-looking
statements.  These forward-looking statements are
uncertain.  The risks and uncertainties that may affect
operations, performance, product development, and results of the
Company's business in a material way, some of which may be beyond
the control of the Company, include those discussed elsewhere in
this Form 10-K, marketplace conditions and events, and the
following:

VOLUME GROWTH WILL BE
DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE

.  Over 80
percent of the Company’s revenues come from mature markets
that are subject to increased competition.  If the Company is
unable to increase market share in existing product lines or
develop or acquire and successfully launch new products, it will
not achieve its growth objectives.

OPERATING RESULTS AND
NET EARNINGS MAY NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS.

The Company cannot be sure that
its operating results and net earnings will meet its
expectations.  If the Company’s assumptions and
estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the
Company does not achieve all of its key goals, then the
Company’s actual performance could vary materially from its
expectations.  The Company's operating results and net
earnings may be influenced by a number of factors, including the
following:

the introduction of new
products and line extensions by the Company or its
competitors;

the mix of products sold
in a given quarter;

the Company's ability to
control its internal costs and the cost of raw
materials;

significant increases in
energy costs;

the effectiveness of the
Company’s advertising, marketing and promotional
programs;

changes in product pricing
policies by the Company or its competitors;

the ability of the Company
to maintain and enhance profit margins in the face of a
consolidating retail environment;

changes of accounting
policies;

the ability of the Company
to achieve business plans, including volume growth and pricing
plans, despite high levels of competitive activity;

the ability to maintain
key customer relationships;

the ability of major
customers and other creditors to meet their obligations as they
come due;

the ability to
successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters, including
resolution of pending matters within current estimates;

the ability of the Company
to attract and retain qualified personnel;

disruptions associated
with staff reductions;

expenses for impairment
and obsolescence of property, plant and equipment in excess of
projections;

expenses for impairment of
goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and equity
investments in excess of projections;

significant increases in
the costs of key raw materials including but not limited to resin,
corrugated, chlorine and caustic (although the Company has tried to
limit the impact of these through contractual terms and other
means);

significant increases in
interest rates; and

the impact of general
economic conditions in the United States and in other countries in
which the Company currently does business.

In addition, sales volume
growth, whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth, can
place burdens on the Company's management resources and financial
controls that, in turn, can have a negative impact on operating
results and net earnings.  To some extent, the Company sets
its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues.  If
actual revenue falls short of these expectations, operating results
and net earnings are likely to be adversely
affected.

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO UNCERTAIN CONDITIONS IN
OVERSEAS MARKETS.

The
Company’s sales outside the United States were 18 percent of
net sales in fiscal year 2002.  The Company has been and will
continue to be facing substantial risks associated with having
foreign operations, including:

economic or political
instability in its overseas markets; and

fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates that may make the Company's products more
expensive in its foreign markets or negatively impact its sales or
earnings.

Largely as a result of
these risks the Company took substantial impairment charges related
to its international operations in fiscal year 2002 and may have to
take additional charges in the future.  Refer to the
information set forth under the captions “Household
Products-Latin America/Other” and “South America
Economic, Social and Political Conditions” in "Management's
Discussion and Analysis," on pages A-6, A-11 and A-12 of Exhibit
99-1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.  In addition,
these risks could have a significant impact on the Company's
ability to sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in
foreign markets and may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations or financial position.  The
Company seeks to limit its foreign currency exchange risks using
operational strategies (such as matching receipt and payment
currencies).  It also uses derivative instruments to mitigate
certain foreign exposures where such instruments are available at
reasonable cost to the Company, but cannot be sure that this
strategy will be successful.  In addition, the Company's
operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new
and different legal and regulatory requirements in local
jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing
local operations, credit risk of local customers and distributors,
and potentially adverse tax consequences.  The Company’s
small volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and
local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.

IMPLEMENTATION OF ERP
SYSTEM MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

The
Company is in the process of implementing enterprise resource
planning system software.  This software is designed to
improve internal systems and support business processes, including
order fulfillment.  If the Company fails to implement the
software successfully, its order fulfillment process, and therefore
its ability to take, ship, bill for and collect for orders, could
be adversely impacted.  To minimize risk, the Company has
dedicated substantial resources to this project and will implement
the software in a staged fashion.  As a result, the Company
will have to manage in a multiple system environment for a
significant period of time.  Employing multiple systems
increases the risk that system interfaces will fail, resulting in
loss of data or inability to process transactions.  It is
expected that the software will enable the Company to better
understand and control customer payments and deductions, and, as a
result, the Company is likely to be less tolerant of customer
deviations from its policies, which might result in friction
between the Company and certain customers.

INTEGRATION AND
MANAGEMENT OF ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

One of the Company's strategies is to increase its
sales volumes, earnings and the markets it serves through
acquisitions of, or joint ventures with, other businesses in the
United States and internationally.  There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, or profitably
manage additional companies or operations or that it will be able
to successfully integrate  future acquisitions  into its
operations or identify, negotiate and successfully manage joint
venture opportunities.  In addition, there can be no assurance
that companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created
will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve
sales levels and profitability that justify the investments
made.

DISPOSITION OF
NON-STRATEGIC BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

The Company engages in an ongoing review of its
portfolio of businesses. If it decides that a business no longer
supports the Company's strategic direction, the Company may attempt
to sell that business. There can be no assurance that any such
disposition will occur, that, if it occurs, it will be at a price
sufficient to recover the book value of the business disposed of or
that the proceeds will be sufficient to avoid reducing
earnings.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
DEPENDS ON CONTINUOUS AND SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCT
INTRODUCTIONS.

In most categories
in which the Company competes, there are frequent introductions of
new products and line extensions.  An important factor in the
Company's future performance will be its ability to identify
emerging consumer and technological trends and to maintain and
improve the competitiveness of its products.  The Company
cannot be sure that it will successfully achieve those goals. 
Continued product development and marketing efforts have inherent
risks, including development delays, the failure of new products
and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market
acceptance, and the cost of failed product
introductions.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
COULD IMPOSE MATERIAL COSTS.

Generally, the manufacture, packaging, storage, distribution
and labeling of the Company's products and the Company's business
operations all must comply with extensive federal, state, and
foreign laws and regulations.  For example, in the United
States, many of the Company's products are regulated by the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration
and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Most states have
agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. 
The failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in these
or other areas, including tax laws, could subject the Company to
civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset
seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Loss of
or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could
delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product demand,
introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new
businesses and could adversely affect operating results.  It
is possible that the government will increase regulation of the
transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals, to enhance
homeland security or protect the environment and that such
regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or
costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
CREATE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RISKS.

The Company must comply with various environmental laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including
those relating to air emissions, water discharges, the handling and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of
contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous
substances.

The Company
handles hazardous chemicals in quantity at its plant sites.  A
release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act
could result in substantial liability for the Company to
governmental authorities or to third parties.

The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur,
capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying
with environmental laws and regulations in the United States and
internationally.  The Company is currently involved in or has
potential liability with respect to the remediation of past
contamination in the operation of some of its presently and
formerly owned and leased facilities.  In addition, some of
the Company's present and former facilities have been or had been
in operation for many years, and over that time, some of these
facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of
wastes that are or may be considered hazardous.  It is
possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third
parties to which the Company has sent waste, may in the future be
identified and become the subject of remediation.  It is
possible that the Company could become subject to additional
environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or
financial condition.

FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD IMPACT OUR
COMPETITIVENESS.

The Company relies
on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect
its intellectual property.  The Company cannot be sure that
these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in
the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or
challenged.  In addition, laws of some of the foreign
countries in which the Company's products are or may be sold do not
protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States.  The failure of the
Company to protect its proprietary information and any successful
intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings
against the Company could make it less competitive and could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating
results and financial condition.  There is a risk that the
Company will not be able to develop, locate and, where appropriate,
license necessary technology to support new product
introductions.  It is also possible that the Company will be
deemed to have violated intellectual property rights granted to
others.  For example, a competitor has asserted that elements
of the

Clorox

ReadyMop®

self-contained mopping
system may infringe existing patents or patents that may issue from
pending applications.

VOLATILITY IN THE
INSURANCE MARKET MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND REDUCED
COVERAGE.

The Company will seek to
renew or replace various contracts for insurance coverage during
the year.  Trends in the insurance industry suggest that such
contracts may be much more expensive, less protective or even
unavailable.  In such a case the Company may decide to
self-insure more, thereby undertaking additional
risks.

The foregoing list of
important factors is not all-inclusive.  The forward-looking
statements are and will be based on management’s then current
views and assumptions regarding future events and operating
performance and speak only as of their dates.  The Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise.

(d) 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
OPERATIONS.

The following table shows
net sales and assets by geographic area for the last three fiscal
years:

ITEM 2. 
PROPERTIES

PRODUCTION
FACILITIES.

The Company operates
production and major warehouse facilities for its operations in 26
locations throughout the United States and in 29 locations
internationally.  Most of the space is owned. 
Warehousing space is leased from public service warehouses around
the United States.  Domestically the Company also utilizes six
domestic regional distribution centers for many of the Company's
products, which are operated by service providers.  The
Company closed its manufacturing facilities in Wrens, Ga. and Moose
Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada in fiscal year 2002.  As part of the
Himolene sale in fiscal year 2002, the Company divested its Tupelo,
Miss. manufacturing facility and assigned its leases at its Bell,
Calif. and West Chicago manufacturing facilities.  The
Himolene sale is discussed further on page A-8 of Exhibit 99-1
hereto.  The Company has announced plans to close its
manufacturing facilities in Bedford Park, Ill. during fiscal year
2003.  The Company considers its manufacturing and warehousing
facilities to be adequate to support its business.

OFFICES AND R&D
FACILITIES.

The Company owns its
general office building located in Oakland, Calif.  The
Company also owns its Technical Center and Data Center located in
Pleasanton, Calif.  The Company leases its research and
development center and its engineering research facility for

Glad®

and

GladWare®

products, which are
located in Willowbrook, Ill., and Kennesaw, Ga.,
respectively.  The Company owns a research and development
facility at its plant in Aldo Bonzi, Argentina.  The Company
also leases its research and development center for

STP®

products located in Brookfield, Conn. and for

Armor All®

products located in Walnut Creek, Calif.  Leased sales and
other office facilities are located at a number of other
locations.

ENCUMBRANCES

. 
None of the Company's owned facilities are encumbered to secure
debt owed by the Company, except that the manufacturing facility in
Belle, Mo. secures industrial revenue bond indebtedness incurred in
relation to the construction and upgrade thereof.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

The Company is involved in
certain environmental matters, including Superfund and other
response actions at various locations, the most significant of
which relates to historical disposals of wood tars  by a
predecessor of the Company’s Kingsford Products Company
subsidiary during the 1950’s in and around the City of
Kingsford, Mich.  Although no formal proceedings are pending,
response actions at the Michigan site are being performed by the
Company and the Ford Motor Company under the supervision of the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

The potential cost to the
Company related to ongoing environmental matters is uncertain due
to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and
clean-up costs; the complexity and evolving nature of laws and
regulations and their interpretations; and the timing, varying
costs and effectiveness of alternative clean-up technologies. 
Based on its experience, the Company does not expect that such
costs individually or in the aggregate will represent a material
cost to the Company in excess of amounts already accrued or affect
its competitive position.   As of June 30, 2002, $16.7
million was accrued for such probable future costs, without
discounting for present value.

ITEM 4. 
SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY
HOLDERS

None.
