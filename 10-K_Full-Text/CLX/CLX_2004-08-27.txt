PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

(a)    GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

The Company (the term “Company” as used herein includes The Clorox
Company (the registrant identified on the facing sheet) and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise) was originally founded in
Oakland, California in 1913 as the Electro-Alkaline Company. It was reincorporated as Clorox Chemical Corporation in 1922, as Clorox Chemical Co. in
1928 and as The Clorox Company (an Ohio corporation) in 1957, when the business was acquired by The Procter & Gamble Company. The Company was fully
divested by The Procter & Gamble Company in 1969 and, as an independent company, was reincorporated in 1973 in California as The Clorox Company. In
1986, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. In January 1999, the Company acquired First Brands Corporation.

For recent business developments, refer to the information set forth under the
caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” on pages A-2 through A-18 of Exhibit 99-1 hereto, incorporated herein by
reference.

(b)    FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY
SEGMENTS.

The Company has three business segments: Household Products—North America,
Specialty Products, and Household Products — Latin America/Other. Financial information for each of the Company’s segments for the last three
fiscal years, including net sales, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, and identifiable assets is described in Note 19 —
Industry Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears on pages A-48, A-49 and A-50 of Exhibit 99-1 hereto,
incorporated herein by reference. Each of the Company’s segments accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company’s consolidated revenues
during the last three fiscal years.

(c)    NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

The Company’s business operations, represented by the aggregate of its
Household Products — North America, Specialty Products, and Household Products — Latin America/Other, include the production and marketing of
consumer products sold primarily through grocery, mass merchandise, club and other retail stores. For the most part, the factors necessary for an
understanding of these three segments are essentially the same.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS.

The products of the Household Products — North
America segment include: (a) plastic bags, wraps and containers, under the Glad brand, (b) home care cleaning products such as disinfecting sprays and
wipes, toilet bowl cleaners, dilutable, spray and gel household cleaners, glass and surface cleaners, carpet cleaners, reusable cleaning cloths, drain
openers and septic-system treatments, steel-wool soap pads and scrubber sponges, mildew removers, soap scum and bathroom cleaners, daily shower
cleaners and pre-moistened towelettes, primarily under the brands Clorox, Formula 409, Pine-Sol, Tilex, Soft Scrub and S.O.S, (c) laundry products,
such as liquid bleaches, laundry stain removers and dry and liquid color-safe bleaches under the brands Clorox and Clorox 2, and (d) water filtration
systems and filters under the Brita brand.

The products of the Specialty Products segment include: (a) auto care products such
as protectants, cleaners and wipes, tire- and wheel-care products and washes, automotive fuel and oil additives and appearance products, primarily
under the Armor All and STP brands; (b) cat litter products such as clumping cat litter, scoopable and silica-gel crystals cat litter, primarily under
the Fresh Step and Scoop Away brands; (c) food products such as salad dressings and dip mixes; seasoned mini-croutons, seasonings, sauces, and
marinades, primarily under the Hidden Valley and K C Masterpiece brands; (d) seasonal products such as charcoal briquets, charcoal lighter and wood
chips under the Kingsford and Match Light brands and insecticides under the Combat brand and (e) products for institutional markets such as bleaches,
toilet bowl cleaners, disinfectants, disinfecting sprays and wipes, dilutable cleaners, insecticides, cleaners, food-storage bags, wraps, trash bags,
dressings, barbecue sauces, charcoal briquets, clog removers, cleaners, steel-wool soap pads, mild-abrasive liquid cleansers, mildew removers, soap
scum removers and bathroom cleaners.


The products of the Household Products — Latin America/Other segment include:
(a) in the Asia-Pacific region: bleaches, insecticides, disposable gloves, cleaning cloths, floor cleaners, sponges and scourers, non-stick baking
paper, ice cube bags, non-stick frying pan sheets, aluminum foil, foil trays, plastic covers, oven bags, reclosable bags, paste cleaner, food bags,
cling films, trash bags, coolant concentrates, brake fluids and sponges, primarily under the Glad, Chux, Home Mat, Armor All, Combat, Clorox and Handy
Andy brands and (b) in the Latin American region: laundry additives, waxes, bleaches, spray and gel cleaners, liquid household cleaners, toilet bowl
cleaners, bathroom cleaners, disinfecting sprays, cleaning utensils, brooms, candles, air fresheners, and fabric refreshers primarily distributed under
the Clorox, Ayudín, Limpido, Clorinda, Los Conejos, Poett, Mistolin, Lestoil and Bon Bril brands.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS — METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION.

Most non-durable household
consumer products are nationally advertised and sold within the United States to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers primarily through a network of
brokers and to mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, military and other retail stores primarily through a direct sales force. Within the United States,
the Company also sells institutional versions of many of its products. Outside the United States, the Company sells consumer products to the retail
trade through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and joint-venture arrangements with local partners.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.

The Company purchases raw
materials, packaging supplies, transportation and other services, products and energy from numerous unaffiliated firms. Interruptions in the delivery
of these materials or services could adversely impact the Company. Significant raw materials were available from a sufficient number of sources during
fiscal year 2004. Contingency plans have been developed for any significant raw materials sourced from a single supplier.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS.

Most of the Company’s brand name consumer
products are protected by registered trademarks. Its brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business and the Company pursues a course
of vigorous action against apparent infringements. The Company’s patents, patent licenses and similar arrangements are also material to its
business and are defended against apparent infringements.

SEASONALITY.

Most sales of the Company’s charcoal briquets,
insecticides, foods and automotive appearance product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year. Operating cash flow is used to build
inventories of those products in the off-season. The Household Products — North America segment does not have a significant degree of
seasonality.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG.

During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
revenues from the Company’s sales of its products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliated companies were 25 percent, 25 percent and 23
percent, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Except for this relationship, the Company is not dependent upon any other single
customer or group of affiliated customers. Order backlog is not a significant factor in the Company’s business.

RENEGOTIATION.

None of the Company’s operations is subject to
renegotiation or termination at the election of the federal government.

COMPETITION.

The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. Most
of the Company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands and
“generic” non-branded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives. Competition is encountered from similar and alternative
products, many of which are produced and marketed by major national concerns having financial resources greater than those of the Company. Depending on
the product, the Company’s products compete on price, quality or other benefits to consumers. A newly introduced consumer product (whether
improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and sales promotion. If a
product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market
position.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

The Company incurred expenses of approximately $84
million, $76 million and $66 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, on research activities relating to the development of new
products or the maintenance and improvement of existing products. None of this research activity was customer-sponsored.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

In general, the Company anticipates spending
increasing amounts annually for facility upgrades and for environmental programs. The amount of capital expenditures for environmental


compliance was approximately $4 million in fiscal year 2004 and is not expected to
be material in the next fiscal year. For non-capital expenditures, see the discussions of Environmental Matters Create Potential Liability Risks below
and Legal Proceedings in Item 3 below.

NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED.

At the end of fiscal year 2004, the Company
employed approximately 8,600 people.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS.

Except for historical
information, matters discussed in this Form 10-K, including the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” section and statements about
future growth, are forward-looking statements based on management’s estimates, assumptions and projections. In addition, from time to time, the
Company may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new products, research
and development activities, plans for international expansion, acquisitions and similar matters. Words such as “expects,”
“anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
“seeks,” “estimates,” variations on such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the
safe harbor, the Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the Company’s actual results and experience to differ materially from the
anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are mere
predictions and are uncertain. The risks and uncertainties that may affect operations, performance, product development and results of the
Company’s business in a material way, some of which may be beyond the control of the Company, include those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K,
marketplace conditions and events, and the following:

VOLUME GROWTH MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

A large percentage of the
Company’s revenues come from mature markets that are subject to increased competition. If the Company is unable to increase market share in
existing product lines or develop or acquire and successfully launch new products, it may not achieve its growth objectives.

OPERATING RESULTS AND NET EARNINGS MAY NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS.

The Company
cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations. If the Company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or
do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of its key goals, then the Company’s actual performance could vary materially from
its expectations. The Company’s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors, including the following:

•

the introduction of new products and line extensions by the
Company or its competitors;

•

the mix of products with varying profitability sold in a given
quarter;

•

the Company’s ability to control its internal
costs;

•

the effectiveness of the Company’s advertising, marketing
and promotional programs;

•

changes in product pricing policies by the Company or its
competitors;

•

the ability of the Company to maintain and enhance profit
margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment;

•

the ability of the Company to achieve business plans, including
volume growth and pricing plans, despite high levels of competitive activity;

•

the ability to maintain key customer relationships;

•

the potential inability to generate expected cost savings and
efficiencies from the Company’s new enterprise resource planning and customer relationship data processing systems;

•

the potential inability to generate expected cost savings and
efficiencies from restructuring the Company’s supply chain;

•

the ability of major customers and other debtors to meet their
obligations as they come due;


•

the failure of parties contracting with the Company to perform
their obligations and the loss of or inability to renew contracts of importance to the Company’s performance;

•

the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal
matters, including resolution of pending matters within current estimates;

•

changes to cash flow resulting from tax payments, tax
settlements and share repurchases;

•

expenses for impairment and obsolescence of property, plant and
equipment in excess of projections;

•

expenses for impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other
intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections;

•

charges resulting from any restructuring that management may,
from time to time, choose to undertake;

•

the potential exercise by The Procter & Gamble Company of
its option to purchase an additional 10% interest in the profits, losses and cash flow of the Glad business (option available through January 1,
2008);

•

significant increases in the costs of key raw materials
including but not limited to energy, resin, corrugated boxes and cartons, chlorine, soy bean oil, caustic soda and other miscellaneous
chemicals;

•

changes of accounting policies;

•

significant increases in interest rates, employee benefit costs,
or insurance costs;

•

the impact of environmental remediation costs;

•

the impact of currency devaluations and fluctuations (in
particular, but not limited to, the Venezuelan Bolivar); and

•

the impact of general economic conditions in the United States
and in other countries in which the Company currently does business.

In addition, sales volume growth, whether due to acquisitions or to internal
growth, can place burdens on the Company’s management resources and financial controls that, in turn, can have a negative impact on operating
results and net earnings. To some extent, the Company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues. If actual revenue falls short of
these expectations, operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected.

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO UNCERTAIN CONDITIONS
IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

The Company’s sales outside the United States were 15 percent of net sales in fiscal year 2004. The Company has been
and will continue to be facing substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including:

•

economic or political instability in its international markets;
and

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may make
the Company’s products more expensive in its international markets or negatively impact sales or earnings.

Refer to the information set forth under the caption “South America Economic
and Political Conditions” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis;” on page A-11 of Exhibit 99-1 hereto, incorporated herein by
reference and refer to the information set forth under the caption “Market-Sensitive Derivatives and Financial Instruments” in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis;” on pages A-12 and A-13 of Exhibit 99-1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.

These factors contributed to the Company taking substantial impairment charges
related to its international operations in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and, due to uncertainties and possible deterioration in the overseas markets, the
Company may have to take additional charges in the future. In addition, these risks could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to
sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial position. The Company’s small volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could
exacerbate such risks. Also, the Company’s operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new and different legal and


regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing
and managing local operations, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.

THE POTENTIAL SALE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK BY HENKEL MAY IMPACT FINANCIAL
RESULTS.

In December 2003, Henkel KGaA (“Henkel”) announced that it may sell some or all of its 29% stake in the Company to finance it
acquisition of The Dial Corporation. Pending further developments, the Company temporarily suspended its share repurchases in December 2003. The
Company is discussing with Henkel its plans with respect to its interest in the Company’s shares. The outcome of these discussions is not known at
this time. If the Company reacquires a portion or all of the Company’s shares held by Henkel, the financial position and cash flows of the Company
could be materially impacted.

RESOLUTIONS OF TAX DISPUTES MAY IMPACT EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW.

Significant
judgment is required in determining the Company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes accruals for
certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that the Company’s tax return positions are fully supported, the Company believes that certain
positions will be challenged and that the Company’s positions may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of
changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Company’s effective tax rate includes
the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals, including related interest and penalties, as considered appropriate by management.
When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters
could be recognized as a reduction to the Company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue
could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. For additional information, refer to the information
set forth under the caption “Contingencies” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” on page A-12 of Exhibit 99-1 hereto,
incorporated herein by reference.

IDENTIFICATION OF GOOD ACQUISITION CANDIDATES MAY BE DIFFICULT AND INTEGRATION
AND MANAGEMENT OF ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

One of the elements of the Company’s growth plan is to look at the possibility of
increasing its sales volumes, earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of, or joint ventures with, other businesses in the United States
and internationally. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, or profitably manage additional companies or
operations or that it will be able successfully to integrate future acquisitions into its operations or to identify, negotiate and manage joint venture
opportunities. In addition, there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created will be profitable at their
inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON CONTINUOUS AND SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCT
INTRODUCTIONS.

In most categories in which the Company competes, there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions. An important
factor in the Company’s future performance will be its ability to identify emerging consumer and technological trends and to maintain and improve
the competitiveness of its products. The Company cannot be sure that it will successfully achieve those goals. Continued product development and
marketing efforts have inherent risks, including development delays, the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of
market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD IMPOSE MATERIAL COSTS.

Generally, the
manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution of the Company’s products and the conduct of the Company’s business operations
must all comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the United States, many of the Company’s products
are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Most states have
agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. The failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas could
subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the
Company from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect
operating results, particularly with respect to the Company’s charcoal business. It is possible that the government will increase regulation of
the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could
negatively impact raw material supply or costs.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS CREATE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RISKS.

The Company must
comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water
discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of
hazardous substances. The Company handles hazardous chemicals in quantity at its plant sites. A release of such chemicals due to accident or an
intentional act could result in substantial liability for the Company to governmental authorities or to third parties. The Company has incurred, and
will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing
physical security for its worldwide operations. The Company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past
contamination in the operation of some of its presently and formerly owned and leased facilities. In addition, some of the Company’s present and
former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years, and over that time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to
which the Company has sent waste, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. It is possible that the Company could become
subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial condition.

FAILURE TO MAXIMIZE OR TO SUCCESSFULLY ASSERT THE COMPANY’S INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD IMPACT ITS COMPETITIVENESS.

The Company relies on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its
intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully
asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights
necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or
challenged in the future. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which the
Company’s products are or may be sold do not protect the Company’s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States. The failure of the Company to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make it less competitive and could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.

IF THE COMPANY IS FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF
OTHERS IT COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVENESS.

It is possible that the Company will be found to have violated the trademark, trade
secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others. Such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark, trade
secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company’s business and to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. It could also be
necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holder is willing to permit the Company to continue to use the intellectual property
right. Either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.

VOLATILITY IN THE INSURANCE MARKET MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND REDUCED
COVERAGE.

The Company will seek to renew or replace various contracts for insurance coverage during the year. Trends in the insurance industry
suggest that such contracts may be much more expensive, less protective or even unavailable. In such a case the Company may decide to self-insure more,
thereby undertaking additional risks.

The foregoing list of important factors is not all-inclusive. The forward-looking
statements are and will be based on management’s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak
only as of their dates. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events, or otherwise.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

The Company owns and operates 22
manufacturing facilities in the United States, 9 of which serve primarily the Household Products — North America segment and 13 of which
serve primarily the Specialty Products segment. On August 4, 2004 the Company announced its intention to close the Glad plant in Cartersville, Georgia
by the end of fiscal year 2005 pending an agreement with the union that represents the employees there. The Company owns and operates 25 manufacturing
facilities internationally, which serve primarily the Household Products — Latin America/Other segment. The Company also leases 6
regional distribution centers in the United States which serve primarily the Household Products — North America and Specialty Products
segments, and owns and operates regional distribution centers in Canada and Chile, which serve primarily the Household Products — North
America and Household Products — Latin America/Other segments, respectively. Management believes that the Company’s production and
distribution facilities, together with additional facilities owned or leased and operated by various unaffiliated finished product suppliers and
distribution center service providers that serve the Company, are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the Company’s properties
and equipment have been well maintained.

OFFICES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES.

The Company owns its
general office building located in Oakland, California. The Company also owns its Technical Center and Data Center located in Pleasanton, California.
The Company leases its research and development center and its engineering research facility for Glad and GladWare brand products, which are located in
Willowbrook, Illinois, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Kennesaw, Georgia. The Company owns a research and development facility at its plant in Aldo Bonzi,
Argentina. The Company also leases its research and development center for STP brand products located in Brookfield, Connecticut and for Armor All
brand products located in Walnut Creek, California. Leased sales and other office facilities are located at a number of other locations.

ENCUMBRANCES

. None of the Company’s owned facilities are encumbered to
secure debt owed by the Company.


ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is involved in certain environmental matters, including Superfund and
other response actions at various locations, the most significant of which relates to historical disposals of wood tars by a predecessor of the
Company’s subsidiary, The Kingsford Products Company, during the 1950’s in and around the City of Kingsford, Michigan. Although no formal
governmental proceedings are pending, response actions at the Michigan site are being performed by the Company and the Ford Motor Company under the
supervision of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The Company and Ford Motor Company currently are negotiating with state authorities on
a consent judgment that will define certain remediation goals and obligations relating to this matter.

The potential cost to the Company related to ongoing environmental matters is
uncertain due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and clean-up costs; the complexity and evolving nature of laws and
regulations and their interpretations; and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative clean-up technologies. As of June 30, 2004, $27.9
million was accrued for such probable future costs, without discounting for present value.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

The Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors reported in fiscal
year 2002 that, because of a consulting engagement between the Company and Deloitte Consulting, the engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
Company’s auditors would be terminated unless Deloitte & Touche LLP and Deloitte Consulting separated from each other before December 31,
2002. The proposed split between the two Deloitte organizations did not occur by that date. The Audit Committee, therefore, dismissed Deloitte &
Touche LLP on February 15, 2003, after the review of the Company’s financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 had been
completed.

Deloitte & Touche LLP’s report on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was
not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

The decision to change accountants was made by the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company.

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 and the subsequent period
through February 15, 2003, there were no disagreements (as that term is used in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) between the Company and Deloitte
& Touche LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte & Touche LLP, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreement(s) in connection with its reports.

There have been no “reportable events” (as that term is used in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K) during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 and the subsequent period through February 15, 2003.

The Audit Committee, after reviewing proposals from those accounting firms without
prohibited conflicts and conducting interviews with those firms, on February 15, 2003, engaged Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditors for
fiscal year 2003.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the specified time periods. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company, with the participation of the
Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the


Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2004 and, based on
that evaluation, which disclosed no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, there have not been any significant changes in the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls over financial reporting, except that as part of the
Company’s implementation of enterprise resource planning system software, the Company has implemented the SAP system for certain US manufacturing
operations, resulting in new internal control procedures in selected processing areas.
