PART I

ITEM l.  BUSINESS

(a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

The Company (the term "Company" as used herein includes the registrant
identified on the facing sheet, The Clorox Company, and its subsidiaries,
unless the context indicates otherwise) was originally founded in
Oakland, California in 1913 as the Electro-Alkaline Company.  It was
reincorporated as Clorox Chemical Corporation in 1922, as Clorox
Chemical Co. in 1928, and as The Clorox Company (an Ohio corporation)
in 1957, when the business was acquired by The Procter & Gamble Company.
The Company was fully divested by The Procter & Gamble Company in 1969
and, as an independent company, was reincorporated in 1973 in California
as The Clorox Company.  In 1986, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware.

During fiscal year 2000, the Company continued to focus on expanding
its business through internal development of new products and line
extensions of existing products.  The Company introduced 114 new products
during fiscal year 2000, including Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, Clorox
Disinfecting Spray, Ultra Clorox liquid bleach, Liquid-Plumr Foaming
Pipe Snake drain cleaner, and Fresh Step Crystals cat litter.  The
Company also focused on completing the integration of the product lines
it acquired in its merger with First Brands Corporation in fiscal year
1999.

Internationally, the Company made three acquisitions in fiscal year
2000, consisting of the Bon Bril cleaning utensil business in Colombia,
Venezuela and Peru, the Agrocom S.A. distribution business in Argentina,
and the Astra rubber glove business in Australia.  The Company also
increased its equity ownership in Clorox de Colombia S.A.(formerly
"Tecnoclor, S.A.") in Colombia from 72% to 100%.  The Company
restructured its operations in Asia, moving to third-party distributors
in many regions.

For other recent business developments, refer to the information set
forth under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis," on
pages B-1 through B-9 of Exhibit 99 hereto, and pages B-1 through B-9
of Appendix B of the Company's definitive Proxy Statement for the
2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, which will be
filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
within 120 days after the end of the registrant's fiscal year ended
June 30, 2000 ("Proxy Statement"), incorporated herein by
reference.

(b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

The Company has three business segments: U.S Household Products and
Canada, U.S. Specialty Products and International.  Financial information
for the last three fiscal years, including net sales, earnings before
taxes, and identifiable assets, attributable to each of the Company's
industry segments is set forth in Note 17 - Industry Segment Information
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears on
page B-31 of Exhibit 99 hereto, and on page B-31 of  Appendix B of the
Proxy Statement, incorporated herein by reference.



(c)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

The Company's business operations, represented by the aggregate of its U.S.
Household Products and Canada, U.S. Specialty Products and International
segments, include the production and marketing of non-durable consumer
products sold primarily through grocery and other retail stores.  For the
most part, the factors necessary for an understanding of these three
segments are essentially the same.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS.  The U.S. Household Products and Canada segment
includes the Company's household cleaning, bleach and other home care
products, water filtration products marketed in the United States, and
all products marketed in Canada.  The U.S. Specialty Products segment
includes the Company's charcoal, automotive care, cat litter,
insecticide, fire log, dressings, sauces, professional products, and
food storage and disposal categories.  Finally, the International segment,
which includes the Company's overseas operations (excluding Canada),
exports and Puerto Rico, primarily focuses on the laundry, household
cleaning, automotive care and food storage and disposal categories.
Principal products, by segment, currently marketed in the United States
and internationally are listed on pages 13 and 14 of the Company's Annual
Report incorporated herein by reference.  Each of the Company's segments
accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company's consolidated revenues
during the last three fiscal years, as shown in Note 17 - Industry Segment
Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which
appears on page B-31 of Exhibit 99 hereto, and on page B-31 of Appendix B
of the Proxy Statement, incorporated herein by reference.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS - METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION.  Most non-durable household
consumer products are nationally advertised and sold within the United
States to grocery stores through a network of brokers, and to mass
merchandisers, warehouse clubs, military and other retail stores
primarily through a direct sales force.  The Company also sells
within the United States institutional versions of specialty food
and non-food products.  Outside the United States, the Company sells
consumer products through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and
joint-venture arrangements with local partners.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.  The Company has obtained
ample supplies of all required raw materials and packaging supplies
which, with a few exceptions, were available from a wide variety of
sources during fiscal year 2000.  Polyethylene resin raw materials,
which are particularly important for the U.S. Specialty Products
segment, were available from a wide variety of sources during fiscal
year 2000 and the Company has entered into financial instruments with
various maturities partially to stabilize the cost of its polyethylene
resin requirements.  Contingency plans have been developed for any
major single-sourced supplier materials.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS.  Although some products are covered by
patents, the Company does not believe that patents, patent licenses
or similar arrangements are material to its business.  Most of the
Company's brand name consumer products are protected by registered
trademarks.  Its brand names and trademarks are extremely important
to its business and the Company pursues a course of vigorous action
against apparent infringements.

SEASONALITY.  The U.S. Specialty Products segment is the only
portion of the operations of the Company that has any significant
degree of seasonality.  Most sales of the Company's charcoal
briquets, insecticides, and automotive appearance product lines
occur in the first six months of each calendar year.  Working
capital to carry inventories built up in the off-season and to
extend terms to customers is generally provided by internally
generated funds plus commercial paper lines of credit.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG.  During fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
1998, revenues from the Company's sales of its products to Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. and its affiliated companies were 18%, 18%, and 15%,
respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales.  Except for
this relationship, the Company is not dependent upon any other single
customer or a small group of customers.  Order backlog is not a
significant factor in the Company's business.

RENEGOTIATION.  None of the Company's operations is subject to
renegotiation or termination at the election of the feral government.

COMPETITION.  The markets for consumer products are highly competitive
and most of the Company's products compete with other nationally
advertised brands within each category, and with "private label" brands
and "generic" non-branded products of grocery chains and wholesale
cooperatives.  Competition is encountered from similar and alternative
products, many of which are produced and marketed by major national
concerns having financial resources greater than those of the Company.
Depending on the competitive product, the Company's products compete
on price, quality or other benefits to consumers.

A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed)
usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures
for advertising and sales promotion.  If a product gains consumer
acceptance, it normally requires continuing advertising and
promotional support to maintain its relative market position.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  The Company incurred expenses of approximately
$63 million, $63 million and $62 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively, on research activities relating to the
development of new products or the maintenance and improvement of
existing products.  None of this research activity was customer-sponsored.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  Historically, the Company has not made
material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
or to comply with environmental laws and regulations.  However, in
general, the Company does anticipate spending increasing amounts
annually for facility upgrades and for environmental programs.  The
amount of capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not
material in fiscal year 2000 and is not expected to be material in
the next fiscal year.

The Company is involved in certain other environmental matters,
including Superfund clean-up efforts at various locations.  The
potential cost to the Company related to ongoing environmental
matters is uncertain due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude
of possible pollution and clean-up costs; the complexity and
evolving nature of laws and regulations and their interpretations;
and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative
clean-up technologies.  Based on its experience and without offsetting
for expected insurance recoveries or discounting for present
value, the Company does not expect that such costs individually
and in the aggregate will represent a material cost to the Company
or affect its competitive position.

NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED.  At the end of fiscal year 2000,
approximately 11,000 people were employed by the Company.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS.  Except for historical
information, matters discussed in this Form 10-K, including the
Management's Discussion and Analysis and statements about future
growth, are forward-looking statements based on management's estimates,
assumptions and projections.  In addition, from time to time, the
Company may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters
as anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new
products, research and development activities, plans for international
expansion, acquisitions, and similar matters.  The Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking
statements.  In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the
Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the Company's
actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated
results or other expectations expressed in the Company's forward-looking
statements.  These forward-looking statements are uncertain.  The
risks and uncertainties that may affect operations, performance,
product development, and results of the Company's business, some of
which may be beyond the control of the Company, include those discussed
elsewhere in this Form 10-K, marketplace conditions and events, and
the following:

QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE.  The Company cannot be sure
that its operating results will improve from quarter-to-quarter, or
that if any improvement is shown, the degree of improvement will
meet its expectations.  The Company's quarterly operating results
will be influenced by a number of factors, including the following:

* the introduction of new products and line extensions by the Company
  or its competitors;
* the mix of products sold in a given quarter;
* the Company's ability to control its internal costs and the cost of
  raw materials;
* significant increases in energy costs;
* changes in product pricing policies by the Company or its competitors;
* changes in accounting policies; or
* the impact of general economic conditions in the United States and
  in other countries in which the Company currently does business.

In addition, sales volume growth, whether due to acquisitions or to
internal growth, can place burdens on the Company's management
resources and financial controls that, in turn, can have a negative
impact on operating results.  To some extent, the Company sets its
expense levels in anticipation of future revenues.  If actual
revenue falls short of these expectations, operating results are
likely to be adversely affected.  Because of all of these factors,
the Company believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its
results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of
future performance.

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO UNCERTAIN
CONDITIONS IN OVERSEAS MARKETS.  The Company believes that its sales
outside the United States, which were 19% of net sales in fiscal year
2000, are likely to increase as a percentage of its total sales.  As
a result, the Company will increasingly face the risks created by
having foreign operations, including:

* economic or political instability in its overseas markets; and
* fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may make
  the Company's products more expensive in its foreign markets or
  negatively impact its sales or earnings.

All of these risks could have a significant impact on the Company's
ability to sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in
foreign markets and may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations or financial position.  The Company
seeks to limit its foreign currency exchange risks through the
use of foreign currency forward contracts when practical, but
cannot be sure that this strategy will be successful.  In addition,
the Company's operations outside the United States are subject
to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements
in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and
managing local operations, credit risk of local customers and
distributors, and potentially adverse tax consequences.

INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.  One
of the Company's strategies is to increase its sales volumes,
earnings and the markets it serves through the acquisition of,
or merger with, other businesses in the United States and
internationally.  There can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to identify, acquire, or profitably manage additional
companies or operations or successfully integrate recent or
future acquisitions or mergers into its operations.  In addition,
there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired
will be profitable at the time of their acquisition or will achieve
sales levels and profitability that justify the investment made.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON CONTINUOUS AND SUCCESSFUL NEW
PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS.  In most categories in which the Company
competes, there are frequent introductions of new products and
line extensions.  An important factor in the Company's future
performance will be its ability to identify emerging consumer
and technological trends and to maintain and improve the
competitiveness of its products.  The Company cannot be sure
that it will successfully achieve those goals.  Continued
product development and marketing efforts have all the risks
inherent in the development of new products and line extensions,
including development delays, the failure of new products and
line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance,
and the cost of failed product introductions.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD IMPOSE MATERIAL COSTS.  The
manufacture, packaging, storage, distribution and labeling of
the Company's products and the Company's business operations
generally all must comply with extensive federal, state, and
foreign laws and regulations.  For example, in the United States,
many of the Company's products are regulated by the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Most states have agencies
that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies.  The failure
to comply with applicable laws and regulations in these or other
areas, including taxes, could subject the Company to civil
remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures,
as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have
a material adverse effect on the Company.  Loss of or failure to
obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent
the Company from introducing new products, building new facilities
or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating
results.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS CREATE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RISKS.  The
Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations
in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those
relating to air emissions, water discharges, the handling and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and the remediation of
contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous
substances.  The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur,
capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying
with those laws and regulations in the United States and
internationally.  The Company is currently involved in or has
potential liability with respect to the remediation of past
contamination in the operation of some of its presently and formerly
owned and leased facilities.  In addition, some of the Company's
present and former facilities have been or had been in operation
for many years, and over that time, some of these facilities may
have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are
or may be considered hazardous.  It is possible that those sites,
as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which the
Company has sent waste, may in the future be identified and become
the subject of remediation.  It is possible that the Company could
become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the
future that could result in a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations or financial condition.

FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD IMPACT OUR
COMPETITIVENESS.  The Company relies on trademark, trade secret,
patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property.
The Company cannot be sure that these intellectual property
rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not
be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  In addition, laws
of some of the foreign countries in which the Company's products
are or may be sold do not protect the Company's intellectual
property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States.  The failure of the Company to protect its proprietary
information and any successful intellectual property challenges
or infringement proceedings against the Company could make it
less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, operating results and financial condition.
