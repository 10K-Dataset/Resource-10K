                           PART I



ITEM l.  BUSINESS  

(a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

The Company (the term "Company" as used herein includes the
registrant identified on the facing sheet, The Clorox 
Company, and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates
otherwise) was originally founded in Oakland, California in 
1913 as the Electro-Alkaline Company.  It was reincorporated
as Clorox Chemical Corporation in 1922, as Clorox Chemical 
Co. in 1928, and as The Clorox Company (an Ohio corporation)
in 1957, when the business was acquired by The Procter & 
Gamble Company.  The Company was fully divested by The 
Procter & Gamble Company in 1969 and, as an independent 
company, was reincorporated in 1973 in California as The 
Clorox Company.  In 1986, the Company was reincorporated 
in Delaware.

Portions of The Clorox Company Annual Report for the Year 
Ended June 30, 1997 ("Annual Report") to its stockholders 
are incorporated herein by specific reference.

During fiscal year 1997, the Company continued to focus on 
expanding its domestic business, through internal 
development of new products and line extensions of existing
products.  The Company introduced 15 new products in the 
U.S. during fiscal year 1997.  It also continued its 
strategy of considering strategic acquisitions and, in that
regard, entered the automotive appearance product market 
with its acquisition of Armor All Products Corporation 
during fiscal year 1997. 

Internationally, the Company continued the implementation 
of its strategy of expanding its laundry, household cleaning
and insecticide businesses to markets where these 
categories are not yet fully developed, but where it 
believes high potential exists.  The Company made three 
international acquisitions in fiscal year 1997, consisting 
of the "Limpido" brand of liquid bleach in Colombia, the 
"Pinoluz" brand of pine cleaner in Argentina, and the Shell
Group's insecticides and cleaning products business in 
Chile.   In addition, the Company introduced 24 new products
or line extensions in previously established international
operations.

(b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.
The Company's operations are predominantly in one segment 
- -- non-durable household consumer products.  Such operations
include the production and marketing of non-durable 
consumer products sold primarily through grocery and other
retail stores.  Financial information for the last three 
fiscal years attributable to the Company's operations is set
forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements, pages 24 
through 37 of the Annual Report, incorporated herein by 
this reference. 

Unless otherwise stated, all share numbers and stock 
prices in this Form 10-K give effect to the 2:1 stock split
declared July 15, 1997, effected in the form of a stock 
dividend payable September 2, 1997 on all shares of Common 
Stock outstanding as of the close of business on July 28, 
1997.

(c)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS.  Products currently marketed in the 
United States and certain foreign countries are listed on 
the inside back cover (page 44) of the Annual Report, 
incorporated herein by this reference.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS - METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION.  Most non-
durable household consumer products are nationally 
advertised and sold within the United States to grocery 
stores through a network of brokers, and to mass 
merchandisers, warehouse clubs, military and other retail 
stores primarily through a direct sales force.  The Company
also sells, within the United States, institutional versions
of specialty food and non-food products.  Outside the 
United States, the Company sells consumer products through 
subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and joint venture 
arrangements with local partners.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.  The Company has
obtained ample supplies of all required raw materials and 
packaging supplies, which, with a few exceptions, were 
available from a wide variety of sources during fiscal 
year 1997.  Contingency plans have been developed for 
single sourced supplier materials. 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS.  Although some products are 
covered by patents, the Company does not believe that 
patents, patent licenses or similar arrangements are 
material to its business.  Most of the Company's brand 
name consumer products are protected by registered 
trademarks.  Its brand names and trademarks are extremely 
important to its business and the Company pursues a course 
of vigorous action against apparent infringements.

SEASONALITY.  The only portions of the operations of the 
Company which have any significant degree of seasonality 
are the marketing of charcoal briquets, insecticides, and 
automotive appearance products.  Most sales of these 
product lines occur in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Working capital to carry inventories built up in the off-
season and to extend terms to customers is generally 
provided by internally generated funds plus commercial 
paper lines of credit.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG.  During fiscal years 1995, 
1996 and 1997, revenues from the Company's sales of its 
products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliated 
companies were 13%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of the 
Company's gross consolidated revenues.  Except for this 
relationship, the Company is not dependent upon any other 
single customer or a few customers.  Order backlog is not 
a significant factor in the Company's business.  

RENEGOTIATION.  None of the Company's operations is subject
to renegotiation or termination at the election of the 
Federal government.

COMPETITION.  The markets for consumer products are highly 
competitive and most of the Company's products compete with
other nationally advertised brands within each category, 
and with "private label" brands and "generic" non-branded 
products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives.  
Competition is encountered from similar and alternative 
products, many of which are produced and marketed by major 
national concerns having financial resources greater than 
those of the Company.  Depending on the competitor, the 
Company's products compete with competitive products on 
price, quality or other benefits to consumers.

A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or 
newly developed) usually encounters intense competition 
requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and 
sales promotion.  If a product gains consumer acceptance, 
it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional
support to maintain relative market position.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  The Company's operations 
incurred expenses of approximately $50,489,000 in fiscal 
year 1997, $45,821,000 in fiscal year 1996 and  
$44,819,000 in fiscal year 1995 on research activities 
relating to the development of new products or the
maintenance and improvement of existing products.  None of 
such research activity was customer sponsored.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  Historically, the Company has not 
made material capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities or to comply with environmental laws and 
regulations.  However, in general, the Company does 
anticipate spending increasing amounts annually for 
facility upgrades and for environmental programs.  The 
amount of capital expenditures for environmental compliance
was not material in fiscal year 1997 and is not expected to
be material in the next fiscal year.

In addition, the Company is involved in certain other 
environmental matters, including: 

(i)     The Company sold its architectural coatings business
        in fiscal year 1990.  In connection with the 
        disposition of those manufacturing facilities, the 
        Company retained responsibility for certain 
        environmental obligations.  The financial reserve 
        established at the time of the sale is expected to 
        be adequate to cover the financial responsibilities
        for environmental matters which may arise in the 
        future.

(ii)    The Company was named as a potentially responsible 
        party ("PRP") by the Environmental Protection 
        Agency pursuant to the Spill Compensation and 
        Control Act, the Sanitary Landfill Closure and 
        Contingency Fund Act, and a section of the Solid 
        Waste Management Act, for a site in New Jersey.  
        Based on the Company's experience and because the 
        Company's level of involvement is extremely 
        limited, the Company does not expect that this 
        matter will represent a material cost to the Company
        in the future.

(iii)   The Company continues to operate a water treatment 
        operation at its former Oakland, California 
        manufacturing location.  A financial reserve 
        established in an earlier year is considered by 
        management to be adequate to cover the future costs 
        or liability in connection with this manufacturing
        location.

(iv)    An explosion attributed to methane caused property 
        damage and personal injury in a residential area 
        near a site formerly operated by a subsidiary of 
        the Company in Kingsford, Michigan.  The Company 
        was named as a PRP and jointly with other PRPs and 
        the Environmental Protection Agency is investigating
        the site.  The investigation is ongoing and the 
        Company's potential liability is not expected to be 
        material in the future.

(v)     The Company was named as a PRP by the State of 
        Wisconsin for a site in Rice Lake, Wisconsin in 
        connection with  the Company's former frozen foods 
        business.  Based on the Company's experience and 
        because the Company's level of involvement was 
        limited, the Company does not expect that this 
        matter will represent a material cost to the 
        Company in the future.

(vi)    The Company was named as a PRP by the Environmental 
        Protection Agency for a landfill site in Whittier, 
        California.  Based on the Company's experience and 
        because the Company's level of involvement was 
        extremely limited, the Company does not expect that 
        this matter will represent a material cost to the 
        Company in the future.
  
(vii)   The Company was served with a Notice of Violation 
        by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to 
        the Clean Air Act for a site operated by its 
        subsidiary in Beryl, West Virginia.   Based on the 
        Company's experience, the Company does not expect 
        that this matter will represent a material cost to 
        the Company in the future. 

(viii)  The Company was served with a Notice of Violation 
        by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to 
        the Clean Air Act for a site in Chicago, Illinois. 
        Based on the Company 's experience, the Company 
        does not expect that this matter will represent a
        material cost to the Company in the future.

Although the potential cost to the Company related to 
ongoing environmental matters is uncertain due to such 
factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and 
clean-up costs; the complexity and evolving nature of 
governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations;
and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of 
alternative clean-up technologies; based on its experience 
and without offsetting for expected insurance recoveries or
discounting for present value, the Company does not expect 
that such costs individually and in the aggregate will 
represent a material cost to the Company or affect its 
competitive position.

NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED.  At the end of fiscal year 1997,
approximately 5,500 persons were employed by the Company.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS.  This Form 10-K
contains "forward-looking" statements under applicable 
securities laws.  In addition, from time to time, the 
Company may publish forward-looking statements relating to 
such matters as anticipated financial performance, business 
prospects, new products, research and development 
activities, plans for international expansion, and similar 
matters.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. 
In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the 
Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the 
Company's actual results and experience to differ materially
from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed
in the Company's forward-looking statements.  The risks and 
uncertainties that may affect operations, performance, 
product development, and results of the Company's business 
include those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K and 
the following:

Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results and Stock Price.
Although the Company's recent historical operating results 
have improved when compared with the same quarter in the 
previous fiscal year, there can be no assurance that such 
quarter-to-quarter comparisons will continue to improve, 
or that if any improvement is shown, the degree of 
improvement will meet investors' expectations.  In addition,
sales volume growth, whether due to acquisitions or to 
internal growth, can place burdens on the Company's 
management resources and financial controls which, in turn,
can  have a negative impact on operating results.  The 
Company's quarterly operating results will be influenced by 
a host of factors which include the following: the 
seasonality of its brands; the extent of competition; the 
degree of market acceptance of new products and line 
extensions; the mix of products sold in a given quarter; 
changes in pricing policies by the Company and by its 
competitors; acquisition costs and restructuring and other 
charges associated with acquisitions; the ability of the 
Company to develop, introduce, and market successful new 
products and line extensions; the ability of the Company 
to control its internal costs and the costs of its raw 
materials and packaging materials; the Company's success 
in expanding its international operations; changes in the 
Company's strategy; personnel changes; and general economic
conditions.  To a certain extent, the Company bases its 
expense levels in anticipation of future revenues.  If 
revenue levels come in below such expectations, operating 
results are likely to be adversely affected.  Because of 
all of these factors, the Company believes that quarter-to-
quarter comparisons of its results of operations should not
be relied upon as indications of future performance.  

Future announcements concerning the Company or its 
competitors, quarterly variations in operating results, 
the introduction of new products and line extensions or 
changes in product pricing policies by the Company or its 
competitors, changes in earning estimates by analysts, or 
changes in accounting policies, among other factors, could 
cause the market price of the Company's common stock to 
fluctuate substantially and have an adverse effect on the 
price of the Company's common stock.  In addition, stock 
markets have experienced price and volume volatility and 
such volatility in the future could have an adverse impact 
on the Company's market price.

International Operations. The Company believes that its 
international sales including exports, which were 16% of 
net sales in fiscal year 1997, are likely to comprise an 
increasing percentage of its total sales.  As a result, 
the Company will be increasingly subject to the risks 
associated with foreign operations including economic or 
political instability in its overseas markets, shipping 
delays and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
that may make its products more expensive in its foreign 
markets, all of which could have a significant impact on 
the Company's ability to sell its products on a timely 
and competitive basis in foreign markets and may have a 
materially adverse effect on the Company's results of 
operations or financial position.  The Company seeks to 
limit foreign currency exchange risks through the use of 
foreign currency forward contracts when practical, but 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be 
successful.  In addition, the Company's international 
operations are subject to the risk of new and different 
legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, 
potential difficulties in staffing and managing local 
operations, credit risk of local customers and 
distributors, and potentially adverse tax consequences.

Importance of New Products and Line Extensions.  In most 
categories in which the Company competes, there are 
frequent introductions of new products and line extensions.
Accordingly, an important factor in the Company's future 
performance will be its ability to identify emerging 
consumer and technological trends and to maintain and 
improve the competitiveness of its products.  However, 
there can be no assurance that the Company will 
successfully achieve those goals.  Continued product 
development and marketing efforts are subject to all the 
risks inherent in the development of new products and line 
extensions, including development delays, the failure of 
new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated 
levels of market acceptance, as well as the cost of failed 
product introductions.

Integration of Acquisitions.  One of the Company's 
strategies is to increase its revenues and the markets it 
serves through the acquisition of other businesses both in 
the United States and overseas.  There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, or 
profitably manage additional companies or operations or 
successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into 
its operations.  In addition, there can be no assurance 
that companies or operations acquired will be profitable 
at the time of their acquisition or will achieve sales 
levels and  profitability that justify the investment made. 

Environmental Matters.  The Company is subject to various 
environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in 
which it operates, including those relating to air 
emissions, water discharges, the handling and disposal of 
solid and hazardous wastes, and the remediation of 
contamination associated with the use and disposal of 
hazardous substances.  The Company has incurred, and will 
continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and 
other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in 
both the United States and abroad.  The Company is 
currently involved in or has potential liability with 
respect to the remediation of past contamination in the 
operation of certain of its present and formerly owned and 
leased facilities.  In addition, certain of the Company's 
present and former facilities have been or had been in 
operation for many years, and over such time, some of 
these facilities may have used substances or generated and 
disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous.  
It is possible that such sites, as well as disposal sites 
owned by third parties to which the Company has sent waste, 
may in the future be identified and become the subject of 
remediation.  Accordingly, although the Company believes 
that it is currently in substantial compliance with 
applicable environmental requirements, it is possible the 
Company could become subject to additional environmental 
liabilities in the future which could result in a material
adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or 
financial condition.

Intellectual Property.  The Company relies on trademark, 
trade secret, patent, and copyright law to protect its 
intellectual property.  There can be no assurance that 
such intellectual property rights can be successfully 
asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, 
circumvented, or challenged.  In addition, laws of certain 
foreign countries in which the Company's products are or 
may be sold do not protect the Company's intellectual 
property rights to the same extent as the laws of the 
United States.  The failure of the Company to protect its 
proprietary information and any successful intellectual 
property challenges or infringement proceedings against 
the Company could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's business, operating results, and financial 
condition.

Government Regulation.  The manufacture, packaging, 
storage, distribution, and labeling of the Company's 
products are all subject to extensive federal, state, and 
foreign laws and regulations.  For example, in the United 
States, many of the Company's products are subject to 
regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food 
and Drug Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission.  Most states have agencies which regulate in 
parallel to these federal agencies.  The failure to comply 
with applicable laws and regulations could subject the 
Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, 
recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal 
sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company.  Loss of or failure to obtain 
necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent 
the Company from introducing  new products, building new 
facilities, or acquiring new businesses and could 
adversely effect operating results.

(d)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC 
     OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES.

Net sales, pretax earnings and identifiable assets 
related to foreign operations and export sales are 16%, 
8% and 27%, respectively, for fiscal year 1997.  See Note 
17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, page 35 
of the Annual Report, incorporated herein by this reference.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

PRODUCTION FACILITIES.  The Company operates production and 
major warehouse facilities for its operations in 17 
locations throughout the United States, and in 24 locations
internationally.  Most of the space is owned.  Some space, 
mainly for warehousing, is leased.  No facilities were 
either closed or sold during fiscal year 1997.  The Company 
considers its manufacturing and warehousing facilities to be
adequate to support its business.

OFFICES AND TECHNICAL CENTER.  The Company's general 
office building is owned and is located in Oakland, 
California.  The Company's Technical Center and Data 
Center are owned and are located in Pleasanton, California.
Leased sales and other office facilities are located at a 
number of manufacturing and other locations.

ENCUMBRANCES.  None of the Company's owned facilities are 
encumbered to secure debt owed by the Company, except that 
the manufacturing facilities in Wheeling, Illinois and 
Belle, Missouri secure industrial revenue bond indebtedness
incurred in relation to the construction or upgrade thereof.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

None.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

None.
