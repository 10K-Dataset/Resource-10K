ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006



PART I

This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Report), including the exhibits hereto and the information
incorporated by reference herein, contains “forward looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and such forward looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,”
“goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations on such
words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements are only predictions, subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual
results could differ materially from those discussed in this Report. These risks and uncertainties
include those discussed below under “Risk Factors,” as updated from time to time in the Company’s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors include, but are not
limited to, general economic and marketplace conditions and events; competitors’ actions; the
Company’s costs, including changes in exposure to commodity costs such as resin, diesel and
chlor-alkali; increases in energy costs; consumer and customer reaction to price increases;
customer-specific ordering patterns and trends; the Company’s actual cost performance; any future
supply constraints that may affect key commodities; risks inherent in sole-supplier relationships;
risks related to customer concentration; risks arising out of natural disasters; risks inherent in
litigation, including the litigation relating to the cumulative charge resulting from additional
stock option compensation expenses relating to prior periods; risks related to international
operations; uncertainties and costs regarding a change in the Company’s chief executive officer;
risks inherent in maintaining an effective system of internal controls; the ability to manage and
realize the benefits of joint ventures and other cooperative relationships, including the Company’s
joint venture with The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) regarding the Company’s Glad

®

plastic bags, wraps and containers business; the success of new products; the integration of
acquisitions and mergers; the divestiture of nonstrategic businesses; the implementation of the
Company’s strategy; and the ability of the Company to successfully manage tax, regulatory, product
liability, intellectual property, environmental and other legal matters, including the risk
resulting from joint and several liability for environmental contingencies. In addition, the
Company’s future performance is subject to risks particular to the share exchange transaction with
Henkel KGaA (Henkel), including the sustainability of cash flows and the actual level of debt
costs. Declines in cash flow, whether resulting from tax payments, debt payments, share
repurchases, interest cost increases greater than management expects, or otherwise, could adversely
affect the Company’s earnings.

The Company’s forward-looking statements in this Report are and will be based on management’s then
current views and assumptions regarding future events and speak only as of their dates. The Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by the federal securities
laws.

In this Report, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “the Company” and “Clorox” refer
to The Clorox Company and its subsidiaries.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

The Company was originally founded in Oakland, Calif. in 1913 as the Electro-Alkaline Company. It
was reincorporated as Clorox Chemical Corporation in 1922, as Clorox Chemical Co. in 1928 and as
The Clorox Company (an Ohio corporation) in 1957, when the business was acquired by P&G. The
Company was fully divested by P&G in 1969 and, as an independent company, was reincorporated in
1973 in California as The Clorox Company. In 1986, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. In
January 1999, the Company acquired First Brands Corporation.

In November 2004, the Company completed the exchange of its ownership interest in a subsidiary for
approximately 61.4 million shares of its common stock held by Henkel, which represented
approximately 29% of the Company’s outstanding common stock prior to the exchange. The parties
agreed that the Company would provide exchange value equal to $46.25 per share of Company common
stock being acquired in the exchange. The subsidiary transferred to Henkel contained the Company’s
existing insecticides and Soft Scrub

®

cleaner businesses, its 20% interest in the Henkel
Iberica, S.A. joint venture and approximately $2.1 billion in cash. For further information on
recent business developments, refer to the information set forth under the caption “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis,” on pages 1 through 18 of
Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by
reference.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS – METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION.

Most of the Company’s nondurable household consumer
products are nationally advertised and sold within the United States to mass merchandisers,
warehouse clubs and dollar, military and other retail stores primarily through a direct sales
force, and to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers primarily through a network of brokers. Within
the United States, the Company also sells institutional versions of many of its products. Outside
the United States, the Company sells consumer products to the retail trade through subsidiaries,
licensees, distributors and joint-venture arrangements with local partners.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.

The Company purchases raw materials, packaging supplies
and energy from numerous unaffiliated firms, some of which are sole suppliers. Interruptions in the
delivery of these materials or services could adversely impact the Company. Significant raw
materials were available from a sufficient number of sources during fiscal year 2006, although
costs were significantly higher than prior-year levels. The Company utilizes supply and
forward-purchase contracts to ensure availability of raw material supply at the quantity and
quality standards needed in its operations. The Company is exposed to changes in the price of
commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products. For further information
regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
about Market Risk” in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis” on pages 13 through 14 of Exhibit
99.1 hereto and “Risk Factors – Price increases in raw materials could harm the Company’s profits”
in Item 1.A.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS.

Most of the Company’s brand name consumer products are protected by
registered trademarks. Its brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business, and the
Company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements. Maintenance of brand
equity value is critical to the Company’s success. The Company’s patent rights are also material to
its business and are asserted, where appropriate, against apparent infringements.

SEASONALITY.

Most sales of the Company’s charcoal briquets and foods product lines occur in the
first six months of each calendar year. Operating cash flow is used to build inventories of those
products in the off-season.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG.

During fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, net sales to the Company’s
largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its domestic and international affiliates, were 26%,
26% and 25%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Order backlog is not a
significant factor in the Company’s business.

COMPETITION.

The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. Most of the Company’s
products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private
label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in
certain categories. Competition is encountered from similar and alternative products, some of which
are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources
greater than those of the Company. Depending on the product, the Company’s products compete on
product performance, brand recognition, price, quality or other benefits to consumers. A newly
introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense
competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade
merchandising support. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued
advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

The Company conducts research and development primarily at its Technical
Center in Pleasanton, Calif. The Company devotes significant resources and attention to product
development, process technology and researching consumer insights to develop consumer-preferred
products with innovative and distinctive features. The Company incurred expenses of $99 million,
$88 million and $84 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, on direct research
activities relating to the development of new products or the maintenance and improvement of
existing products. None of this research activity was customer-sponsored.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

In general, the Company anticipates spending increasing amounts annually for
facility upgrades and for environmental programs as existing facilities age. The amount of capital
expenditures for



environmental compliance was approximately $2 million in fiscal year 2006 and is not expected to be
material in the next fiscal year. For non capital expenditures, see the discussions below under
“Risk Factors – Environmental matters create potential liability
risks” in Item 1.A. and “Legal
Proceedings” in Item 3.

NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED.

At the end of fiscal year 2006, the Company employed approximately
7,600 people.

ITEM 1.A. RISK FACTORS

The following risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Report
or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Company’s business,
financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not
presently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may
also harm the Company’s business operations and financial results.

Operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations.

The Company cannot be certain that its operating results and net earnings will meet its
expectations. If the Company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition,
or if the Company does not achieve all of its key goals, then its actual performance could vary
materially from its expectations. The Company’s operating results and net earnings may be
influenced by a number of factors, including the following:



In addition, sales volume growth, whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth, can place
burdens on management resources and financial controls that, in turn, can have a negative impact on
operating results and net earnings. To some extent, the Company sets its expense levels in
anticipation of future revenues. If actual revenue falls short of these expectations, operating
results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected.

The Company faces intense competition in its markets.

The Company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the U.S. and in its
international markets. Most of the Company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands
within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of
grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories, which typically are sold at lower
prices. The Company also encounters competition from similar and alternative products, many of
which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies.



The Company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition,
price, quality or other benefits to consumers. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging
also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions.

A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters
intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade
merchandising. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising
and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. Some of the Company’s competitors
are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the Company. These competitors may be
able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing
products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions
than the Company can. In addition, the Company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by
offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the Company. Competitive pricing
may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions or reduce prices and
could lead to a reduction in its sales or its profits.

Volume growth may be difficult to achieve.

A large percentage of the Company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to
increased competition. During fiscal year 2006, approximately 84% of the Company’s net sales were
generated in U.S. markets. U.S. markets for household products are considered mature and are
generally characterized by high household penetration. The Company’s ability to achieve volume
growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation and investment in its
established brands and its ability to capture market share from competitors. During fiscal year
2006, the Company increased prices on more than 50% of its product portfolio. Price increases may
slow volume growth or create declines in volume in the short term as consumers adjust to price
increases. If the Company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines, or bring
innovation to grow its product categories, or develop, acquire or successfully launch new products,
it may not achieve its volume growth objectives.

The growth of the Company’s business depends on continuous and successful new product introductions.

In most categories in which the Company competes, there are frequent introductions of new products
and line extensions. Important factors in the Company’s future performance will be its ability to
identify emerging consumer and technological trends and maintain and improve the competitiveness of
its product offerings. The Company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals.
The development and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research,
development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new
products do not gain widespread market acceptance. New product development and marketing efforts
have inherent risks, including product development or launch delays, which could result in the
Company not being first to market, the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve
anticipated levels of market acceptance, and the cost of failed product introductions.

The Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales.

A limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Company’s net sales. The
Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its domestic and international affiliated
companies, accounted for approximately 26% of the Company’s net sales during fiscal years 2006 and
2005 and 25% of net sales in fiscal year 2004. During fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company’s five largest customers accounted for 41%, 40% and 40% of its net sales, respectively. The
Company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small
number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers
continues. As a result, changes in the strategies of the Company’s largest customers, including a
reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private-label or
competitors’ products, may harm the Company’s sales. In addition, the Company’s business is based
primarily upon individual sales orders, and the Company typically does not enter into long-term
contracts with its customers. Accordingly, these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or
cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. If the Company loses a
significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, it
may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.



Large sophisticated customers may take actions that adversely affect the Company’s margins and results of operations.

In recent years, the Company has experienced a consumer purchasing trend away from traditional
grocers and toward mass merchandisers, which include super centers and dollar and club stores. This
trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of these mass merchandisers, who may demand
lower pricing or special packaging, or impose other requirements on product suppliers. These
business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the
customer-supplier relationship. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of these
mass merchandisers, they could decrease their purchases from the Company, causing the Company’s
sales and profitability to decline.

Price increases in raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the Company’s profits.

Increases in the cost of raw materials including resin, chlor-alkali, linerboard, soy bean oil,
solvent and other miscellaneous chemicals, or increases in the cost of energy, transportation and
other necessary services, may harm the Company’s profits and operating results. In particular,
during fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the Company experienced unprecedented levels of price increases
for certain of its raw materials and diesel fuel and energy costs, primarily as a result of supply
interruptions caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita and strong demand from abroad. If price
increases in any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the
Company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset the
increase in prices, its profits and operating results may be harmed. In addition, in some cases,
the Company relies on a limited number of suppliers or sole suppliers for its raw materials or
other necessary supplies. If the Company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relations
or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels need for its
business, it could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be
adversely affected. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices,
see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis” on pages 13 through 14 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.

Operations outside the United States expose the Company to uncertain conditions and other risks in
international markets.

The Company’s sales outside the United States were approximately 16% of net sales in fiscal year
2006, and the Company owns and operates 21 manufacturing facilities outside the United States. The
Company has and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations,
including:

•

economic or political instability in its international markets, particularly Colombia and Venezuela.

•

restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States; and

•

the imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions.

These risks could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to sell its products on a
competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations or financial position. The Company’s small volume in some countries, relative to some
multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.

Also, the Company’s operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new and
different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in
staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption, credit
risk of local customers and distributors, and potentially adverse tax consequences.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales,
profits and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although
the Company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, it is not fully protected
against foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings will be affected by changes in
foreign exchange rates.



The share exchange with Henkel could result in significant tax liability.

On November 22, 2004, the Company completed the exchange of its ownership interest in a subsidiary
for Henkel’s approximately 61.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock, which represented
approximately 29% of the Company’s common stock prior to the exchange. At the time of the share
exchange with Henkel, the Company received an opinion from its special tax counsel to the effect
that, among other things, the share exchange should qualify as a tax-free distribution under
Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and that the Company should recognize no
gain or loss upon the distribution of its subsidiary’s stock to Henkel for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In addition, at the time of the share exchange, Henkel received an opinion from its
special tax counsel to the effect that, among other things, the share exchange of the subsidiary’s
stock to Henkel should qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. These opinions were based in part upon various factual representations
that Henkel and the Company made. The Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
cause such representations to be untrue or incomplete in any material respect. Nonetheless, the
Company cannot be certain that the share exchange will qualify for tax-free treatment to it or to
Henkel. The Company did not apply for an advance tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the share exchange. Opinions of
counsel are not binding on the IRS, and the conclusions expressed in the opinions could be
challenged by the IRS.

In general, the Company agreed to be responsible for Henkel’s taxes on the transaction if the
Company’s actions result in a breach of the representations and warranties in a manner that causes
the share exchange to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment. Henkel agreed to similar obligations.
It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to Henkel and to the Company would be substantial.
Although certain of the taxes described above would be imposed on Henkel, the Company would, in
certain circumstances, be liable for all or a portion of such taxes. See “Risk Factors–If the share
exchange with Henkel is treated as a taxable transaction, and the Company is required to indemnify
Henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement, it could materially
affect the Company’s liquidity.”

Even if the share exchange is tax-free to Henkel under Section 355 of the Code, it could be taxable
to the Company if Section 355(e) of the Code applies to the share exchange. Section 355(e) of the
Code will apply if 50% or more of the Company’s stock or its former subsidiary’s stock, by vote or
value, is acquired by one or more persons, acting pursuant to a plan or a series of related
transactions that includes the share exchange. The Company cannot be certain that Section 355(e) of
the Code will not apply to the share exchange. Risk of the applicability of Section 355(e) of the
Code may also discourage, delay or prevent a merger, change of control, or other strategic or
capital raising transaction involving the Company’s outstanding equity or issuance of new equity.

If the share exchange with Henkel is treated as a taxable transaction, and the Company is required
to indemnify Henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement, it could
materially affect the Company’s liquidity.

In general, pursuant to the tax matters agreement that the Company entered into with Henkel in
connection with the share exchange, the Company agreed to be responsible for any taxes, including
the taxes of Henkel, that result from certain of the Company’s actions or that result from the
Company’s breach of a representation or a covenant that it has given in connection with the tax
opinion delivered to the Company by its special tax counsel and the tax opinion delivered to Henkel
by its special tax counsel, described above, in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code or from the application of Section
355(e) of the Code. Henkel has agreed to similar obligations in the tax matters agreement. The
Company’s indemnification obligations to Henkel are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If
the Company is required to indemnify Henkel under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters
agreement, it may be subject to substantial liabilities that may materially affect its liquidity
and, therefore, its ability to service the senior notes it issued in connection with the share
exchange.

Resolutions of tax disputes may impact the Company’s earnings and cash flow.

Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating
its tax positions. The Company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the
belief that its tax return positions are fully supported, it believes that certain positions will
be challenged and that its positions may not be fully sustained. The tax-contingency accruals are
adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law
development and emerging legislation. The Company’s effective tax rate includes the



impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals, including related interest and
penalties, as considered appropriate by management. When particular matters arise, a number of
years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such
matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company’s effective tax rate in the year of
resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate.
Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.

The IRS has completed audits of the Company’s income tax returns through the fiscal year ended June
30, 2002. In April 2005, the Company announced an agreement with the IRS resolving certain tax
issues arising in the period from 1997 through 2000. As a result, the Company paid federal and
state taxes and interest of $94 million and $151 million during fiscal years 2005 and 2006,
respectively. These payments negatively impacted the Company’s cash flows. The Company had
previously accrued for this contingency and released tax-contingency accruals associated with this
settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. Additional tax matters through fiscal year
2002 are now being reviewed at the IRS Appeals level. Resolution of these matters is not expected
to have a material impact on earnings or cash flow. For additional information, refer to the
information set forth under the caption “Contingencies” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,”
beginning on page 12 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.

Identification of good acquisition candidates or joint-venture partners may be difficult and
integration and management of acquisitions may not be successful.

One of the elements of the Company’s growth plan is to look at the possibility of increasing its
sales, volumes, earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of, or joint ventures with,
other businesses in the United States and international markets. Not only is the identification of
good acquisition or joint-venture candidates difficult and competitive, but these transactions also
involve numerous risks, including the following:

•

difficulties in integrating the acquired companies, products or personnel into the
Company’s existing business;

•

difficulties in retaining key relationships with employees, customers, partners and
suppliers of the acquired company; and

•

difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies
throughout acquired companies.

In addition, companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or
may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Future
acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the
incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain
intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that the economic
benefits associated with any of the Company’s acquisitions diminish in the future, the Company may
be required to record additional write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets or other assets
associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect its operating results.

Government regulations could impose material costs.

Generally, the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and advertising of the
Company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive
federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the United States, many of the
Company’s products are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug
Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Company’s product claims and
advertising are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. Most states have agencies that regulate
in parallel to these federal agencies. In addition, the Company’s international operations are
subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes
its products. During the past two years, the Company experienced an increase in the number of
regulatory inspections at its facilities in the U.S. If the Company is found to be out of
compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to
civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential
criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Loss of or
failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the Company from
meeting current product demand, introducing new products,



building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results,
particularly with respect to its charcoal business. It is possible that the federal government will
increase regulation of the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland
security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact supplies of
raw material or costs.

Product liability claims could adversely affect the Company’s sales and operating results.

The Company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products.
Claims could be based on allegations that, among other things, the Company’s products contain
contaminants, provide inadequate instructions regarding their use, or inadequate warnings
concerning interactions with other substances. Product liability claims could result in negative
publicity that could harm the Company’s sales and operating results. In addition, if one of the
Company’s products is found to be defective, the Company could be required to recall it, which
could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product
liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance
coverage or potential product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy.

Environmental matters create potential liability risks.

The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions
in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, the handling and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use
and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company is currently involved in or has potential
liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its
currently and formerly owned and leased facilities. In addition, some of its present and former
facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of these
facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be
considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third
parties to which the Company has sent waste, may in the future be identified and become the subject
of remediation. It is possible that the Company could become subject to additional environmental
liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of
operations or financial condition.

At June 30, 2006, the Company had a recorded liability of $27 million for its future
remediation costs. One matter in Dickinson County, Michigan, for which the Company is jointly and
severally liable, accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability. The Company is
subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with another party for this matter, and the Company has
agreed to be liable for 24.3% of the aggregate remediation and associated costs, other than legal
fees, as it and the other party are each responsible for their own such fees. If the other party
with whom the Company shares joint and several liability is unable to pay its share of the response
and remediation obligations, the Company would likely be responsible for such obligations. In
October 2004, the Company and the other party agreed to a consent judgment with the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality, which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring
activities. Based on the current status of this matter, and with the assistance of environmental
consultants, the Company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its
share of costs associated with the capital expenditures, maintenance and other costs to be incurred
over an estimated 30-year remediation period. The most significant components of the liability
relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and
excess levels of subterranean methane deposits. Currently, the Company cannot accurately predict
the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation. In addition,
the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors, including the efficacy
of remediation efforts, changes in remediation requirements and the timing, varying costs and
alternative clean-up technologies that may become available in the future. Although it is possible
that the Company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded, any amount of such additional
exposures, or range of exposures, is not estimable at this time.

The Company also handles and/or transports hazardous substances, including but not limited to
chlorine, at its plant sites, including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of
origin to our manufacturing facilities. A release of such chemicals, whether in transit or at our
facilities, due to accident or an intentional act, could result in substantial liability. The
Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other
costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for
its worldwide operations.



Failure to maximize or to successfully assert the Company’s intellectual property rights could
impact its competitiveness.

The Company relies on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its
intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights
will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will
not be able to obtain and perfect its own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property
rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be certain that these
rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and the
Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to defend its intellectual
property rights. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of
some of the other countries in which the Company’s products are or may be sold do not protect
intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties
infringe the Company’s intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of its brands in the
marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Company’s brands and
harm its sales. The failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights
could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business,
operating results and financial condition.

If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others it could
impact its competitiveness.

It is possible that the Company will be found to have violated the trademark, trade secret,
copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others. Such a finding could result in
the need to cease use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the
Company’s business and to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. It could also be
necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holder is willing to permit the
Company to continue to use the intellectual property rights. Either having to cease use or pay such
amounts could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its
business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results
and prevent the Company from fulfilling its obligations.

The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness. As of June 30, 2006, the Company had $2.0
billion of long-term debt.

The Company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

To service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends, the Company will require a significant amount
of cash. The Company’s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control. In
addition, to pay cash dividends, the Company must have net profits as defined by Delaware law.

The Company’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness and to fund planned
capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend on its ability to generate cash in the
future. In addition, the Company’s ability to pay cash dividends will depend on its ability to
generate cash and net profits. The ability to



generate cash and net profits, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.

The Company may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the
risks described above.

The Company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. As of June 30,
2006, approximately $1.3 billion was available to borrow under the Company’s $1.3 billion revolving
credit facility. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that the
Company now faces could intensify.

The Company may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.

Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled
personnel, including members of the executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff
positions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company announced that Gerald E.
Johnston, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was retiring from his positions and that the
Board of Directors, with the assistance of an executive search firm, would conduct an internal and
external search for a new Chief Executive Officer. Experienced personnel, including executives, in
the Company’s industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense, especially
in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Company’s corporate headquarters and many of its employees
are located. Although the Company strives to be an employer of choice, it may not be able to
successfully attract and retain key personnel, which would cause its business to suffer.

The Company’s manufacturing and other facilities may be subject to disruption from work stoppages,
terrorism or natural disasters.

Operations at the Company’s manufacturing facilities may be subject to disruption for a variety of
reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or
other natural disasters. In addition, the Company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are
located near major earthquake fault lines in California. If a major disruption were to occur, it
could result in temporary loss of access to critical data, delays in shipments of products to
customers, suspension of operations, or harm to people or the natural environment.

The Company may be liable for unauthorized disclosure of data.

In connection with some of the Company’s customer loyalty programs and promotional programs, it
gathers and stores limited personal data regarding the consumers of its products. These programs
typically provide that the Company enter into contracts, which specify limits on use of this data.
If any person, including any of the Company’s employees or partners, circumvents the Company’s
security measures, they could misappropriate this data. If this occurs, the Company could be
subject to liability as a result of the security breach or misappropriation of its registered
consumers’ personal data.

Failure to meet market expectations could impact the Company’s stock price.

The market price for the Company’s stock is based, in part, on market expectations for the
Company’s sales growth, earning per share and cash flow. Failure to meet these expectations could
cause the market price of the Company’s stock to decline, potentially rapidly and sharply.

The Company’s continued growth and expansion could adversely affect its internal control over
financial reporting, which could harm its business and financial results.

The management of Clorox is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control
over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the Company’s transactions, providing reasonable assurance that receipts and
expenditures are made in accordance with management’s authorization, and providing reasonable
assurance that the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not
intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Company’s financial



statements would be prevented or detected. The Company’s continuing growth and expansion in
domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the Company’s
system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of
internal control over financial reporting could limit the Company’s ability to report its financial
results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.

ITEM 1.B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

The Company owns and operates 23 manufacturing facilities
in the United States, 11 of which serve primarily the Household Group–North America segment and
12 of which serve primarily the Specialty Group segment. The Company owns and operates 21
manufacturing facilities internationally, which serve primarily the International segment. The
Company also leases six regional distribution centers in the United States, which serve primarily
the Household Group–North America and Specialty Group segments, and leases and operates one
regional distribution center in Canada. Management believes that the Company’s production and
distribution facilities, together with additional facilities owned or leased and operated by
various unaffiliated finished product suppliers and distribution center service providers that
serve the Company, are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the Company’s
properties and equipment have generally been well maintained.

OFFICES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES.

The Company owns its general office building
located in Oakland, Calif. The Company also owns its Technical Center and Data Center located in
Pleasanton, California. The Company leases its research and development center and its engineering
research facilities, which are located in Willowbrook, Ill., Cincinnati, Oh. and Kennesaw, Ga.,
respectively. The Company owns a research and development facility at its plant in Aldo Bonzi,
Argentina. Leased sales and other facilities are located at a number of other locations.

ENCUMBRANCES

. None of the Company’s owned facilities are encumbered to secure debt owed by the
Company.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On
August 4, 2006, a derivative action purportedly on behalf of the
Company was filed in
the Superior Court of Calif., Alameda County, against certain current and former directors and
officers of the Company. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges, among other things, breach of
fiduciary duties and waste of corporate assets. These allegations relate to the noncash
compensation expense the Company recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, following
a review of its stock option practices.
The complaint demands,
among other forms of relief, judgment in the form of monetary damages sustained by the Company as a
result of such practices.

While there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of this action, the Company does not
believe that its resolution will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the interim chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosure.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management’s
