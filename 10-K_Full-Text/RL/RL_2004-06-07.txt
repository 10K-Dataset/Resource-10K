PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

In this Form 10-K, references to
“Polo,” “ourselves,” “we,”
“our,” and “us” refer to Polo Ralph Lauren
Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires
otherwise. Due to the collaborative and ongoing nature of our
relationships with our licensees, such licensees are referred to
in this Form 10-K as “licensing partners” and the
relationships between Polo and these licensees are referred to
as “licensing alliances.” However, the legal
relationship between ourselves and our licensees is not one of
partnership, but of licensor and licensee. Our fiscal year ends
on the Saturday nearest to March 31. All references to
“Fiscal 2004” represent the 53-week fiscal year ended
April 3, 2004, while references to “Fiscal 2003”
and “Fiscal 2002” represent the 52-week fiscal years
ended March 29, 2003 and March 30, 2002, respectively.

We are a leader in the design, marketing and
distribution of premium lifestyle products. For more than
35 years, our reputation and distinctive image have been
consistently developed across an expanding number of products,
brands and international markets. Our brand names, which include
“Polo,” “Polo by Ralph Lauren,” “Ralph
Lauren Purple Label,” “Polo Sport,” “Ralph
Lauren,” “ Blue Label,” “Lauren,”
“Polo Jeans,” “RL,” “Chaps” and
“Club Monaco,” among others, constitute one of the
world’s most widely recognized families of consumer brands.
We believe that, under the direction of Ralph Lauren, the
internationally renowned designer, we have influenced the manner
in which people dress and live in contemporary society,
reflecting an American perspective and lifestyle uniquely
associated with Polo and Ralph Lauren.

We combine our consumer insight and design,
marketing and imaging skills to offer, along with our licensing
partners, broad lifestyle product collections in four categories:

Recent Developments

On May 25, 2004, the Company entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire certain of the assets and to
assume certain of the liabilities of RL Childrenswear Company,
LLC, relating to the Childrenswear Licensee’s licensed
childrenswear apparel business in the United States, Canada and
Mexico (the “Childrenswear Business”). The purchase
price for the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business will be
$232.1 million in cash payable at closing, subject to a
working capital adjustment, plus up to an additional
$20 million of deferred and contingent cash payments.
Payment of the purchase price will be funded by cash on hand and
lines of credit as required. In addition, the Company will
assume certain ordinary course trade payables and accrued
expenses of the Childrenswear Licensee and accrued vacation
obligations for the Childrenswear Licensee’s employees who
will become employees of the Company following the closing of
the acquisition. The assets of the Childrenswear Licensee being
acquired by the Company include, among other things, the
license; all inventories of the Childrenswear Licensee; certain
leases; customer lists; supplier lists; and books and records.

The Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its
affiliates and shareholders have agreed to indemnify the Company
for all of the liabilities of the Company related to the
operation of the Childrenswear Business prior to the closing of
the acquisition and have also agreed that they will not compete
with the Childrenswear Business for a period of three years
after the closing date. In addition, the Childrenswear Licensee
and certain of its affiliates will provide information system
and accounting services to the Company for a transitional period
following the closing.

The closing of the proposed transaction is
subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of
certain third party consents and the expiration or termination
of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The closing of the
transaction is anticipated to occur in late June 2004.

As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel
Group, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, “Jones”) to
meet the minimum sales volumes for the year ended
December 31, 2002 under the license agreements for the sale
of products under the “Ralph” trademark between us and
Jones dated May 11, 1998, these license agreements
terminated as of December 31, 2003. We advised Jones that
the termination of these license agreements would automatically
result in the termination of the license agreements between us
and Jones with respect to the “Lauren” trademark
pursuant to the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement
between the Company and Jones dated May 11, 1998. The terms
of the Lauren license agreements would otherwise have expired on
December 31, 2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit
against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York
alleging, among other things, that we had breached the Lauren
license agreements by asserting our rights pursuant to the Cross
Default and Term Extension Agreement, and that we induced
Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the former President of Jones, to
breach the non-compete and confidentiality clauses in
Ms. Nemerov’s employment agreement with Jones. Jones
stated that it would treat the Lauren license agreements as
terminated as of December 31, 2003, and is seeking
compensatory damages of $550.0 million, punitive damages
and enforcement of Ms. Nemerov’s agreement. Also on
June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Jones in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking, among other
things, an injunction and a declaratory judgment that the Lauren
license agreements would terminate as of December 31, 2003
pursuant to the terms of the Cross Default and Term Extension
Agreement. The two lawsuits were consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims regarding breach of the
“Lauren” agreements and a motion to stay the claims
regarding Ms. Nemerov pending the arbitration of
Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On July 23,
2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgment in our action
against Jones, and on August 12, 2003, we filed a
cross-motion for summary judgment. Oral argument on the motions
was heard on September 30, 2003. On



March 18, 2004, the Court entered orders
(i) denying our motion to dismiss Jones’ claims
against us for breach of the Lauren agreements and
(ii) granting Jones’ motion for summary judgment in
our action for declaratory judgment that the Lauren agreements
terminated on December 31, 2003 and dismissing our
complaint. The order also stayed Jones’ claim against us
relating to Ms. Nemerov pending arbitration regarding the
alleged breach of her employment agreement. On April 16,
2004, we moved the Court to reconsider its orders, and a hearing
on our motion was held on May 19, 2004. The Court has not
yet issued a ruling as a result of this hearing. We have also
filed notices of appeal of the orders. If Jones’ lawsuit
were to be determined adversely to us, it could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition. However, we intend to continue to defend the case
vigorously and believe our position is correct on the merits.

The royalties that we received pursuant to the
“Lauren” license agreements and “Ralph”
license agreements represented revenues of approximately
$23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively in Fiscal
2004 and $37.4 million and $5.3 million, respectively,
in Fiscal 2003. We no longer receive these royalties as a result
of the termination of the Lauren and Ralph license agreements on
December 31, 2003. Although the loss of the Lauren and
Ralph royalties from Jones and the start up expenses associated
with the Lauren line exceeded the income from our sales of
Lauren products in the fourth quarter in Fiscal 2004, we expect
that the income from our sales of Lauren products will at least
replace the royalty income previously attributable to the Lauren
and Ralph license agreements for Fiscal 2005. In total,
royalties received from Jones, including royalties from the
“Polo Jeans” license agreements, accounted for 17.2%
of our aggregate licensing revenue for Fiscal 2004. The
“Polo Jeans” license agreements were not covered under
the terms of the Cross Default and Term Extension agreement and
continues in effect.

In June 2003, one of our licensing partners,
WestPoint Stevens, Inc., and certain of its affiliates
(“WestPoint”) filed a voluntary petition for
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint produces bedding and bath product in
our home collection, and royalties paid by WestPoint accounted
for 15.9% of our licensing revenues in Fiscal 2003. On
December 19, 2003, the United States Bankruptcy Court
approved an amended licensing agreement between WestPoint and us
which provides for the same royalty rate and minimums that are
not materially less than the previous agreement. As of the end
of the fiscal year, Westpoint’s payment status was
satisfactory.

Operations

We operate in three integrated business segments:
wholesale, retail and licensing. Details of our net revenues by
business segment are shown in the tables below. See also
Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for Fiscal
2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 for further segment
information.



Wholesale

Our wholesale business is divided primarily into
three groups: Polo Brands, Lauren, and Collection Brands. In
each of these wholesale groups, we offer discrete brand
offerings, directed by teams consisting of design,
merchandising, sales and production staff who work together to
conceive, develop and merchandise product groupings organized to
convey a variety of design concepts.

Polo Brands

Our Polo Brands group sources, markets and
distributes products under the following brands:

Polo by Ralph
Lauren.

The Polo by Ralph Lauren
menswear collection is a complete men’s wardrobe consisting
of products related by theme, style, color and fabric. Polo by
Ralph Lauren menswear is generally priced at a range of price
points within the men’s premium ready-to-wear apparel
market. We currently sell this collection through department
stores, specialty stores and Polo Ralph Lauren and outlet stores
in the United States and abroad.

Blue Label.

The Blue Label collection of womenswear reflects a modern
interpretation of classic Ralph Lauren styles with a strong
weekend focus. Blue Label collection is generally priced at a
range of price points within the premium ready-to-wear apparel
market. We currently sell the Blue Label collection domestically
and internationally through Polo Ralph Lauren stores and through
selected wholesale accounts in Europe and Asia. In Japan, our
Blue Label line is sold under the Ralph Lauren brand name.

Polo Golf.

The Polo Golf collection of men’s and women’s golf
apparel is targeted at the golf and resort markets. Price points
are similar to those charged for products in the Polo by Ralph
Lauren line. We sell the Polo Golf collection in the United
States through leading golf clubs, pro shops and resorts, in
addition to department stores, specialty stores and Polo Ralph
Lauren stores.

RLX Polo
Sport.

The RLX Polo Sport
collection of menswear and womenswear consists of functional
sport and outdoor apparel for running, cross-training, skiing,
snowboarding and cycling. We sell RLX Polo Sport in our Polo
Ralph Lauren stores.

Lauren

Lauren Ralph Lauren

women’s collection is a
complete women’s lifestyle brand consisting of products
related by theme, style, color and fabric. Lauren Ralph Lauren
Women’s is generally priced at a range of price points
within the women’s better ready-to-wear apparel market. We
currently sell this collection through department stores within
the United States and Canada.

Collection Brands

Our Collection Brands group sources, markets and
distributes products under the following brands:

Women’s Ralph Lauren Collection and
Black Label.

The Ralph Lauren
Collection expresses our up-to-the-moment fashion vision for
women. Ralph Lauren Black Label includes timeless versions of
our most successful Collection styles as well as newly-designed
classic signature styles. Collection and Black Label are offered
through our own stores and limited distribution to premier
fashion retailers. Price points are at the upper end to luxury
range.

Men’s Purple Label
Collection.

In fall 1995, we
introduced our Purple Label collection of men’s tailored
clothing and, in fall 1997, to complement the tailored clothing
line, we launched our Purple Label sportswear line. We sell the
Purple Label collection through our own stores and a limited
number of premier fashion retailers, at price points at the
upper end to luxury range.



Customers and Service

Consistent with the appeal and distinctive image
of our products and brands, we sell our menswear and womenswear
products primarily to leading upscale department stores,
specialty stores and golf and pro shops located throughout the
United States, which have the reputation and merchandising
expertise required for the effective presentation of Polo Ralph
Lauren products. Collection Brands are distributed through a
limited number of premier fashion retailers.

Our wholesale products are distributed through
the primary distribution channels throughout the United States,
Europe and other regions as listed in the table below. We also
distribute our products through Company owned stores as
discussed in the “Direct Retailing” section. In
addition, we also sell excess and out-of-season products through
secondary distribution channels.

Department stores represent the largest customer
group of our wholesale group. Significant department store
customers based on a percentage of worldwide wholesale net sales
for the year ended April 3, 2004 are:

•

Dillard Department Stores, Inc., which
    represented 14.1%,

•

Federated Department Stores, Inc., which
    represented 13.2%, and

•

The May Department Stores Company, which
    represented 10.4%.

Collection Brands, Polo Brands, and Lauren
products are primarily sold through their respective sales
forces. Our Wholesale groups maintain their primary showrooms in
New York City. In addition we maintain regional showrooms for
the Polo Brands in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles and
a Lauren regional showroom in Dallas.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical element of our distribution to department stores,
we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to
enhance brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising
of our lines by the department stores and to differentiate the
presentation of products. Shop-within-shops fixed assets
primarily include items such as customized freestanding
fixtures, moveable wall cases and components, decorative items
and flooring. We capitalize our share of the cost of these fixed
assets and amortize them using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives of three to five years.

During Fiscal 2004, we added approximately 984
shop-within-shops. At April 3, 2004, we had approximately
2,480 shop-within-shops dedicated to our products and more than
696 shop-within-shops dedicated to our licensed products in the
United States. Excluding significantly larger shop-within-shops
in key department store locations, the size of our
shop-within-shops typically ranges from approximately 600 to
1,500 square feet for Polo Brands, from approximately 600
to 1,200 square feet for our Lauren Brand, from
approximately 600 to 1,000 square feet for our Collection
Brands, and from approximately 300 to 900 square feet for
Home Furnishings. In total, we estimate that approximately
3.0 million square feet of department store space in the
United States is dedicated to our shop-within-shops. In addition
to shop-within-shops, we use exclusively fixtured areas in
department stores.



Basic Stock Replenishment
Program.

Basic products such as
knit shirts, chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered
at any time through our basic stock replenishment programs. We
generally ship these products within one to five days of order
receipt. These products accounted for approximately 6.7% of our
wholesale net sales in Fiscal 2004. We have also implemented a
seasonal quick response program to allow replenishment of
products which can be ordered for only a portion of each year.

Direct Retailing

We operate retail stores dedicated to the sale of
our products. Located in prime retail areas, our
116 full-price stores operate under the following names:

Our 147 outlet stores are generally located in
outlet malls and operate as Polo Ralph Lauren Factory stores,
Polo Jeans Factory stores, Ralph Lauren Home Factory stores and
Club Monaco outlet stores.

In addition to our own retail operations, as of
April 3, 2004, we had granted a license to an independent
party to operate one store in the United States. We receive the
proceeds from the sale of our products to this store, which are
included in wholesale net sales, and also receive royalties,
which are included in licensing revenue, from our licensing
partners sales to these stores. We generally do not receive any
other compensation from this licensed store operator. See
“Our Licensing Alliances.”

Full-Price Stores

In addition to generating sales of our products,
our worldwide full-price stores set, reinforce and capitalize on
the image of our brands. We have 6 Flagship Ralph Lauren
stores, which showcase our upper end luxury styles and products
and demonstrate our most refined merchandising techniques. We
also operate 47 Ralph Lauren stores, 2 RRL stores (to
be closed in Fiscal 2005) and 61 Club Monaco stores. During
Fiscal 2004, we added 9 full price stores, net of
3 store closings. Our stores range in size from
approximately 3,500 to over 27,000 square feet. These
full-price stores are situated in upscale regional malls and
major upscale street locations generally in large urban markets.
We generally lease our stores for initial periods ranging from 5
to 10 years with renewal options.

Outlet Stores

We extend our reach to additional consumer groups
through our 96 domestic Polo Ralph Lauren outlet stores,
22 domestic Polo Jeans outlet stores, 7 Club Monaco
outlet stores and 22 European outlet stores. During Fiscal
2004, we added 6 new outlet stores, net of 2 store closings.



Outlet stores purchase products directly from us,
including our retail stores, our product licensing partners and
our suppliers. Outlet stores purchase products from us generally
at cost, and from our domestic product licensing partners and
our retail stores at negotiated prices. Outlet stores also
source basic products and styles directly from our suppliers. In
Fiscal 2004, our domestic outlet stores purchased approximately
7.7% of their products from us, 43.8% from our product licensing
partners, and 48.5% directly from our suppliers of products.

Our Licensing Alliances

Through licensing alliances, we combine our
consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific
product or geographic competencies of our licensing partners to
create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing
partners who:

We grant product and international licensing
partners the right to manufacture and sell at wholesale and
international licenses to sell at retail, specified categories
of products under one or more of our trademarks. Our
international licensing partners produce and source products
both independently, and in conjunction with us and our product
licensing partners. Each licensing partner pays us royalties
based upon its sales of our products, subject generally, to a
minimum royalty requirement. Other than our Ralph Lauren Home
collection licenses, which are discussed below, these payments
generally range from 2.5% to 15.0% of the licensing
partners’ sales of the licensed products. In addition,
licensing partners are required to allocate between
approximately 3% and 4% of their sales to advertise our products
and share in the creative costs associated with these products.
Larger allocations are required in connection with launches of
new products or in new territories.

We work closely with our licensing partners to
ensure that their products are developed, marketed and
distributed so as to address the intended market opportunity and
to present consistently to consumers worldwide the distinctive
perspective and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually
all aspects of the design, production quality, packaging,
merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of Polo
Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior



approval and continuing oversight. The result is
a consistent identity for Polo Ralph Lauren products across
product categories and international markets.

We had 16 product, 9 international and 10 home
licensing partners as of April 3, 2004. We derive a
substantial portion of our net income from the licensing revenue
we receive from our licensing partners. Approximately 43.2% of
our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2004 was derived from three
product licensing partners: Jones Apparel Group, Inc., Westpoint
Stevens, Inc. and Impact 21 each accounted for 17.2%, 14.7%
and 11.3%, respectively, of licensing revenue in Fiscal 2004.
(See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Product Licensing Alliances

As of April 3, 2004, we had agreements with
16 product licensing partners relating to our men’s and
women’s sportswear, men’s tailored clothing,
children’s apparel, personal wear, accessories and
fragrances. The products offered by our product licensing
partners are listed below.

As described previously under the caption
“Recent Developments,” we have entered into an
agreement to acquire certain assets and liabilities of
RL Childrenswear, LLC, our Childrenswear Licensee for North
America.

International Licensing
    Alliances

We believe that international markets offer
additional opportunities for our quintessential American designs
and lifestyle image. We work with our international licensing
partners to facilitate international expansion. International
expansion opportunities may include:



Our international licensing partners acquire the
right to source, produce, market and/or sell some or all of our
products in a given geographical area. Economic arrangements are
similar to those of our domestic product licensing partners. We
design licensed products either alone or in collaboration with
our domestic licensing partners. Domestic licensees generally
provide international licensing partners with product or
patterns, piece goods, manufacturing locations and other
information and assistance necessary to achieve product
uniformity, for which they are often compensated.

International licensing partners also operate
stores, which at April 3, 2004, consisted of 37 Polo Ralph
Lauren stores, 3 Polo Sport stores, 21 Polo Jeans stores, 2
Children’s stores, 11 Ralph Lauren stores and 10 Polo
outlet stores. Approximately 11.3% of our licensing revenue in
Fiscal 2004 was derived from our partner, Impact 21.

Our ability to maintain and increase royalties
under foreign licenses is dependent upon certain factors not
within our control, including fluctuating currency rates,
currency controls, withholding requirements levied on royalty
payments, governmental restrictions on royalty rates, political
instability and local market conditions.

See “Risk Factors — Risks Related
to Our Business — Our business is exposed to domestic
and foreign currency fluctuations” and “Risk
Factors — Risks Related to Our Business —
Our business is subject to risks associated with importing
products.”

Ralph Lauren Home

Together with our licensing partners, we offer an
extensive collection of home products that draw upon, and add
to, the design themes of our other product lines, contributing
to our complete lifestyle concept. Products are sold under the
Ralph Lauren Home and Lauren Ralph Lauren brands in three
primary categories: bedding and bath, home décor and home
improvement. As of April 3, 2004, we had agreements with
eight domestic and two international home product licensing
partners.

We perform a broader range of services for our
Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our other
licensing partners. The services we perform include design,
operating showrooms, marketing, advertising and, in some cases,
sales. As a result, we receive a higher average royalty rate
from our Ralph Lauren Home collection licensing partners,
typically ranging from 15% to 17%. In general, the licensing
partners manufacture, own the inventory and ship the products.
Our Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances generally have three
to five year terms and may grant the licensee conditional
renewal options.

Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the
upper tiers of their respective markets and are offered at a
range of price levels. These products are generally distributed
through several channels of distribution, including department
stores, specialty home furnishings stores, interior design
showrooms, customer direct mail catalogs, home centers and the
Internet. As with our other products, the use of
shop-within-shops is central to our department store
distribution strategy.



The Ralph Lauren Home and Lauren Ralph Lauren
products offered by us and our domestic licensing partners are:

WestPoint Stevens, Inc. offers a basic stock
replenishment program that includes bath and bedding products
and accounted for approximately 84% of their net sales of total
Ralph Lauren Home products in Fiscal 2004. WestPoint Stevens,
Inc. accounted for approximately 68.8% of total Ralph Lauren
Home licensing revenue in Fiscal 2004. See “Recent
Developments” and “Risk Factors — Risks
Related to Our Business — Our business could suffer as
a result of consolidations, restructurings and other ownership
changes in the retail industry.”

Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative
American style associated with and defined by Ralph Lauren and
the Polo design team. Our consistent emphasis on innovative and
distinctive design has been an important contributor to the
prominence, strength and reputation of the Polo Ralph Lauren
brands.

We form design teams around our brands and
product categories to develop concepts, themes and products for
each of our businesses. These teams work in close collaboration
with merchandising, sales and production staff and licensing
partners in order to gain market and other input.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or
under the direction of, Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which
is divided into six departments: Menswear, Womenswear, Lauren,
Children’s, Accessories and Home. Club Monaco’s design
staff is located in New York and Toronto, Canada and is divided
into three teams: Menswear, Womenswear and Home.

We operate a research and development facility in
Greensboro, North Carolina, a testing lab in Singapore and
pattern rooms in New York, New Jersey and Singapore.

Marketing

Our marketing program communicates the themes and
images of the Polo Ralph Lauren brands and is an integral
feature of our product offering. Worldwide marketing is managed
on a centralized basis through our advertising and public
relations departments in order to ensure consistency of
presentation.

We create distinctive image advertising for all
our Polo Ralph Lauren products, conveying the particular message
of each brand within the context of our core themes.
Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a
specific item and often include a variety of Polo Ralph



Lauren products offered by both ourselves and our
licensing partners. Our primary advertising medium is print,
with multiple page advertisements appearing regularly in a range
of fashion, lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major
print advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and
spring retail seasons with additions throughout the year to
coincide with product deliveries. In addition to print, some
product categories have utilized television and outdoor media in
their marketing programs for certain product categories.

In general, three to four percent of licensing
related sales are spent for advertising. We directly coordinate
advertising placement for our domestic product licensing
partners. Together with our licensing partners, we collectively
spent more than $200 million worldwide to advertise and
promote Polo Ralph Lauren products in Fiscal 2004.

We conduct a variety of public relations
activities. Each of our spring and fall womenswear collections
are presented at major fashion shows in New York, which
typically generate extensive domestic and international media
coverage. We introduce each of the spring and fall menswear
collections at major fashion shows in cities such as New York or
Milan, Italy. In addition, we organize in-store appearances by
our models and sponsors, professional golfers, snowboarders,
triathletes and sports teams.

Sourcing, Production and Quality

Over 350 different manufacturers worldwide
produce our apparel products. We source finished products and
raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons and other
trim and are sourced primarily with respect to our Collection
Brands. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully
assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. We
contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or
operate any production facilities of our own. As part of our
efforts to reduce costs and enhance the efficiency of our
sourcing process, we have shifted a substantial portion of our
sourcing to foreign suppliers. In Fiscal 2004, less than 5%, by
dollar volume, of our products were produced in the United
States; and over 95%, by dollar volume, were produced in Hong
Kong and other countries. See “Risk Factors —
Risks Related to Our Business — Our business is
subject to risks associated with importing products.”

Two manufacturers engaged by us accounted for
approximately 16% and 11% of our total production during Fiscal
2004, respectively. The primary production facilities of these
two manufacturers are located in Asia.

Our product purchases are divided broadly into
three brand categories:

•

LDP Purchasing — purchases of finished
    products, where the supplier is responsible for the purchasing
    and carrying of raw materials, including all logistics and
    inbound duties and arrangements (custom and broker) to selected
    country port of entry;

•

FOB Purchasing — purchases of finished
    products, where the supplier is responsible for the purchasing
    and carrying of raw materials; and

CMT Purchasing — cut, make and trim
    purchasing, where we are responsible for purchasing and moving
    raw materials to finished product assemblers located around the
    world.

We must commit to manufacture the majority of our
garments before we receive customer orders. We also must commit
to purchase fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If
we overestimate the demand for a particular product which we
cannot sell to our primary customers, we may sell the excess in
our outlet stores or sell the product through secondary
distribution channels. If we overestimate the need for a
particular fabric or yarn, that fabric or yarn may be used in
garments made for subsequent seasons or made into past
season’s styles for distribution in our outlet stores.



We have been working closely with suppliers in
recent years to reduce lead times to maximize fulfillment
(

e.g.,

shipment) of orders and to permit re-orders of
successful programs. In particular, we have increased the number
of deliveries within certain brands each season so that
merchandise is kept fresh at the retail level.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of
our global manufacturing division and buying agents
headquartered in Asia and Europe. All garments are produced
according to our specifications. Production and quality control
staff in the United States, Asia and Europe monitor
manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct
problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have
been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance
programs, so that quality assurance is focused upon as early as
possible in the production process and flow ready merchandise
activities, allowing merchandise to be received at the
distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal
interruption.

Competition

Competition is strong in the segments of the
fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We
compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and
accessories, fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic
and foreign, including Liz Claiborne, Inc., Jones Apparel Group,
Inc., Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, Calvin Klein, Inc. and Giorgio
Armani Spa in the branded apparel market sector, and Gucci Group
N.V. and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in the luxury market
sector. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and
have substantially greater resources than us. We compete
primarily on the basis of fashion, quality and service, which
depend on our ability to:

See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating
to the Industry in Which we Compete — We face intense
competition in the worldwide apparel industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution domestically, Ralph
Lauren men’s and women’s products are shipped from
manufacturers to our distribution center in Greensboro, North
Carolina for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment to retail
customers. The facility is designed to allow for high density
cube storage and utilizes bar code technology to provide
inventory management and carton controls. Product traffic
management is coordinated from this facility. European
distribution and warehousing during Fiscal 2004 was handled by
third party distribution centers, however, with the European
restructuring, the majority of the distribution has been
consolidated into one third party facility located in Parma,
Italy.

Our full-price store and outlet store
distribution and warehousing are principally handled through the
Greensboro distribution center. We also used a facility in New
Jersey, which was



closed in Fiscal 2004. Club Monaco products are
distributed from facilities in Ontario, New Jersey and
California.

Management Information System

Our management information systems make the
marketing, manufacturing, importing and distribution of our
products more efficient by providing, among other things:

We use point-of-sale registers in our stores that
enable us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on
a real-time basis. We believe our merchandising and financial
systems, coupled with our point-of-sale registers and software
programs, allow for rapid stock replenishment, concise
merchandise planning and real-time inventory accounting.

We also utilize a sophisticated automated
replenishment system to facilitate the processing of
replenishment and fashion orders from our wholesale customers,
the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the
collection of information for planning and forecasting. We have
a collaborative relationship with many of our suppliers that
enables the Company to reduce cash to cash cycles in management
of our inventory.

Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our
merchandise primarily to major department stores across the
United States and extend credit based on an evaluation of the
customer’s financial condition, usually without requiring
collateral. We monitor credit levels and the financial condition
of our customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk.
We do not factor our accounts receivables or maintain credit
insurance to manage the risks of bad debts. Our bad debt
write-offs were $2.0 million in Fiscal 2004, representing
less than one percent of net revenues. See “Risk
Factors — Risks Related to Our Business —
Our business could be negatively impacted by any financial
instability of our customers.”

Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel
products approximately three to five months prior to the time
the products are delivered to stores. All such orders are
subject to cancellation for late delivery. As of April 3,
2004, our summer and fall backlog, including orders for Lauren
was $215.0 million and $474.8 million, respectively.
Our backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the
timing of the market weeks for our particular lines, during
which a significant percentage of our orders are received, and
the timing of shipments. As a consequence, a comparison of
backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and
may not be indicative of eventual shipments.



Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph
Lauren” and the famous polo player astride a horse
trademarks in the United States. Other trademarks we own include:

• “Chaps”

• “Polo Sport”

• “Lauren/ Ralph Lauren”

• “RALPH”

• “Polo Jeans Co.”

• “RRL”

• “Club Monaco”

• various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and
    cosmetics

In acquiring the “RRL” trademarks, we
agreed to allow Mr. Lauren to retain the royalty-free right
to use as trademarks “Ralph Lauren,” “Double
RL” and “RRL” in perpetuity in connection with,
among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks
“Double RL” and “RRL” are currently used by
the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned by
Mr. Lauren. In addition, Mr. Lauren has the right to
engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical
productions (not including or relating to our business) through
RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. Lauren.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations
and pending applications throughout the world for use on a
variety of items of apparel, apparel-related products, home
furnishings and beauty products, as well as in connection with
retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage
and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks
remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in
connection with the products and services and the required
registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use
the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the
trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and, on
a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against
infringement. See Item 3 — “Legal
Proceedings.” As a result of the appeal of our trademarks,
our products have been the object of counterfeiting. We have a
broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in
controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the United
States and in major markets abroad.

In markets outside of the United States, our
rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly
established. In the course of our international expansion, we
have experienced conflicts with various third parties which have
acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including
“Polo” and/or a representation of a polo player
astride a horse, which would have impeded our use and
registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts
are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue
our international expansion, we have successfully resolved such
conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated
settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks.
See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
Business — Our trademarks and other intellectual
property rights may not be adequately protected outside the
United States” and Item 3 — “Legal
Proceedings.”

Two agreements by which we resolved conflicts
with third-party owners of other trademarks currently impose
restrictions or monetary obligations on us. In one, we reached
an agreement with a third party which owned competing
registrations in numerous European and South American countries
for the trademark “Polo” and a symbol of a polo player
astride a horse. By virtue of the agreement, we have acquired
that third party’s portfolio of trademark registrations in
exchange for the payment of our royalties in Central America and
South America and parts of the Caribbean solely in respect of
our use of trademarks which include “Polo” and the
polo player symbol, and not, for example, “Ralph
Lauren” alone, “Lauren/ Ralph Lauren,”
“RRL,” and others. This obligation to share royalties
with respect to Central and South America and parts of



the Caribbean expires in 2013, but we also have
the right to terminate this obligation at any time by paying
$3.0 million.

The second agreement was reached with a third
party which owned conflicting registrations of the trademarks
“Polo” and a polo player astride a horse in the United
Kingdom, Hong Kong and South Africa. Under the agreement, the
third party retains the right to use the “Polo” and
polo player symbol marks in South Africa and all other countries
that comprise Sub-Saharan Africa, and we agreed to restrict use
of those Polo marks in those countries to fragrances and
cosmetics solely as part of the composite trademark “Ralph
Lauren” and the polo player symbol, as to which our use is
unlimited, and to the use of the polo player symbol mark on
women’s and girls’ apparel and accessories and
women’s and girls’ handkerchiefs. By agreeing to those
restrictions, we secured the unlimited right to use our
trademarks in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong without payment
of any kind, and the third party is prohibited from distributing
products under those trademarks in those countries.

Government Regulation

Our import operations are currently subject to
quota restrictions imposed by bilateral textile agreements
between the United States and a number of foreign countries
which continue through December 31, 2004. These agreements
were negotiated either under the framework established by the
World Trade Organization (the “WTO”) regarding
international trade in textiles, known as the “WTO
Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,” or other applicable
statutes.

Pursuant to the WTO Agreement, effective
January 1, 2005, the United States and other WTO member
countries are required, with few exceptions, to remove quotas on
goods from WTO member countries. The complete removal of quotas
should benefit the Company by allowing it to source its products
without the necessity of purchasing and obtaining quotas.
However, the Company’s business may be negatively affected
by the limited remaining quotas toward the end of calendar year
2004 and the possibility that the United States may impose
safeguard quota on products from China in early 2005. If the
elimination of quota results in import surges from certain
countries, the possibility also exists that other trade actions
may be taken by the United States to prevent imports in
injurious quantities which may adversely effect the
company’s ability to import product.

Our imported products are also subject to
U.S. customs duties which comprise a material portion of
the cost of the merchandise. See “Risk Factors —
Risks Related To Our Business — Our business is
subject to risks associated with importing products.”

Exports of certain of our US-manufactured
products into the European market are subject to increased
duties of five percent starting in March 2004 and increasing at
a rate of one percent each month through March 2005 until such
time as the extra territorial income tax exclusion act is
repealed by Congress in accordance with the WTO’s ruling
that it is non-compliant with international law.

Apparel products and other merchandise sold by
Polo may also be subject to regulation in the United States by
other governmental agencies, including the Federal Trade
Commission, United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the
Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate
principally to product labeling, licensing requirements and
flammability testing. We believe that we are in substantial
compliance with regulations, as well as applicable federal,
state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the
discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not
estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental
control matters either in the current year or expected in the
near future. Our licensed products and licensing partners are
also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing
partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations,
and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.



Although we have not in the past suffered any
material inhibition from doing business in desirable markets in
the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not
arise in the future as we expand product offerings and
additional trademarks to new markets.

Employees

As of April 3, 2004, we had approximately
13,000 employees, consisting of approximately 11,000 in the
United States and approximately 2,000 in foreign countries.
Approximately 21 of our United States production and
distribution employees in the womenswear business are members of
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial & Textile
Employees under an industry association collective bargaining
agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We
consider our relations with both our union and non-union
employees to be good.

Executive Officers

The following are our current executive officers
and their business experience for the past five years in
accordance with SEC rules.

F. Lance Isham, Age 59, who retired on
March 31, 2004, had served as our Vice Chairman since April
2000. He served as our President from 1998 to April 2000.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

Various statements in this Form 10-K or
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, in future
filings by us with the SEC, in our press releases and in oral
statements made by or with the approval of authorized personnel
constitute “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and
are indicated by words or phrases such as
“anticipate,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “project,” “we believe,”
“is or remains optimistic,” “currently
envisions” and similar words or phrases and involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may
cause actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Some of the factors that could affect our financial
performance or cause actual results to differ from our estimates
in, or underlying, such forward-looking statements are set forth
under the



heading of “Risk Factors.”
Forward-looking statements include statements regarding, among
other items:

These forward-looking statements are based
largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks
and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual
results could differ materially from these forward-looking
statements as a result of the facts described in “Risk
Factors” including, among others, changes in the
competitive marketplace, including the introduction of new
products or pricing changes by our competitors, changes in the
economy, and other events leading to a reduction in
discretionary consumer spending. We undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. In light of these risks and uncertainties, we cannot
assure you that the forward-looking information contained in
this Form 10-K will in fact transpire.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors should be read
carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the
forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any
of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
business, our operating results, our financial condition and the
actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements
are made in this report.

Risks Related to Our Business

The loss of the services of Mr. Ralph
Lauren or other key personnel could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the
design, marketing and operational areas of our business has been
a critical element of our success. The loss of his services, or
any negative market or industry perception with respect to him
or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect
on our business. Our other executive officers have substantial
experience and expertise in our business and have made
significant contributions to our growth and success. The
unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals
could also adversely affect us. We are currently not protected
by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance
covering Mr. Lauren or any of our other executive officers.
We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Lauren
and several other of our executive officers.



A substantial portion of our net sales and
gross profit is derived from a small number of large
customers.

Several of our department store customers,
including some under common ownership, account for significant
portions of our wholesale net sales. We believe that a
substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our
domestic licensing partners, including sales made by our sales
force of Ralph Lauren Home products, are also made to our
largest department store customers. Our three significant
department store customers accounted for 37.6% of our wholesale
net sales during Fiscal 2004, while our ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 46.2% of our wholesale net sales
during Fiscal 2004.

We do not enter into long-term agreements with
any of our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of
purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our
lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a
group of stores or any other significant customer, whether
motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or
otherwise, to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from
us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing
business with us or our licensing partners, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. See “BUSINESS —
Operations — Customers and Service.”

Our business could be negatively impacted by
any financial instability of our customers.

We sell our merchandise primarily to major
department stores across the United States and Europe and extend
credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial
condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the
financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail
business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk
relating to that customer’s receivables. Three of our
customers, Dillard Department Stores, Inc., Federated Department
Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company, in aggregate
constituted 40.1% of trade accounts receivable outstanding at
April 3, 2004. Our inability to collect on our trade
accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a
material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
See “BUSINESS — Credit Control.”

Our business could suffer as a result of a
manufacturer’s inability to produce our goods on time and
to our specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing
facilities and therefore depend upon independent third parties
for the manufacture of all of our products. Our products are
manufactured to our specifications by both domestic and
international manufacturers. During Fiscal 2004, less than 5%,
by dollar value, of our men’s and women’s products
were manufactured in the United States and over 95%, by dollar
value, of these products were manufactured in Hong Kong and
other countries. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders
of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality
standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements
of our customers for those items, which could result in
cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a
reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

Our business could suffer if we need to
replace manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the
production capacity of our manufacturers and import quota
capacity. Some of these competitors have greater financial and
other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in
the competition for production and import quota capacity. If we
experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing
manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our
third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that
this additional capacity will be available when required on
terms that are acceptable to us. See “BUSINESS —
Sourcing, Production and Quality.” We enter into a number



of purchase order commitments each season
specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and
quality specifications and other standard industry provisions,
but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None
of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.

Our business could suffer if one of our
manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor practices.

Two of the manufacturers engaged by us accounted
for approximately 16% and 11% of our total production during
Fiscal 2004. The primary production facilities of these two
manufacturers are located in Asia. We require our licensing
partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and
vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices
and our staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of
our independent manufacturers, we do not control these
manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor
or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one
of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent
manufacturer’s or licensing partner’s labor practices
from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States,
could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished
products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn,
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Our business is subject to risks associated
with importing products.

As of April 3, 2004, we source a significant
portion of our products outside the United States through
arrangements with over 350 foreign manufacturers in various
countries. Approximately 95%, by dollar volume, of our products
were produced in foreign countries in Fiscal 2004. Risks
inherent in importing our products include:

Any one of these factors could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. See “BUSINESS — Sourcing, Production
and Quality.”

We are dependent upon the revenue generated by
our licensing alliances.

Approximately 46.5% of our income from operations
for Fiscal 2004 was derived from licensing revenue received from
our licensing partners. Approximately 43.2% of our licensing
revenue for Fiscal 2004 was derived from three licensing
partners. Jones Apparel Group, Inc., WestPoint Stevens, Inc. and
our international licensing partner Impact 21 each accounted for
17.2%, 14.7% and 11.3%, respectively. See
“— Risks Related to our Business — An
adverse



result in the lawsuit that Jones filed against
the Company could have a material effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.” In June 2003, one of
our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens, Inc. and certain of
its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
code. WestPoint Stevens, Inc. produces bedding and bath products
for our Home Collection. On December 19, 2003, the United
States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement
between WestPoint Stevens, Inc. and us. The amended agreement
provides for the same royalty rate and minimum royalties that
are not materially less than the previous agreement.

We had no other licensing partner which accounted
for more than 10% of our licensing revenue in Fiscal 2004. The
interruption of the business of any one of our material
licensing partners due to any of the factors discussed
immediately below could also adversely affect our licensing
revenues and net income.

We rely on our licensing partners to preserve
the value of our licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also
apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of
possible risks specific to a licensing partner’s business,
including, for example, risks associated with a particular
licensing partner’s ability to:

Although some of our license agreements prohibit
licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements
with our competitors, our licensing partners generally are not
precluded from offering, under other brands, the types of
products covered by their license agreements with us. A
substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic
licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. While
we have significant control over our licensing partners’
products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for,
among other things, operational and financial control over their
businesses.

Failure to maintain licensing partners could
harm our business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we
could replace existing licensing partners if necessary, our
inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect
our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue
received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other
products. See “BUSINESS — Operations —
Our Licensing Alliances.”

Our trademarks and other intellectual property
rights may not be adequately protected outside the United
States.

We believe that our trademarks and other
proprietary rights are important to our success and our
competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the
establishment and protection of our trademarks on a worldwide
basis. In the course of our international expansion, we have,
however, experienced conflict with various third parties that
have acquired or claimed ownership rights in some trademarks
that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player
astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our
trademarks. We have in the past successfully resolved these
conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements,
none of which, we believe, has had a material impact on our
financial condition and results of operations. Nevertheless, we
cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and
protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be
adequate to prevent imitation of our



products by others or to prevent others from
seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the
trademarks and proprietary rights of others. Also, we cannot
assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership
of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we
will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to
our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
as do the laws of the United States. See
“BUSINESS — Trademarks,” and
Item 3 — “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.”

We cannot assure the successful implementation
of our growth strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend
our brands, expand our geographic coverage, increase direct
management of our brands by opening more of our own stores,
strategically acquiring select licensees and enhancing our
operations. Implementation of our strategy involves the
continued expansion of our business in Europe, Asia and other
international areas. We may have difficulty hiring and retaining
qualified key employees or otherwise successfully managing such
expansion. In addition, Europe, as a whole, lacks the large
wholesale distribution channels found in the United States, and
we may have difficulty developing successful distribution
strategies and alliances in each of the major European countries.

Implementation of our strategy also involves the
continued expansion of our network of retail stores, in both the
United States and abroad. We may not be able to purchase or
lease desirable store locations or renew existing store leases
on acceptable terms. Furthermore, we may not be able to
successfully integrate the business of any licensee that we
acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost
savings or synergies from such integration.

Our business is exposed to domestic and
foreign currency fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in
U.S. dollars. However, we source most of our products
overseas and, as a result, the cost of these products may be
affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies.
Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the
U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated
prices at which our international businesses sell products.
Furthermore, our international sales and licensing revenue
generally is derived from sales in foreign currencies. These
foreign currencies include the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the
Pound Sterling, and this revenue could be materially affected by
currency fluctuations. Approximately 32.4% of our licensing
revenue was received from international licensing partners in
Fiscal 2004. Although we hedge some exposures to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course
of business, we cannot assure you that foreign currency
fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition and results of operations. See
Item 7 — “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Our ability to conduct business in
international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory,
political and economic risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new
international markets and to maintain the current level of
operations in our existing international markets is subject to
risks associated with international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of
    foreign laws and regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory
    requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers to some
    international markets;



We are also subject to general political and
economic risks in connection with our international operations,
including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade
    relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific
    countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes,
or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the United
States, the European Union, Japan, or other countries upon the
import or export of our products in the future, or what effect
any of these actions would have on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Changes in regulatory,
geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our
business in the future or may require us to modify our current
business practices.

An adverse result in the lawsuit that Jones
filed against the Company could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and financial condition.

As a result of the failure of Jones to meet the
minimum sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2002,
under the license agreements for the sale of products under the
“Ralph” trademark between us and Jones, these license
agreements terminated as of December 31, 2003. We advised
Jones that the termination of these licenses would automatically
result in the termination of the licenses between us and Jones
with respect to the “Lauren” trademark pursuant to the
Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement between the Company
and Jones dated May 11, 1998. The Lauren license agreements
would otherwise have expired on December 31, 2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit
against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York
alleging, among other things, that we breached our agreements
with Jones with respect to the “Lauren” trademark by
asserting our rights pursuant to the Cross Default and Term
Extension Agreement, and that we induced Ms. Jackwyn
Nemerov, the former President of Jones, to breach the
non-compete and confidentiality clauses in
Ms. Nemerov’s employment agreement with Jones. Jones
stated that it would treat the Lauren license agreements as
terminated as of December 31, 2003, and is seeking
compensatory damages of $550.0 million, punitive damages
and enforcement of the provisions of Ms. Nemerov’s
agreement. Also on June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against
Jones in the Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking,
among other things, an injunction and a declaratory judgment
that the Lauren license agreements terminated as of
December 31, 2003 pursuant to the terms of the Cross
Default and Term Extension Agreement. The two lawsuits have been
consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims regarding breach of the
“Lauren” agreements and a motion to stay the claims
regarding Ms. Nemerov pending the arbitration of
Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On July 23,
2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgment in our action
against Jones, and on August 12, 2003, we filed a
cross-motion for summary judgment. Oral argument on the motions
was heard on September 30, 2003. On March 18, 2004,
the Court entered orders (i) denying our motion to dismiss
Jones’ claims against us for breach of the Lauren
agreements and (ii) granted Jones’ motion for summary
judgement in our action for declaratory judgement the Lauren
Agreements terminated on December 31, 2003 and dismissed
our complaint. The order also stayed Jones’ claim against
us relating to Ms. Nemerov pending arbitration regarding
her alleged breach of her employment agreement. On
April 16, 2004, we moved the court to reconsider its
orders, and a hearing on our motion was held on May 19,
2004. The Court has not yet issued a ruling as a result of this
hearing. We have also filed notices of appeal of the orders. If
Jones’ lawsuit were to be determined adversely to us, it
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations



and financial condition. However, we intend to
continue to defend the case vigorously and believe our position
is correct on the merits.

The royalties that we received pursuant to the
“Lauren” license agreements and “Ralph”
license agreements represented revenues of approximately
$23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in
Fiscal 2004 and approximately $37.4 million and
$5.3 million, respectively, in Fiscal 2003. We no longer
receive these royalties as a result of the termination of the
Lauren and Ralph license agreements on December 31, 2003.
We have begun to produce, market and ship the Lauren line. We
expected that the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from
Jones and the start up expenses associated with the Lauren line
would exceed the anticipated income from our sales of Lauren
products in the fourth quarter in Fiscal 2004. In total,
royalties received from Jones, including royalties from the
“Polo Jeans” license agreements, accounted for 17.2%
of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2004 and 27.2% of our
licensing revenue during Fiscal 2003. The “Polo Jeans”
license agreements were not covered under the terms of the Cross
Default and Term Extension agreement and continue in effect.

Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We
Compete

We face intense competition in the worldwide
apparel industry.

We face a variety of competitive challenges from
other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual
apparel producers, some of which may be significantly larger and
more diversified and have greater financial and marketing
resources than we have. We compete with these companies
primarily on the basis of:

We also face competition from companies selling
apparel and home products through the Internet. Increased
competition in the worldwide apparel, accessories and home
product industries, including Internet-based competitors, could
reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our
results of operations.

The success of our business depends on our
ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and
consumer demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability
to originate and define fashion product and home product trends,
as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer
demands in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad
range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with
certainty and are subject to rapid change. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the
future. In addition, we cannot assure you that any new products
or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by
consumers. Any failure on our part to



anticipate, identify and respond effectively to
changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely
affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave
us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed
opportunities. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on
markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving
inventory, which may harm our business. At the same time, our
focus on tight management of inventory may result, from time to
time, in our not having an adequate supply of products to meet
consumer demand and cause us to lose sales. See
“BUSINESS — Sourcing, Production and
Quality.”

A downturn in the economy may affect consumer
purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products,
which could adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical.
Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the
apparel, cosmetic, fragrance and home products industries,
including, among others:

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and
luxury retail products, including our products, may decline
during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable
income is lower. A downturn in the economies in which we, or our
licensing partners, sell our products, may adversely affect our
revenues. The current economic conditions have and may continue
to adversely affect consumer spending and sales of our products.

Our business could suffer as a result of
consolidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in
the retail industry.

In recent years, the retail industry has
experienced consolidation and other ownership changes. Some of
our customers have operated under the protection of the federal
bankruptcy laws. In the future, retailers in the United States
and in foreign markets may undergo changes that could decrease
the number of stores that carry our products or increase the
ownership concentration within the retail industry, including:

While to date these changes in the retail
industry have not had a material adverse effect on our business
or financial condition, our business could be materially
affected by these changes in the future. See
“— Risks Related to Our Business — We
are dependent upon the revenue generated by our licensing
alliances.”

Item 2.

Properties

Our distribution and administrative functions are
conducted in both leased and owned facilities. We also lease
space for our retail and outlet stores, showrooms, and warehouse
and office space in various domestic and international
locations. We do not own any real property except for our
distribution facility in Greensboro, North Carolina and a parcel
of land adjacent to



the facility, and Polo Ralph Lauren stores in
Southampton, New York and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

The following table sets forth information with
respect to our key properties:

The leases for our non-retail facilities
(approximately 41 in all) provide for aggregate annual rentals
of approximately $28.0 million in Fiscal 2004. We
anticipate that we will be able to extend those leases which
expire in the near future on terms satisfactory to us or, if
necessary, locate substitute facilities on acceptable terms.

As of April 3, 2004, the Company operated
263 retail stores, totaling 1.86 million square feet.
Aggregate annual rentals for retail space in Fiscal 2004 totaled
approximately $79.0 million. We anticipate that we will be
able to extend those leases which expire in the near future on
satisfactory terms or relocate to desirable locations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel
Group, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, “Jones”) to
meet the minimum sales volumes for the year ended
December 31, 2002 under the license agreements for the sale
of products under the “Ralph” trademark between us and
Jones dated May 11, 1998, these license agreements
terminated as of December 31, 2003. We advised Jones that
the termination of these license agreements would automatically
result in the termination of the license agreements between us
and Jones with respect to the “Lauren” trademark
pursuant to the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement
between us and Jones dated May 11, 1998. The terms of the
Lauren license agreements would otherwise have expired on
December 31, 2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit
against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York
alleging, among other things, that we had breached the Lauren
license agreements by asserting our rights pursuant to the Cross
Default and Term Extension Agreement, and that we induced
Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the former President of Jones, to
breach the non-compete and confidentiality clauses in
Ms. Nemerov’s employment agreement with Jones. Jones
stated that it would treat the Lauren license agreements as
terminated as of December 31, 2003, and is seeking
compensatory damages of $550.0 million, punitive damages
and enforcement of Ms. Nemerov’s agreement. Also on
June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Jones in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking, among other
things, an injunction and a declaratory judgment that the Lauren
license agreements would terminate as of December 31, 2003
pursuant to the terms of the Cross Default and Term Extension
Agreement. The two lawsuits were consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims regarding breach of the
“Lauren” agreements and a motion to stay the claims
regarding Ms. Nemerov pending the arbitration of
Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On July 23,
2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgment in our action
against Jones, and on August 12, 2003, we filed a
cross-motion



for summary judgment. Oral argument on the
motions was heard on September 30, 2003. On March 18,
2004, the Court entered orders (i) denying our motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims against us for breach of the Lauren
agreements and (ii) granting Jones’ motion for summary
judgement in our action for declaratory judgement that the
Lauren agreements terminated on December 31, 2003 and
dismissing our complaint. The order also stayed Jones’
claim against us relating to Ms. Nemerov pending
arbitration regarding her alleged breach of her employment
agreement. On April 16, 2004, we moved the court to
reconsider its orders, and a hearing on our motion was held on
May 19, 2004. The Court has not yet issued a ruling as a
result of this hearing. We have also filed notices of appeal of
the orders. If Jones’ lawsuit were to be determined
adversely to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. However, we
intend to continue to defend the case vigorously and believe our
position is correct on the merits.

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of
the Company’s stores filed a lawsuit against us and our
Polo Retail, LLC subsidiary in the United States District Court
for the District of Northern California alleging violations of
California antitrust and labor laws. The plaintiff purports to
represent a class of employees who have allegedly been injured
by a requirement that certain retail employees purchase and wear
Company apparel as a condition of their employment. The
complaint, as amended, seeks an unspecified amount of actual and
punitive damages, disgorgement of profits and injunctive and
declaratory relief. The Company answered the amended complaint
on November 4, 2002. A hearing on cross motions for summary
judgment on the issue of whether the Company’s policies
violated California law took place on August 14, 2003. The
Court granted partial summary judgment with respect to certain
of the plaintiff’s claims, but concluded that more
discovery was necessary before it could decide the key issue as
to whether the Company had maintained for a period of time a
dress code policy that violated California law. The Court
ordered the parties to conduct limited discovery to that end.
Discovery has been stayed pending the outcome of voluntary
mediation between the parties, which commenced on May 12,
2004.

On April 14, 2003, a second putative class
action was filed in the San Francisco Superior Court. This
suit, brought by the same attorneys, alleges near identical
claims to these in the federal class action. The class
representatives consist of former employees and the plaintiff in
the federal court action. Defendants in this class action
include us and our Polo Retail, LLC, Fashions Outlet of America,
Inc., Polo Retail, Inc. and San Francisco Polo, Ltd.
subsidiaries as well as a non-affiliated corporate defendant and
two current managers. As in the federal action, the complaint
seeks an unspecified amount of action and punitive restitution
of monies spent, and declaratory relief. The state court class
action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal class
action.

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit
against the United States Polo Association Inc., Jordache, Ltd.
and certain other entities affiliated with them, alleging that
the defendants were infringing on our famous trademarks. This
lawsuit continues to proceed as both sides are awaiting the
court’s decision on various motions. In connection with
this lawsuit, on July 19, 2001, the United States Polo
Association and Jordache filed a lawsuit against us in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. This suit, which is effectively a counterclaim by them in
connection with the original trademark action, asserts claims
related to our actions in connection with our pursuit of claims
against the United States Polo Association and Jordache for
trademark infringement and other unlawful conduct. Their claims
stem from our contacts with the United States Polo
Association’s and Jordache’s retailers in which we
informed these retailers of our position in the original
trademark action. All claims and counterclaims have been
settled, except for the Company’s claims that the
defendants violated the Company’s trademark rights. We did
not pay any damages in this settlement. No date has been set for
trial yet.



On December 5, 2003, United States Polo
Association, USPA Properties, Inc., Global Licensing Sverige and
Atlas Design AB (collectively, “USPA”) filed a Demand
for Arbitration against the Company in Sweden under the auspices
of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution seeking a
declaratory judgement that USPA’s so-called Horseman symbol
does not infringe on Polo Ralph Lauren’s trademark and
other rights. No claim for damages is stated. On
February 19, 2004, we answered the Demand for Arbitration,
contesting the arbitrability of USPA’s claim for
declaratory relief. We also asserted our own counterclaim,
seeking a judgement that the USPA’s Horseman symbol
infringes on our trademark and other rights. We also seek
injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. On
March 5, 2004, USPA answered our counterclaim, denying the
allegations set forth therein. A hearing has been set in this
matter for June 29, June 30, July 1,
August 28 and August 29. We will continue to contest
the arbitrability of USPA’s claim for declaratory relief
and, continue vigorously to pursue our counterclaim and contest
the claim lodged against us by USPA.

In December 2003, we received a demand on behalf
of a stockholder to inspect the Company’s books and records
relating to the amended and restated employment agreement dated
June 23, 2003 between the Company and Ralph Lauren. The
demand asserts that the purpose of the inspection is to
determine, among other things, whether the directors of the
Company breached their fiduciary duties in approving the
compensation provided for in the employment agreement. While we
have provided certain documents to the stockholder’s
counsel pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, we believe that
the issues asserted by the demand are without merit.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in
legal claims involving trademark and intellectual property,
licensing, employee relations and other matters incidental to
our business. We believe that the resolution of these other
matters currently pending will not individually or in aggregate
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
    Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended
April 3, 2004.

Overview

We operate in three integrated business operation
segments: wholesale, retail and licensing.

Wholesale consists of women’s and men’s
apparel designed and marketed worldwide, which are divided
primarily into three groups: Polo Brands, Lauren and Collection
Brands. In each of the wholesale groups, we offer discrete brand
offerings, directed by teams comprising design, merchandising,
sales and production staff who work together to conceive,
develop and merchandise product groupings organized to convey a
variety of design concepts. This segment includes the core
business Polo Ralph Lauren as well as Lauren, Blue Label, Polo
Golf, RLX Polo Sport, Women’s Ralph Lauren Collection and
Black Label, and Men’s Purple Label Collection.

Retail consists of our worldwide Ralph Lauren
retail operations that sell the product through full-price and
outlet stores and Club Monaco full-price and outlet stores.

Licensing consists of product, international and
home licensing alliances, each of which pay us royalties based
upon sales of our product, and are generally subject to minimum
royalty payments. We work closely with our licensing partners to
ensure that products are developed, marketed and distributed in
a manner consistent with the distinctive perspective and
lifestyle associated with our brand.

Fiscal 2004 Overall Results

During Fiscal 2004, overall revenue increased
$210.3 million or 8.6% primarily as a result of strong
growth in our retail business and the introduction of the Lauren
line in our Wholesale business, partially offset primarily by
planned sales declines in our Men’s Wholesale business due
to a reduction in off price sales. Our licensing revenue
increased $18.8 million or 7.5% as a result of growth in
the footwear business, as well as the incremental effect of the
consolidation



of revenues from the Japanese master license,
partially offset by the loss of licensing income from the Lauren
label, previously operated by Jones Apparel Group, Inc. The
inclusion of the 53rd week was responsible for an estimated
$39.5 million of the sales increase.

Gross profit increased $115.7 million or
9.6% and our gross margin as a percentage of sales (gross margin
rate) increased to 49.9% from 49.5% in the prior year. The
increasing gross profit rate reflects the benefits of
advertising, improved product mix and targeted marketing as well
as a continued focus on inventory management.

Operating expenses increased $125.2 million
or 13.8% primarily as a result of start up expenses associated
with the Lauren line and the increased operating expenses
associated with our growth in retail sales.

During Fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring
charges of $19.6 million. These charges are composed of an
additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs
associated primarily with two Club Monaco retail properties
included in our 2001 operational plan due to real estate market
factors that were less favorable than originally estimated,
$7.9 million for additional contract termination and
severance costs related to the consolidation of our European
business operations and $1.3 million related to our
decision to close the RRL stores.

Our international operating results were affected
by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the increase in
net sales due to the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar was
generally offset by a comparable increase in cost of sales and
operating expenses.

Balance Sheet

Our financial position remains strong. Although
our cash and cash equivalents decreased $0.1 million, our
cash and cash equivalents net of debt position improved
$72.0 million. Cash flow from operations decreased by
$59.9 million primarily as a result of increases in
inventory and accounts receivable associated with the start up
of the Lauren line.

The strengthening of the Euro has had a
significant effect on certain of our balance sheet accounts
including Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Accounts Payable and
Long Term Debt.

Recent Developments

On May 25, 2004, the Company entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire certain of the assets and to
assume certain of the liabilities of RL Childrenswear Company,
LLC relating to the Childrenswear Licensee’s licensed
childrenswear apparel business in the United States, Canada and
Mexico (the “Childrenswear Business”). The purchase
price for the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business will be
$232.1 million in cash payable at closing, subject to a
working capital adjustment, plus up to an additional
$20 million of deferred and contingent cash payments.
Payment of the purchase price will be funded by cash on hand and
lines of credit as required. In addition, the Company will
assume certain ordinary course trade payables and accrued
expenses of the Childrenswear Licensee and accrued vacation
obligations for the Childrenswear Licensee’s employees who
will become employees of the Company following the closing of
the acquisition. The assets of the Childrenswear Licensee being
acquired by the Company include, among other things, the
license; all inventories of the Childrenswear Licensee; certain
leases; customer lists; supplier lists; and books and records.

The Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its
affiliates and shareholders have agreed to indemnify the Company
for all of the liabilities of the Company related to the
operation of the Business prior to the closing of the
acquisition and have also agreed that they will not compete with
the Business for a period of three years after the closing date.
In addition, the Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its
affiliates will provide information system and accounting
services to the Company for a transitional period following the
closing.



The closing of the proposed transaction is
subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of
certain third party consents and the expiration or termination
of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The closing of the
transaction is anticipated to occur in late June 2004.

Our licensing arrangements with Jones Apparel
Group, Inc. (“Jones”) relating to the
“Lauren” and “Ralph” lines ended on
December 31, 2003 and we have begun designing, marketing
and selling the Lauren line as part of our wholesale business.
As discussed in Item 1 — “Business-Recent
Developments” and Item 3 — “Legal
Proceedings”, we are currently in litigation with Jones
over the termination of the Lauren licenses. If the Jones
litigation were to be determined adversely to us, it could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial position. However, we intend to continue to defend the
case vigorously and believe our position is correct on the
merits.

The royalties that we received pursuant to the
“Lauren” license agreements and “Ralph”
license agreements represented revenues of approximately
$23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in
Fiscal 2004 prior to the termination of these licenses on
December 31, 2003 and $37.4 million and
$5.3 million respectively during Fiscal 2003. We
expect that the income from our sales of Lauren products will at
least replace the royalty income previously attributable to the
Lauren and Ralph license agreements for Fiscal 2005. In total,
royalties received from Jones, including royalties from the
“Polo Jeans” license agreements, accounted for 17.2%
and 27.2% of our aggregate licensing revenue for Fiscal 2004 and
Fiscal 2003 respectively. Our “Polo Jeans” license
agreements with Jones continue in effect.

In June 2003, one of our licensing partners,
WestPoint Stevens, Inc., and certain of its affiliates
(“WestPoint”) filed a voluntary petition for
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint produces bedding and bath product in
our Home Collection. On December 19, 2003, the United
States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement
between WestPoint and us, which provides for the same royalty
rate and minimum royalties that are not materially lower than
under the previous agreement.

Recent Acquisitions

In February 2003, we acquired a 50% controlling
interest in the Japanese master license for the Polo Ralph
Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in Japan. All
of the revenues and expenses for the Japanese master license are
included in our consolidated statements of operations, and we
record minority interest expense to reflect the share of
earnings or losses allocable to the 50% minority interest holder
in the Japanese master license. These amounts are included in
Other (income) expense, net, in the consolidated statements of
operations. We recorded minority interest expense of
$1.4 million for the year ended April 3, 2004.

Also, in February 2003, we acquired an 18% equity
interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo
Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in
Japan. In May 2003, we acquired an additional 2% equity interest
in this company. For the year ended April 3, 2004, we
recorded $5.5 million of equity investment income related
to this 20% investment in Other (income) expense, net in the
consolidated statements of operations. Results for our 50%
interest in the Japanese master license and the 20% equity
interest in the holder of the Japanese sublicenses are reported
on a one-month lag.

Restructurings

During Fiscal 2004, we determined that the two
remaining RRL stores would be closed. In connection with this
decision we recorded a $1.3 million restructuring charge
for lease termination costs and fixed asset impairments.



During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic
review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to
centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business
operations. The major initiatives of the plan included the
following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in
three countries to one location, the consolidation of our
European logistics operations to Italy and the migration of all
European information systems to a standard global system. In
connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company
recorded a restructuring charge of $7.9 million during
Fiscal 2004 and a $14.4 million charge during Fiscal 2003,
of which $17.1 million had been paid through April 3,
2004. It is expected that this plan will be completed and the
remaining liabilities will be paid in Fiscal 2005.

During Fiscal 2001, we implemented the 2001
Operational Plan. Due to real estate market factors that were
less favorable than originally estimated, we recorded an
additional $10.4 million charge during Fiscal 2004. We
expect to settle the remaining liabilities in Fiscal 2005 or in
accordance with contract terms.

Results of Operations

The table below sets forth results in millions of
dollars and the percentage relationship to net revenues of
certain items in our consolidated statements of income for our
last three fiscal years:

Consolidation of European Entities —
Change in Reporting Period

Effective December 30, 2001, for reporting
purposes, the Company changed the fiscal year ends of its
European subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial
statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform
with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of
the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on a
three-month lag with a fiscal year ending December 31.
Accordingly, the net activity shown below for the three-month
period ended December 29, 2001, for those European
subsidiaries is reported as an adjustment



to retained earnings in the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2002 in the accompanying financial statements:

Net income for the year ended March 30,
2002, for the consolidated Company if the European subsidiaries
remained on a three-month lag would have been
$159.7 million.

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal

Net Revenues.

Net revenues for Fiscal 2004 were $2.650 billion, an
increase of $210.3 million over net revenues for Fiscal
2003. This increase was primarily due to increases in our retail
segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store
sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the
strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar. Also contributing to the
sales increase was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2004 compared to
52 weeks in Fiscal 2003. The 53rd week was responsible
for an estimated $39.5 million of the sales increase.
Further influencing the increase in net revenues were overall
increases in licensing revenues driven by the incremental effect
of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master
license and improved results in the footwear business.
Additionally, wholesale revenues increased as a result of the
sale of Lauren products commencing in the third quarter of
fiscal year 2004. These increases were partially offset by
decreased sales in our wholesale business primarily driven by
planned reductions in off price sales in our men’s,
women’s and European business as well as the loss of the
Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues for our
business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands).

Wholesale net
sales

increased primarily due to
the addition of the Lauren line, which accounted for net sales
of approximately $109.8 million in the current year
partially offset by:

•

a $60.4 million decrease in the domestic
    men’s wholesale business, which resulted from a planned
    reduction in off-price sales and a reduction in spring sales due
    to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers.

•

the elimination of the women’s Ralph Lauren
    Sport line, which accounted for net sales of approximately
    $12.3 million in the prior year.

•

decreases in the European wholesale business,
    primarily due to the soft economic conditions in Europe, of
    approximately $65.4 million on a constant dollar basis,
    offset by a $45.1 million favorable impact due to a
    stronger Euro in the current period.



Retail net
sales

increased primarily as a
result of:

•

a $43.7 million, or 14.4%, increase in
    comparable full-price store sales and a $48.8 million, or
    7.6%, increase in comparable outlet store sales on a constant
    dollar basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004,
    comparable store sales increased 12.2% and 5.7% in full-price
    and outlet stores, respectively, on a constant dollar basis.
    Comparable store sales for the 53 weeks increased 18.0% and
    8.8% for the full price stores and the outlet stores,
    respectively, while comparable store sales on a on a
    52 week basis increased 15.8% for full price stores and
    6.9% for outlet stores. Comparable store sales information
    includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores.

•

worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2004,
    the Company added 15 stores and closed 7 stores. Our total store
    count at April 3, 2004 was 263 stores compared to 255
    stores at March 29, 2003.

•

the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in the
    current period, accounted for approximately $27.0 million
    of the increase in net sales.

Licensing
revenue

increased primarily as a
result of:

•

a $27.5 million increase in international
    licensing primarily due to the incremental effect of the
    consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license.

•

$3.5 million increase in domestic licensing
    due to improvements in the footwear business.

•

partially offset by the loss of
    $15.8 million of Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones
    compared to the prior year.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased $115.7 million, or 9.6%, for Fiscal
2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the
increases discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net
revenues increased to 49.9% from 49.5%. This increase reflects a
change in business mix, with retail sales representing 44.2% of
revenues in Fiscal 2004 compared to 41.1% in Fiscal 2003 and
improved margins in our Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco retail
stores. The increasing gross profit rate also reflects higher
realized sales dollars resulting from a combination of improved
product mix as well as the benefits of advertising and targeted
marketing. The rate improvement also reflects a continued focus
on inventory management. Although our inventory balance at
April 3, 2004 is approximately the same as it was at
March 29, 2003, this primarily reflects the appreciation of
the Euro, inventories related to our Lauren wholesale business
and increased levels of inventory related to our retail growth
offset by decreases in inventory in other lines of business.

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses.

SG&A increased
$125.2 million, or 13.8%, to $1.030 billion during
Fiscal 2004 from $904.8 million during Fiscal 2003.
SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 38.9% from
37.1%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by:

•

Higher selling salaries and related costs of
    $43.4 million, exclusive of the effect of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the increase in
    retail sales and worldwide store expansion.

•

Approximately $30.4 million of the increase
    in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange
    rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of
    the Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004.

•

Expenses of $28.1 million associated with
    the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate
    and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues
    received.



•

$19.0 million of increased international
    licensing SG&A primarily due to the consolidation of
    incremental expenses in connection with the Japanese master
    license.

Restructuring
Charge.

We recorded restructuring
charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004 compared to
restructuring charges of $14.4 million during Fiscal 2003.
The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charge is comprised of an
additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs
primarily associated with two Club Monaco retail properties
included in our 2001 Operational Plan due to real estate market
factors that were less favorable than originally estimated,
$7.9 million for additional contract termination and
severance costs related to the consolidation of our European
business operations (approximately $6.7 million for the
wholesale business and $1.2 million for the retail
business) and $1.3 million for lease termination and asset
write-offs associated with the March 2004 decision to close our
RRL stores. The Fiscal 2003 restructuring charge of
$14.4 million related to severance and contract termination
costs in connection with the consolidation of our European
business operations.

Income (Loss) from
Operations.

Income from operations
decreased $14.6 million, or 5.1%, in Fiscal 2004 compared
to Fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease
in wholesale operating profits, restructuring charges, the
decrease in Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones following the
license termination in December 2003 and the start up expenses
associated with the Lauren line. These decreases were partially
offset by an increase in the retail segment’s profits.
Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the
stronger Euro and Canadian dollar period because the increased
sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were
substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses.
Income from operations for our business segments are provided
below (Dollars in thousands).

Wholesale operating income

decreased primarily as a result of
decreased net sales in our domestic mens business and European
wholesale operations. The incremental effect of Lauren sales in
the fourth quarter on our wholesale business’ income from
operations was largely offset by start up and ordinary operating
expenses associated with the Lauren wholesale business.

Retail operating income

increased primarily as a result of
increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage
of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the
increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection
with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion.

Licensing income

decreased primarily due to the
loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. This decrease
was partially offset by improvements in the footwear business
and by the inclusion of the operations of the Japanese Master
License.

Foreign Currency (Gains)
Losses.

The effect of foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of
$1.9 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to a
$0.5 million loss during Fiscal 2003. These losses
primarily related to transaction losses on unhedged inventory



purchases and royalty payments in Europe
resulting from increases in the value of the Euro compared to
the dollar. These losses are unrelated to the impact of changes
in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign
subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. In the prior
period, these losses primarily related to transaction losses on
the unhedged portion of our Euro denominated debt caused by
appreciation of the Euro until we entered into the cross
currency swap in June 2002, which were partially offset by
$1.3 million of gains recorded on the Japanese forward
contracts that we entered into in November of 2002.

Interest
Expense.

Interest expense
decreased to $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 from
$13.5 million for Fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to the
repayment of approximately $100.0 million of short-term
borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest
rates as a result of the May 2003 interest rate swap described
in “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Derivative
Instruments.”

Provision for Income
Taxes.

The effective tax rate was
36.3% for Fiscal 2004 compared to 36.5% for Fiscal 2003.

Other (Income) Expense,
Net.

Other (income) expense, net
was $(4.1) million for Fiscal 2004. This reflects
$5.5 million of income related to the 20% equity interest
in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph
Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in Japan, net
of $1.4 million of minority interest expense associated
with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in
February 2003 (except for the additional 2% equity interest in
the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May
2003).

Net Income.

Net income decreased for Fiscal 2004 to $171.0 million from
$174.2 million for Fiscal 2003, or 6.5% and 7.1% of net
revenues, respectively. Earnings per share on a fully diluted
basis decreased by $0.07 to $1.69 per share as a result of
the decrease in net income for the reasons previously discussed
and an increase in diluted shares outstanding of
1.7 million due to the exercise of stock options, a higher
average stock price and the award of restricted stock units to
executives.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal

Net Sales.

Net sales for Fiscal 2003 were
$2.189 billion, an increase of $67.0 million, or 3.2%,
over net sales for Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European
subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for
the year ended March 30, 2002, net sales would have been
$2.094 billion resulting in a current fiscal year increase
of 4.6%. Net sales results by segment were as follows (Dollars
in thousands):

Wholesale net sales

decreased $10.7 million, or
0.9%, to $1.187 billion for Fiscal 2003 from
$1.198 billion in Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European
subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for
the year ended March 30, 2002, wholesale net sales would
have



been $1.164 billion and the increase would
have been 2.0%. The increase primarily resulted from the
following:

•

Increases in the European wholesale business of
    $66.4 million, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rate
    fluctuations, which resulted primarily from continued European
    expansion and the inclusion of PRL Fashions’ operations for
    the full year, as well as;

•

$38.9 million from the favorable impact of
    Euro currency fluctuation, partially offset by a strategic
    streamlining of the amount of product sold to the department
    stores and:

•

the elimination of the women’s Ralph Lauren
    Sport and the Lauren for Men lines which contributed a decrease
    of $70.2 million.

Retail net sales

increased $77.7 million, or
8.4%, to $1.002 billion for Fiscal 2003 from
$924.3 million in Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European
subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for
the year ended March 30, 2002, retail net sales would have
been $929.4 million, resulting in a $72.5 million
increase. This increase was primarily driven by the following:

•

a $49.4 million, or 8.4%, increase in
    comparable outlet store sales, partially offset by
    $7.1 million, or 2.3%, decrease in our total full-price
    stores (comparable store sales information includes both Polo
    Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores).

•

a $9.9 million increase as a result of the
    favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation.

•

$30 million of the increase was due to
    worldwide store expansion. The Company opened 19 stores, net of
    closings during the year, ending the period with 255 stores as
    compared to 236 stores in the prior year. Included in these
    openings were 11 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, seven Club Monaco
    stores (including two Club Monaco Caban Home stores), and seven
    outlet stores (including one full line outlet store, one Polo
    Jeans outlet store and five European outlet stores). Offsetting
    these openings were the closings of three outlet stores
    (including two full line outlet stores and one Polo Jeans outlet
    store), two Club Monaco stores and one Club Monaco outlet store.

Licensing Revenue.

Licensing revenue increased
approximately $8.6 million, or 3.6%, to $250.0 million
in Fiscal 2003. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been
reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended
March 30, 2002, licensing revenue would have been
$237.4 million, resulting in a 5.3%, or $12.6 million,
increase primarily driven by increased revenues from our
international and product licensing partners of approximately
$4.2 million and $8.5 million, respectively.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit dollars increased $60.8 million, or 5.3%, in
Fiscal 2003 over Fiscal 2002. Gross profits as a percent of net
sales increased to 49.5% in 2003 from 48.5% in 2002. Had certain
of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent
fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, gross
profit percentage would have been 48.2%. The increase in gross
profit rate reflected improved product performance and
merchandise margins in the domestic retail businesses, partially
offset by a small reduction in wholesale margins.

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased
$67.2 million, or 8.0%, to $904.8 million in Fiscal
2003 from $837.6 million, as compared to Fiscal 2002. These
expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 37.1% in 2003
from 35.4% in 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries
been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year
ended March 30, 2002, SG&A expenses would have been
$845.0 million, or 36.3% of net revenues. The increase in
Fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher selling salaries and
related costs in connection with the incremental increase in
retail sales and worldwide store expansion, the expansion of the
European wholesale business, the inclusion of PRL Fashions’
operations, which was acquired in October 2002, as well as the
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily
the strengthening of the Euro. These increases were offset by
the elimination of goodwill amortization of $9.1 million as
a result of the



implementation of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” and the
recording of a gain of approximately $5.0 million related
to an assignment of the sub-lease for one store location.

Restructuring Charge.

During Fiscal 2003, we completed a
strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our
plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our
operations. The major initiatives of our plan included the
following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in
three countries to one location; the consolidation of our
European logistics operations to Italy; and the migration of all
European information systems to a standard global system. We
have completed the consultation process for consolidation of the
headquarters and anticipate completion of the consolidation and
migration during Fiscal 2004. In connection with the
implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a total
$14.4 million restructuring charge (approximately
$12.3 million for the wholesale business and
$2.1 million for the retail business).

During Fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a
$16.0 million restructuring charge for additional lease
termination costs associated with the closure of our retail
stores.

Operating
Income.

Operating income decreased
$6.4 million or 2.1% from fiscal 2002 as follows (Dollars
in thousands):

Wholesale operating income

decreased $33.9 million or
21.4% from fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries
been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year end
March 30, 2002, wholesale operating income would have
increased as a result of the increases in sales as previously
discussed and lower operating expenses.

Retail operating income

increased $21.6 million or
114.7% primarily as a result of the sales increases discussed
earlier as well as improved gross margin rates.

Licensing income

increased $6.0 million or
4.6% primarily as a result of the sales increases discussed
previously.

Foreign Currency Losses
(Gains).

The effect of foreign
currency decreased to a loss of $0.5 million in Fiscal
2003, compared to a $1.8 million gain in Fiscal 2002. These
gains are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the
dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are
converted to U.S. dollars. In Fiscal 2003, these losses
primarily related to approximately $3.2 million of
transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt in
the first quarter of the fiscal year, which resulted from
increases in the Eurodollar rate until we entered into the cross
currency swap in June 2002. These losses were partially offset
by $2.4 million of gains realized on the Japanese forward
contracts, which we further describe in the “Liquidity and
Capital Resources” section. In Fiscal 2002, the gains were
derived from transaction gains on the unhedged portion of our
Euro debt, which resulted from decreases in the Eurodollar rate.



Interest Expense,
Net.

Interest expense decreased to
$13.5 million in Fiscal 2003 from $19.0 million in
Fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily due to decreased short
term borrowings and long term Euro borrowings during Fiscal
2003. Approximately $2.9 million of the decrease resulted
from reduced interest rates as a result of the cross currency
swap, which was entered into in connection with our Euro debt in
June 2002 and is further described in the “Liquidity and
Capital Resources” section. The remaining decrease was
primarily due to lower interest rates, during the fiscal year
ended March 29, 2003. These decreases were partially offset
by higher Eurodollar exchange rates, which affect the Euro
denominated interest payments on the portion of the Euro debt
not covered by the cross currency swap.

Provision for Income Taxes.

Our tax provision for Fiscal 2003
was $100.2 million as compared to $103.5 million in
Fiscal 2002, a 36.5% and 37.5% effective tax rate, respectively.
This decline is the result of the implementation of tax
strategies.

Net Income.

Net income increased in Fiscal
2003 to $174.2 million from $172.5 million in Fiscal
2002, or 7.1% and 7.3% of net revenues, respectively. Diluted
earnings per common share was $1.76 and $1.75 for Fiscal 2003
and Fiscal 2002, respectively. The change in diluted earnings
per share resulted from the $1.7 million increase in Net
income partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in the
number of shares outstanding primarily as a result of the
exercise of stock options and additional restricted shares.

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund
growth in working capital (primarily accounts receivable and
inventory) to support projected sales increases, construction
and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in the
technological upgrading of our distribution centers and
information systems, expenditures related to retail store
expansion, acquisitions, dividends, and other corporate
activities, including the start-up costs of bringing the
“Lauren” and “Ralph” lines in house. Sources
of liquidity to fund ongoing and future cash requirements
include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents,
credit facilities and other borrowings.

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal

We ended Fiscal 2004 with $343.5 million in
cash and cash equivalents and $277.3 million of debt
outstanding compared to $343.6 million and
$349.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt
outstanding, respectively, at March 29, 2003. This
represents a $72.0 million increase in our cash net of debt
position over the last twelve months which is primarily
attributable to the following factors: (i) reduced spending
on acquisitions and investments, (ii) increased proceeds
received from the exercise of stock options,
(iii) partially offset by reduced cash flows from
operations and an increase in Euro debt of $28.9 million as
a result of the strengthening of the Euro. Additionally, capital
expenditures were $123.0 million for Fiscal 2004 compared
to $98.7 million in Fiscal 2003.

As of April 3, 2004, we had
$277.3 million outstanding in long-term Euro debt based on
the year-end Euro exchange rate, an increase of
$28.9 million from Fiscal 2003. The increase was entirely
due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. We were also
contingently liable for $35.3 million in outstanding
letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the
purchase of inventory. The weighted-average interest rate on our
borrowings at April 3, 2004 was 3.8%.

Accounts receivable increased $65.9 million
primarily as a result of the inception of sales under the Lauren
label and the strengthening of the Euro. $86.5 million of
the increase was due to Lauren and $13.2 million was due to
the change in the value of the Euro. These increases were
partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable in our
other wholesale divisions resulting from sales decreases and the
timing of payments.



Inventories decreased $0.1 million in Fiscal
2004. The inception of the Lauren line was responsible for a
$34.1 million increase and the strengthening of the Euro
caused a $14.3 million increase in inventory. These
increases were more than offset by reductions in inventory in
our Retail and Men’s wholesale business as a result of
improvements in our supply chain forecasting and management and
reduced inventory requirements in our men’s business as a
result of planned reductions in sales.

Other current assets increased $37.2 million
from Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of increases in European
Value Added Tax receivables and the effect of the timing of the
Fiscal year end on prepaid items.

Accounts payable increased $6.0 million
compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as result of the addition of
the Lauren line partially offset by reductions in our men’s
line due to a decrease in inventory purchases and reductions in
Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts.

Accrued expenses increased $71.7 million
primarily as a result of the addition of the Lauren label,
increases in the European Value Added Tax payable, and increases
in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts.

Net Cash Provided by Operating
Activities.

Net cash provided by
operating activities decreased to $210.6 million during
Fiscal 2004 compared to $269.0 million in Fiscal 2003. This
$58.4 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by
the year-over-year changes in working capital described above
and the decrease in net income of $3.2 million.

During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic
review of our European business and formalized our plans to
centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business
operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan,
we had total cash outlays of approximately $13.3 million
during the year ended April 3, 2004. We also had cash
outlays of $8.3 million during Fiscal 2004 in connection
with our 2001 restructuring plan, primarily related to lease
termination costs. It is expected that the remaining liabilities
of both plans will be paid throughout Fiscal 2005.

Net Cash Used in Investing
Activities.

Net cash used in
investing activities was $132.7 million in Fiscal 2004 as
compared to $166.3 million in Fiscal 2003. Both the Fiscal
2004 and Fiscal 2003 net cash used primarily reflected
capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading
our systems and facilities, as well as shop-within-shop
expenditures. The Fiscal 2004 net cash used also reflects
$5.4 million for an additional 2% equity interest in the
company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren
men’s, women’s and jeans business in Japan, an
additional $3.5 million primarily for additional
transaction costs to acquire a 50% interest in the Japanese
master license, $1.0 million for an additional payment on
the first earn-out payment calculation in connection with the
PRL Fashions of Europe SRL acquisition and
$7.5 million for the acquisition of a license for the use
of trademarks in November 2003. Fiscal 2003 net cash used,
reflects $78 million primarily for the acquisition of a 50%
interest in the Japanese Master license and an 18% equity
interest in the company holding the sublicenses for the Polo
Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s, and jeans business in
Japan. Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2005
approximate $143.0 million.

Net Cash Used in Financing
Activities.

Net cash used in
financing activities was $76.4 million in Fiscal 2004
compared to $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003. Cash used in
financing activities during Fiscal 2004, consisted of the net
repayment of short-term borrowings of $100.9 million and
the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset
by proceeds of $40.4 million from the exercise of stock
options. Cash used during Fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of net
borrowings of $19.7 million and repurchases of common stock
totaling $4.7 million, partially offset by
$7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.



Fiscal 2003 compared to Fiscal

We ended Fiscal 2003 with $343.6 million in
cash and equivalents and $349.4 million of debt outstanding
compared to $244.7 million and $318.4 million of cash
and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at
March 30, 2002. This represents a $67.8 million
improvement in our debt net of cash position and was primarily
attributable to changes in working capital due to the factors
discussed below, partially offset by approximately
$73.0 million of purchase price payments connected with our
acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and
an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the
sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s
and jeans business in Japan. Capital expenditures were
$98.7 million for Fiscal 2003, compared to
$88.0 million in Fiscal 2002. We acquired several retail
locations from certain of our licensees in Belgium, Germany and
Argentina for a total purchase price of approximately
$4.6 million.

As of March 29, 2003, we had
$100.9 million outstanding in short-term bank borrowings,
of which $50.0 million was repaid in April 2003 with
the remainder repaid in June 2003. Additionally, we had
$248.5 million outstanding in long-term Euro debt based on
the quarter-end Euro exchange rate. We were also contingently
liable for $19.1 million in outstanding letters of credit
primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory.
The weighted-average interest rate on our borrowings at
March 29, 2003 was 5.4%.

Accounts receivable increased to
$375.8 million, or 6.3% at March 29, 2003 compared to
$353.6 million at March 30, 2002 due to the timing of
shipments. Approximately $23.0 million of the increase
resulted from currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the
strengthening of the Euro. Improvements were made in our days
sales outstanding, however, the incremental effect of these
improvements was offset by the additional royalty receivables
recorded in Fiscal 2003 compared to Fiscal 2002.

Inventories increased $14.0 million, or
4.0%, at the end of Fiscal 2003 compared to the end of Fiscal
2002. This increase reflects the build up of certain inventory
for European retail stores as part of our continued expansion.
Additionally an increase of $23.7 million resulted from
currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening
of the Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreases
in other business lines.

Net Cash Provided by Operating
Activities.

Net cash provided by
operating activities decreased to $269.0 million during
2003 compared to $299.7 million in 2002. This
$30.7 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by
year-over-year changes in accounts receivable, inventories,
prepaid expenses and accounts payable.

During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic
review of our European business and formalized our plans to
centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business
operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan,
we recorded a restructuring charge of $14.4 million and had
total cash outlays of approximately $3.8 million during the
year ended March 29, 2003.

During Fiscal 2001 and 1999 we implemented two
plans: the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999 Restructuring Plan.
Total cash outlays related to the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999
Restructuring Plan were $9.8 million and $2.7 million,
respectively for, Fiscal 2003. As of March 29, 2003, we
settled all remaining liabilities related to the 1999
Restructuring Plan. In May 2003, we settled $4.6 million of
the remaining $5.2 million in liabilities related to the
2001 Operational Plan, the remaining $0.6 million was
settled in Fiscal 2004.

Net Cash Used in Investing
Activities.

Net cash used in
investing activities increased to $166.3 million in Fiscal
2003, as compared to $116.0 million in Fiscal 2002. Both
the Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 net cash used primarily
reflected shop-within-shops and other capital expenditures
related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and
facilities. The fiscal 2003 net cash used also reflects
$78.0 million primarily for our acquisition of a 50%
interest in the



Japanese master license and an 18% equity
interest in the company which holds the sublicense for the Polo
Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s, and jeans business in
Japan. Fiscal 2002 net cash used reflects
$23.7 million for the acquisition of PRL Fashions.

Net Cash Used in Financing
Activities.

Net cash used in
financing activities was $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003
compared to $40.3 million in Fiscal 2002. This change is
primarily due to the net repayment of short-term debt of
$12.0 million, the repurchase of $7.7 million of our
Euro debt and the repurchase of our common stock of
$4.7 million, offset by the proceeds from the issuance of
common stock of $7.7 million for Fiscal 2003; compared to
$52.2 million of short-term debt repayment,
$10.6 million of Euro debt repurchases, $2.1 million
of common stock repurchases offset by the proceeds from the
issuance of common stock of $24.5 million in Fiscal 2002.

In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to
$100.0 million of our Class A common stock. Share
repurchases were to be made in the open market over a two-year
period, which commenced April 1, 1998. The Board of
Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through
April 1, 2006. Shares acquired under the repurchase program
will be used for stock option programs and for other corporate
purposes. As of April 3, 2004, we had repurchased
4.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at an
aggregate cost of $77.5 million. As of April 3, 2004,
we had approximately $21.0 million remaining in our stock
repurchase program.

In November 1999, we issued Euro
275.0 million of 6.125% notes due November 2006. Our
Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net
proceeds from the Euro offering were $281.5 million, based
on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. Interest on the
Euro debt is payable annually. A portion of these net proceeds
was used to acquire Poloco S.A.S.(our principal European
subsidiary) and the remaining net proceeds were retained for
general corporate purposes. Through Fiscal 2004, we repurchased
Euro 47.7 million, or $43.6 million, based on Euro
exchange rates at the time of repurchase of our outstanding Euro
debt.

In November 2002, we terminated both our 1997
bank credit facility and our 1999 senior bank credit facility
and entered into a new credit facility. The 1997 bank credit
facility provided for a $225.0 million revolving line of
credit and matured on December 31, 2002, while the 1999
senior bank credit facility consisted of a $20.0 million
revolving line of credit and an $80.0 million term loan,
both of which were scheduled to mature on June 30, 2003.
The new credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and
consists of a $300.0 million revolving line of credit,
subject to increase to $375.0 million, which is available
for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It
will mature on November 18, 2005. As of April 3, 2004,
we had no debt outstanding under the new facility. Borrowings
under this facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate
equal to (i) the higher of the Federal Funds Effective
Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus
1/2 of one percent, and the prime commercial lending rate of JP
Morgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time, or (ii) the
LIBO Rate (as defined) in effect from time to time, as adjusted
for the Federal Reserve Board’s Eurocurrency Liabilities
maximum reserve percentages, and a margin based on our then
current credit ratings.

Our 2002 bank credit facility requires that we
maintain certain covenants:

•

a minimum consolidated tangible net
    worth, and

•

a maximum of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (as such
    terms are defined in the credit facility) ratio.

The credit facility also contains covenants that,
subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to:

•

incur additional debt;

•

incur liens and contingent liabilities;



Upon the occurrence of an event of default under
the credit facility, the lenders may cease making loans,
terminate the credit facility, and declare all amounts
outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The credit
facility specifies a number of events of default, many of which
are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including,
among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest
payments, to satisfy the covenants, or to maintain the required
financial performance requirements described above.
Additionally, the agreement provides that an event of default
will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to
maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of
our common stock. As of April 3, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with all financial and non-financial debt covenants.

In Fiscal 2003, the Board of Directors initiated
a dividend program consisting of quarterly cash dividends of
$0.05 per outstanding share, or $0.20 per outstanding
share on an annual basis, on our common stock. Dividends of
$0.05 per outstanding share declared to stockholders of
record at the close of business on June 27, 2003,
September 26, 2003, December 26, 2003 and
April 2, 2004 were paid on July 11, 2003,
October 10, 2003, January 9, 2003 and April 16,
2004, respectively.

We believe that cash from ongoing operations and
funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to
fund our current level of operations, capital requirements, the
stock repurchase program, cash dividends and other corporate
activities for the next twelve months.

Commitments

The following table summarizes the Company’s
contractual cash obligations by period as of April 3, 2004:

Derivative
Instruments.

In June 2002, we entered
into a cross currency rate swap which was scheduled to terminate
in November 2006. The cross currency rate swap converted

€

105.2 million,
6.125% fixed rate borrowings into $100.0 million, LIBOR
plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the cross
currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations on both principal and interest payments on our
long-term Euro debt, and to minimize the impact of changes in
the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in LIBOR, the
benchmark interest rate. The swap was designated as a fair value
hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness was
measured as the difference between the respective



gains or losses recognized in earnings from the
changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and
the Euro debt.

In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency
rate swap and entered into an interest rate swap that will
terminate in November 2006. The interest rate swap is being used
to
convert

€

105.2 million,
6.125% fixed rate borrowings into

€

105.2 million,
EURIBOR minus 1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into
the interest rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the
fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the
benchmark interest rate. The swap had been designated as a fair
value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness
is measured as the difference between the respective gains or
losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value
of the interest rate swap and the Euro debt resulting from
changes in the benchmark interest rate, and was de minimis for
Fiscal 2004. In addition, we have designated the entire
principal of the Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a
foreign subsidiary. As a result, changes in the fair value of
the Euro debt resulting from changes in the Euro rate are
reported net of income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive
income in the consolidated financial statements as an unrealized
gain or loss on foreign currency hedges. On April 6, 2004
we executed an interest rate swap to convert the fixed interest
rate on Euro 50 million of the Eurobonds to a floating
rate (EURIBOR based). After the execution of this swap,
approximately Euro 77 million of the Eurobonds
remained at a fixed interest rate.

We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce
our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory and
intercompany royalty payments. Gains and losses on these
contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either
the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains/ losses, as
applicable. At April 3, 2004, we had the following foreign
exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver Euro
67.1 million in exchange for $73.9 million through
Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 8,248 million Japanese
Yen in exchange for $71.0 million through Fiscal 2008.
At April 3, 2004, the fair value of these contracts
resulted in unrealized losses, net of taxes of $6.6 million
and $6.3 million, for the Euro forward contracts and
Japanese Yen forward contracts, respectively.

To the extent that any derivative instruments do
not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133,
they are recorded at fair value, with all gains or losses
recognized immediately in the current period earnings. In
November 2002, we entered into forward contracts on
6.2 billion Japanese Yen that terminated in February 2003.
While these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting
under SFAS No. 133, we entered into these forward
contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations on the Japanese Yen denominated purchase price
described in the agreements related to the purchase of a 50%
interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity
interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo
Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in
Japan, which were consummated during the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2003. We recognized $2.4 million of foreign currency
gains on this transaction, which are recorded in foreign
currency losses(gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

We recognize foreign currency gains or losses in
connection with our Euro debt and certain short-term foreign
currency contracts based on fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates. In connection with recording these contracts at fair
market value, we recognized $1.9 million in foreign
currency losses in Fiscal 2004, and $0.5 million in Fiscal
2003 included as a component of foreign currency losses
(gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements.

The Company does not
have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or
unconsolidated special purpose entities.



Seasonality of Business

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with
higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth
quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third
quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of
seasonal wholesale shipments to retail customers and key
vacation travel and holiday shopping periods in the retail
segment. As a result of the growth in our retail operations and
licensing revenue, historical quarterly operating trends and
working capital requirements may not be indicative of future
performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating
income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of
seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail
sales.

Fiscal 2002 reflects the change in the fiscal
year end of certain of our European subsidiaries as reported in
our consolidated financial statements. See “Consolidation
of European Entities — Change in Reporting
Period.”

In connection with our acquisition of a 50%
interest in the Japanese master license and the 18% (later
increased to 20%) equity interest in the company which holds the
sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s
and jeans business in Japan, results for these operations are
reflected in our consolidated financial statements for Fiscal
2004.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant accounting policies employed by the Company,
including the use of estimates, are presented in Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report of
Form 10-K.

Critical accounting policies are those that are
most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial
condition and the results of operations, and require
management’s most difficult, subjective and complex
judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The
Company’s most critical accounting policies, discussed
below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable,
inventories, goodwill, other long-lived intangible assets,
income taxes, accrued expenses and derivative instruments. In
applying such policies, management must use some amounts that
are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates.
Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgements and
available information. The estimates that we make are based upon
historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and
judgment of our management. We evaluate our assumptions and
estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to
assist in our evaluations.

Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate
future information, may affect amounts reported in future
periods. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or
circumstances which would result in different amounts being
reported that would materially affect our financial condition or
results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Wholesale sales are recognized when the title and
risk of loss passes to the customer and are recorded net of
returns, discounts and allowances. Returns and allowances
require pre-approval from management. Discounts are based on
trade terms. Estimates for end of season allowances are based on
historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current
economic conditions and retailer performance. The Company’s
historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
from actual results. Sales by our retail and outlet stores are
recognized when



goods are sold to consumers, net of returns.
Licensing revenue is recognized based upon shipment of licensed
products sold by our licensees, net of allowances.

Accounts Receivable, Net

In the normal course of business, we extend
credit to customers, who satisfy pre-defined credit criteria.
Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, is net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis
of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial
statements, assessments of collectibility based on historic
trends, the financial condition of our customers and an
evaluation of the economic conditions. Costs associated with
potential returns of products as well as allowable customer
markdowns and operational chargebacks, net of the expected
recoveries, are included as a reduction to net sales and are
part of the provision for allowances included in accounts
receivable, net. These provisions result from divisional
seasonal negotiations, as well as historic deduction trends net
of expected recoveries and an evaluation of current market
conditions. Should circumstances change or economic or
distribution channel conditions deteriorate significantly, we
may need to increase these provisions.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
First-in, First-out, (“FIFO”), method, or market. We
continually evaluate the composition of our inventories
assessing slow-turning, ongoing product as well as prior
seasons’ fashion product. Market value of distressed
inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for the
category of inventory involved, the impact of market trends and
economic conditions. Estimates may differ from actual results
due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory,
consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. We
review our inventory position on a quarterly basis at a minimum
and adjust our estimates based on revised projections and
current market conditions. If economic conditions worsen, we
incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur, our
estimates could be proven overly optimistic, and required
adjustments could materially adversely affect future results of
operations. The Company’s historical estimates of these
costs have not differed materially from actual results.

Goodwill, Other Intangibles and Long-Lived
    Assets

Effective March 31, 2002, we adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer
are to be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for
impairment. This pronouncement also requires that intangible
assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their
respective lives to their estimated residual values, and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase cost
over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Before
adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we amortized
goodwill on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful
life, ranging from 11 to 40 years. Beginning in Fiscal
2003, consistent with the requirements of
SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill. The
Company reviews goodwill annually for impairment. In addition,
trademarks that are owned, that have been deemed to have
indefinite lives, are reviewed at least annually for potential
value impairment. Trademarks that are licensed by the Company
from third parties are amortized over the individual terms of
the respective license agreement, which approximates
10 years. Goodwill amortization expense was
$9.1 million in Fiscal 2002. Accumulated goodwill
amortization was $23.7 million at March 30, 2002.



We assess the carrying value of long-lived and
intangible assets, with finite lives, as current facts and
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. In evaluating
the fair value and future benefits of all intangible assets, we
perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net
cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining
amortization period and would recognize an impairment loss if
the carrying value exceeded the expected future cash flows. The
impairment loss would be measured based upon the difference
between the fair value of the asset and its recorded carrying
value. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for long-lived and intangible asset writedowns
recorded in connection with our Fiscal 2001 Operational Plan and
Fiscal 1999 Restructuring Plan. During Fiscal 2004, there were
no material impairment losses recorded in connection with this
analysis.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under SFAS
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” In
accordance with this statement, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis, as measured by enacted tax rates that are
expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide
provisions for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global
business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax
outcome is uncertain. It is our policy to establish provisions
for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of
an examination by tax authorities. We establish the provisions
based upon management’s assessment of exposure associated
with permanent tax differences, tax credits and interest expense
applied to temporary difference adjustments. The tax provisions
are analyzed periodically (at least annually) and adjustments
are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those
provisions.

Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses for employee insurance,
workers’ compensation, profit sharing, contracted
advertising, professional fees and other outstanding Company
obligations are assessed based on claims experience and
statistical trends, open contractual obligations, and estimates
based on projections and current requirements. If these trends
change significantly, then actual results would likely be
impacted. Our historical estimates of these costs and our
provisions have not differed materially from actual results.

Derivative Instruments

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended
and interpreted, requires that each derivative instrument
(including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability and measured at its fair value. The statement also
requires that changes in the derivative’s fair value be
recognized currently in earnings in either income (loss) from
continuing operations or Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss), depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge
accounting treatment.

We use foreign currency forward contracts for the
specific purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in
forecasted cash flows associated primarily with inventory
purchases mainly for our European businesses, royalty payments
from our Japanese licensee, and other specific activities. These
instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and, in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, to the extent the hedges
are highly effective, the changes in fair value are included in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related
tax effects, with the corresponding asset or liability recorded
in the balance sheet. The ineffective portion of the cash flow
hedge, if any, is recognized in current-period earnings. Amounts
recorded in Accumulated



other comprehensive income are reflected in
current-period earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings. If the relative values of the currencies involved in
the hedging activities were to move dramatically, such movement
could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We
are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
which would result in different amounts being reported that
would materially affect our financial condition or results of
operations.

Hedge accounting requires that at the beginning
of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the hedge
will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment involves
an estimation of the probability of the occurrence of
transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different
assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the
results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the
timing of when changes in derivative fair values and underlying
hedged items are recorded in earnings.

We hedge our net investment position in
subsidiaries which conduct business in Euros by borrowing
directly in foreign currency and designating a portion of our
Euro denominated debt as a hedge of net investments. Under
SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of these
instruments are immediately recognized in foreign currency
translation, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), to offset the change in the value of the net
investment being hedged.

Inflation

The rate of inflation over the past few years has
not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability.

Our significant accounting policies are more
fully described in Note 1 to Our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Alternative Accounting
    Methods

In certain instances, accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection
of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s
significant policies that involve the selection of alternative
methods are accounting for stock options and inventories.

•

Two alternative methods for accounting for stock
    options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair
    value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of
    accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation
    expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the
    determination of the pro forma amounts involves several
    assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the
    fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for
    Fiscal 2004 would decrease approximately 10%. See Note 1 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

Two alternative methods for accounting for
    wholesale inventories are the First-In, First-Out
    (“FIFO”) method and the Last-in, First-out
    (“LIFO”) method. The Company accounts for all
    wholesale inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative
    methods for accounting for retail inventories are the retail
    method and the cost method. The Company accounts for all retail
    inventories under the cost method.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December, 2003, The Securities Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104
(“SAB 104”), “Revenue Recognition”.
SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject
of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must
be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from
transactions. The Company does not expect the issuance of
SAB 104 to have a material effect on the consolidated
results of operations or financial position.



In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” This
statement requires that certain financial instruments that,
under previous guidance, could be accounted for as equity be
classified as liabilities in statements of financial position.
Most of the guidance in SFAS No. 150 is effective for
all financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of
the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material
effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This
statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts, and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. This statement is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003,
except as for the provisions that relate to
SFAS No. 133 implementation issues that have been
effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15,
2003, which should continue to be applied in accordance with
their respective effective dates. The adoption of this
pronouncement did not have a material effect on the consolidated
results of operations or financial position.

In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” This
statement provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements for
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to require more prominent and more frequent
disclosures in financial statements about the effects of
stock-based compensation. SFAS No. 148 is effective
for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2002. The
Company does not intend to expense stock options; therefore the
adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” This statement required
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a
commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs
covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination
costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated
with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or
exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146 is to be
applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 146.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial
Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” which
was amended by FIN46R in December, 2003. A variable interest
entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal
structure used for business purposes that either (a) does
not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has
equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial
resources for the entity to support its activities.
Historically, entities generally were not consolidated unless
the entity was controlled through voting interests. FIN 46R
changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be
consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of
the entity’s residual returns or both. A company that
consolidates a variable interest entity is called the
“primary beneficiary” of that entity. FIN 46R
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that
a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a
significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of
FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing entities in the
first fiscal year or interim period beginning after
December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure requirements
apply to all financial statements issued after January 31,
2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity



was established. The adoption of FIN 46R did
not have a material impact on the consolidated results of
operations or financial position of the company. See Note 3
to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our interest
in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be
recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make
significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making
any payments under the guarantee is remote. Generally,
FIN 45 applies to certain types of financial guarantees
that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the
guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to
perform under an obligation agreement; indemnification
agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make
payments to an indemnified party based on changes in an
underlying that is related to an asset, liability or an equity
security of the indemnified party; or indirect guarantees of the
indebtedness of others. The initial recognition and initial
measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a
prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. Disclosure requirements under
FIN 45 are effective for financial statements ending after
December 15, 2002, and are applicable to all guarantees
issued by the guarantor subject under FIN 45’s scope,
including guarantees issued prior to FIN 45. The adoption
of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial
instruments represents the potential loss in fair value,
earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest
rates or foreign currency exchange rates.

We manage these exposures through operating and
financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of
derivative financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use
of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk
exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency
fluctuations.

During Fiscal 2004, there were significant
fluctuations in the value of the Euro to Dollar exchange rate.
In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap to
minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the
long-term Euro debt and the impact of fluctuations in the
interest rate on the fair value of the long-term Euro debt. In
May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap, and
entered into an interest rate swap, to minimize the impact of
changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in
EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The following quantitative
disclosures are based on quoted market prices and theoretical
pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for
the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into
consideration the underlying terms and maturities. These
quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible
loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates

We are exposed to market risk related to changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. We have assets and
liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to
international subsidiaries. At April 3, 2004, we had
outstanding foreign exchange contracts in Europe and Japan to
purchase $144.9 million U.S. dollars through March
2004. We believe that these financial instruments should not
subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements
because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses
and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being
hedged. We are exposed to credit-related losses if the
counterparty to the financial instruments fails to perform its
obligations. However, we do not expect the counterparty, which
presently has high credit ratings, to fail to meet its
obligations.



Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to
our Euro debt. As of April 3, 2004, the fair value of our
fixed Euro debt was $292.6 million, based on its quoted
market price as listed on the London Stock exchange and
translated using Euro exchange rates in effect as of
April 3, 2004. The potential increase in fair value of our
fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse
change in exchange rates would have been approximately
$29.3 million at April 3, 2004. As of April 3,
2004, a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in exchange
rates would have had a $1.8 million unfavorable impact over
a one-year period on our earnings and cash flows.

Interest Rates

Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our
fixed rate debt. The potential increase in fair value of our
fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse
change in interest rates would have been approximately
$4.1 million at April 3, 2004. We employ a fair value
hedging strategy utilizing interest rate swaps to effectively
float a portion of our interest rate exposure on our fixed rate
Euro debt. On April 6, 2004, the company executed an
interest rate swap to convert the fixed interest rate
on

€

50 million
of the Eurobonds to a floating rate. After the execution of this
swap,
approximately

€

77 million
of Eurobonds remained at fixed interest rate.

are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit
to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms.

During the last fiscal quarter covered by this
annual report, there have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of April 3, 2004 and
March 29, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended April 3, 2004. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of April 3, 2004 and
March 29, 2003, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
April 3, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective March 31, 2002
the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company eliminated the 90-day
reporting lag for certain of its European subsidiaries. The
results of operations of these subsidiaries for the period
October 1, 2001 through December 29, 2001 are
reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended
March 30, 2002.

Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (“PRLC”) and
its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. PRLC and its
subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “the
Company”, “we,” “us,” “our”
and “ourselves,” unless the content requires otherwise.

Business

We design, license, contract for the manufacture
of, market and distribute men’s and women’s apparel,
accessories, fragrances, skin care products and home
furnishings. Our sales are principally to major department and
specialty stores located throughout the United States and
Europe. We also sell directly to consumers through full-price
and outlet Polo Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco
stores located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe,
South America and Asia.

We are party to licensing agreements which grant
the licensee exclusive rights to use our various trademarks in
connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products
in specified geographical areas. The license agreements
typically provide for designated terms with renewal options
based on achievement of specified sales targets. The agreements
also require that certain minimum amounts be spent on
advertising for licensed products. Additionally, as part of the
licensing arrangements, each licensee is typically required to
enter into a design services agreement pursuant to which design
and other creative services are provided. The license and design
services agreements provide for payments based on specified
percentages of net sales of licensed products. Additionally, we
have granted royalty-free licenses to independent parties to
operate Polo stores to promote the sale of our merchandise and
our licensees’ merchandise both domestically and
internationally.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to
March 31. All references to “Fiscal 2004”
represent the 53-week fiscal year ended April 3, 2004 and
references to “Fiscal 2003” and “Fiscal
2002” represent the 52-week fiscal years ended
March 29, 2003 and March 30, 2002, respectively.

Consolidation of European
    Entities — Change in Reporting Period

Effective December 30, 2001, for reporting
purposes the Company changed the fiscal year ends of its
European subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial
statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform
with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of
the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on a
three-month lag with a fiscal year ending December 31.
Accordingly, the net activity shown below for the three-month
period ended December 29, 2001, for those European
subsidiaries, is reported as an adjustment

POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to retained earnings in the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2002 in the accompanying financial statements.

Net income for the year ended March 30,
2002, for the consolidated Company as if the European
subsidiaries remained on a three-month lag would have been
$159.7 million.

Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting
    Policies

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Use of Estimates

Critical accounting policies are those that are
most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial
condition and the results of operations, and require
management’s most difficult, subjective and complex
judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The
Company’s most critical accounting policies, discussed
below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable,
inventories, goodwill, other long-lived intangible assets,
income taxes, accrued expenses and derivative instruments. In
applying such policies, management must use some amounts that
are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates.
Estimates by their nature are based on judgements and available
information. The estimates that we make are based upon
historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and
judgment of our management. We evaluate our assumptions and
estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to
assist in our evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on
more accurate future information, may affect amounts reported in
future periods. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events
or circumstances which would result in different amounts being
reported that would materially affect our financial condition or
results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Wholesale sales are recognized when the title and
risk of loss passes to the customer and are recorded net of
returns, discounts and allowances. Returns and allowances
require pre-approval from management. Discounts are based on
trade terms. Estimates for end of season allowances are based on
historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current
economic conditions and retailer performance. The Company’s
historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
from actual results. Sales by our retail and outlet stores are
recognized when

F-9


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

goods are sold to consumers, net of returns.
Licensing revenue is recognized based upon shipment of licensed
products sold by our licensees, net of allowances.

Accounts Receivable, Net

In the normal course of business, we extend
credit to customers, who satisfy pre-defined credit criteria.
Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, is net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis
of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial
statements, assessments of collectibility based on historic
trends, the financial condition of our customers and an
evaluation of the economic conditions. An allowance for
discounts is based on those discounts relating to open invoices
where trade discounts have been extended to customers. Costs
associated with potential returns of products as well as
allowable customer markdowns and operational chargebacks, net of
the expected recoveries, are included as a reduction to net
sales and are part of the provision for allowances included in
accounts receivable, net. These provisions result from
divisional seasonal negotiations, as well as historic deduction
trends net of expected recoveries, and the evaluation of current
market conditions. Should circumstances change or economic or
distribution channel conditions deteriorate significantly, we
may need to increase these provisions.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
First-in, First-out, (“FIFO”), method, or market. We
continually evaluate the composition of our inventories
assessing slow-turning, ongoing product as well as prior
seasons’ fashion product. Market value of distressed
inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for the
category of inventory involved, the impact of market trends and
economic conditions. Estimates may differ from actual results
due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory,
consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. We
review our inventory reserve position at least quarterly and
adjust our estimates based on revised projections and current
market conditions. If economic conditions worsen, we incorrectly
anticipate trends or unexpected events occur, our estimates
could be proven overly optimistic, and required adjustments
could materially adversely affect future results of operations.
The Company’s historical estimates of these costs have not
differed materially from actual results.

Goodwill, Other Intangibles and Long-Lived
    Assets

Effective March 31, 2002, we adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer
are to be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for
impairment. This pronouncement also requires that intangible
assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their
respective lives to their estimated residual values, and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase cost
over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Before
adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we amortized
goodwill on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful
life, ranging from 11 to 40 years. Beginning in Fiscal
2003, consistent with the requirements of
SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill. The
Company reviews goodwill annually for impairment. In addition,
trademarks that are owned that have been deemed to have
indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for potential
impairment. Trademarks that are licensed by the Company from
third parties are amortized over

F-10


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the individual terms of the respective license
agreement, which approximates 10 years. Goodwill
amortization expense was $9.1 million in Fiscal 2002.
Accumulated goodwill amortization was $23.7 million at
March 30, 2002.

We assess the carrying value of long-lived and
intangible assets, with finite lives, as current facts and
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. In evaluating
the fair value and future benefits of all intangible assets, we
perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net
cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining
amortization period and would recognize an impairment loss if
the carrying value exceeded the expected future cash flows. The
impairment loss would be measured based upon the difference
between the fair value of the asset and its recorded carrying
value. See Note 9 for long-lived and intangible asset
writedowns recorded in connection with our Fiscal 2001
Operational Plan and Fiscal 1999 Restructuring Plan. During
Fiscal 2004, there were no material impairment losses recorded
in connection with this analysis.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under SFAS
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” In
accordance with this statement, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis, as measured by enacted tax rates that are
expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide
provisions for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global
business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax
outcome is uncertain. It is our policy to establish provisions
for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of
an examination by tax authorities. We establish the provisions
based upon management’s assessment of exposure associated
with permanent tax differences, tax credits and interest expense
applied to temporary difference adjustments. The tax provisions
are analyzed periodically (at least annually) and adjustments
are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those
provisions.

Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses for employee insurance,
workers’ compensation, profit sharing, contracted
advertising, professional fees, and other outstanding Company
obligations are assessed based on claims experience and
statistical trends, open contractual obligations, and estimates
based on projections and current requirements. If these trends
change significantly, then actual results would likely be
impacted. Our historical estimates of these costs and our
provisions have not differed materially from actual results.

Derivative Instruments

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended
and interpreted, requires that each derivative instrument
(including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability and measured at its fair value. The statement also
requires that changes in the derivative’s fair value be
recognized currently in earnings in either income from
continuing operations or Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss), depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge
accounting treatment.

F-11


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We use foreign currency forward contracts for the
specific purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in
forecasted cash flows associated primarily with inventory
purchases mainly by our European entity, royalty, payments from
our Japanese entity, and other specific activities. These
instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and, in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, to the extent the hedges
are highly effective, the changes in fair value are included in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related
tax effects, with the corresponding asset or liability recorded
in the balance sheet. The ineffective portion of the cash flow
hedge, if any, is recognized in current-period earnings. Amounts
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are
reflected in current-period earnings when the hedged transaction
affects earnings. If fluctuations in the relative value of the
currencies involved in the hedging activities were to move
dramatically, such movement could have a significant impact on
our results of operations. We are not aware of any reasonably
likely events or circumstances, which would result in different
amounts being reported that would materially affect our
financial condition or results of operations.

Hedge accounting requires that at the beginning
of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the hedge
will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment involves
an estimation of the probability of the occurrence of
transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different
assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the
results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the
timing of when changes in derivative fair values and underlying
hedged items are recorded in earnings.

We hedge our net investment position in Euro
functional subsidiaries by borrowing directly in foreign
currency and designating a portion of foreign currency debt as a
hedge of net investments. Under SFAS No. 133, changes
in the fair value of these instruments are immediately
recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to offset the
change in the value of the net investment being hedged.

Inflation

The rate of inflation over the past few years has
not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability.

Alternative Accounting
    Methods

In certain instances, accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection
of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s
significant policies that involve the selection of alternative
methods are accounting for stock options and inventories.

•

Two alternative methods for accounting for stock
    options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair
    value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of
    accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation
    expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the
    determination of the pro forma amounts involves several
    assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the
    fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2004
    would decrease approximately 10%.

•

Two alternative methods for accounting for
    inventories are the First-in, First out (“FIFO”)
    method and the last-in, first-out
    (“LIFO”) method. The Company accounts for all
    inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative methods for
    accounting for retail inventories are the retail method and the
    cost method. The Company accounts for all retail inventories
    under the cost method.

Other Significant Accounting
Policies

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less, including investments in debt securities. Our investments
in debt securities are diversified among high-credit quality
securities in accordance with our risk management policy and
primarily include commercial paper and money market funds.

Property, Equipment, Depreciation and
    Amortization

Property and equipment are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets on a straight-line
basis. The range of useful lives is as follows:
buildings — 37.5 years; furniture and fixtures
and machinery and equipment — 3 to 10 years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line
method over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the
estimated useful life. Major additions and betterments are
capitalized, and repairs and maintenance are charged to
operations in the period incurred. We capitalize our share of
the cost of outfitting shop-within-shop fixed assets within
furniture and fixtures. These assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 3 to
5 years.

Officers’ Life Insurance

We maintain whole life insurance policies on
several of our senior executives. These policies are recorded at
their cash surrender value. Additionally we have policies with
split dollar arrangements which are recorded at the lesser of
their cash surrender value or premiums paid. Amounts recorded
under both types of policies aggregated $50.2 million and
$48.8 million at April 3, 2004 and March 29,
2003, respectively and are included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

During Fiscal 2003, the Company ceased paying
premiums on split dollar life insurance policies related to
officers and terminated certain split dollar arrangements. As of
April 3, 2004, $2.1 million of split dollar policies
had either been surrendered to the insurance company for cash or
bought out by the related employee.

Deferred Rent Obligations

We account for rent expense under noncancelable
operating leases with scheduled rent increases and landlord
incentives on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The
excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled payment
amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a deferred
liability. Unamortized deferred rent obligations amounted to
$45.4 million and $47.2 million at April 3, 2004
and March 29, 2003, respectively and are included in
Accrued expenses and Other, and other noncurrent liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Other Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income is recorded net of
taxes and is reflected in the consolidated statements of
stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income consists
of unrealized gains or losses on hedges and foreign currency
translation adjustments.

F-13


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Financial Instruments

From time to time, we use derivative financial
instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign
exchange and interest rates. While these instruments are subject
to risk of loss from changes in exchange or interest rates,
those losses generally would be offset by gains on the related
exposure. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative is dependent upon the intended use of the derivative.
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as Amended and
Interpreted,” requires that every derivative instrument
(including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability measured at its fair value. The statement also
requires that changes in the derivative’s fair value be
recognized currently in earnings in either income (loss) from
continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss), depending on the timing and designated purpose of the
derivative.

Note 12 further describes the derivative
instruments we are party to and the related accounting
treatment. Historically, we have entered into interest rate swap
agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts, which qualify
as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. In accordance
with SFAS No. 133, we have recorded the fair value of
these derivatives at April 1, 2001, and the resulting net
unrealized gain, after taxes, of approximately $4.0 million
in other comprehensive income as a cumulative transition
adjustment. We have also designated our Euro debt as a hedge of
our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. During Fiscal 2004,
we have entered into various forward exchange contracts that
qualified as hedges on inventory purchases and royalty payments.

Foreign Currency Transactions and
    Translations

The financial position and results of operations
of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local
currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year end.
Results of operations are translated at the average rate of
exchange prevailing throughout the period. Translation
adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates from
period to period are included in other comprehensive income, net
of taxes, except for certain foreign-denominated debt. Gains and
losses on translation of intercompany loans with foreign
subsidiaries of a long-term investment nature are also included
in this component of stockholders’ equity. We have
designated our Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a
foreign subsidiary. Prior to fully designating our Euro debt as
a hedge, transaction gains or losses resulting from changes in
the Eurodollar rate were recorded in income and amounted to
$3.2 million in Fiscal 2003. The gain of the Japanese Yen
forward contracts, that did not qualify for hedge accounting,
amounted to $2.4 million in Fiscal 2003. Gains and losses
from other foreign currency transactions are included in
operating results and were not material.

Cost of Goods Sold and Selling
    Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred
to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product
costs, freight-in, import costs, as well as reserves for
shrinkage. The costs of selling the merchandise, including
preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing,
warehousing and order charges, are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses (“SG&A”).

Shipping and Handling Costs

We reflect shipping and handling costs as a
component of SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of
income. The shipping and handling costs approximated
$61.0 million, $59.9 million and $57.4 million in
Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As a percent of
revenues, they represented 2.6%, 2.7% and 2.7% in Fiscal 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. We bill our wholesale customers for
shipping and handling costs and record such revenues in net
sales upon shipment.

Advertising

We expense the production costs of advertising,
marketing and public relations expenses upon the first showing
of the related advertisement. We expense the costs of
advertising paid to customers under cooperative advertising
programs when the related advertisements are run. Total
advertising expenses, including cooperative advertising,
included within SG&A expenses amounted to
$112.3 million, $92.8 million and $79.8 million
in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share was calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding during the period, excluding any potential dilution.
Diluted net income per share was calculated similarly but
includes potential dilution from the exercise of stock options
and awards. The difference between the basic and diluted
weighted-average shares outstanding is due to the dilutive
effect of stock options, restricted stock units and restricted
stock awards issued under our stock option plans, which were
857,266 and 932,428, and 1,052,376 shares for Fiscal 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Stock Options

We use the intrinsic value method to account for
stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and have
adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure.” Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for fixed stock option grants. Had
compensation costs for the Company’s stock option grants
been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for
awards under these plans in accordance with
SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net income and
earnings per share

would have been reduced to the proforma amounts
as follows (Dollars in thousands, except per share data):

For this purpose, the fair value of each option
grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively: expected volatility of 40.4%, 47.2% and 47.0%;
risk-free interest rates of 2.56%, 3.69% and 4.65%; expected
lives of 7.5 years, 5.2 years and 6.0 years; and
a dividend of $0.20, $0.00 and $0.00.

Reclassifications

For comparative purposes, certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period’s presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, The Securities Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104
(“SAB 104”), “Revenue Recognition”.
SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject
of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must
be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from
transactions. The Company does not expect the issuance of
SAB 104 to have a material effect on the consolidated
results of operations or financial position.

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” This
statement requires that certain financial instruments that,
under previous guidance, could be accounted for as equity be
classified as liabilities in statements of financial position.
Most of the guidance in SFAS No. 150 is effective for
all financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of
the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material
effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This
statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts, and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. This statement is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003,
except as for the provisions that relate to
SFAS No. 133

implementation issues that have been effective
for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003,
which should continue to be applied in accordance with their
respective effective dates. The adoption of this pronouncement
did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of
operations or financial position.

In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” This
statement provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements for
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to require more prominent and more frequent
disclosures in financial statements about the effects of
stock-based compensation. SFAS No. 148 is effective
for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2002. The
Company does not intend to expense stock options; therefore the
adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” This statement required
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a
commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs
covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination
costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated
with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or
exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146 is to be
applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 146.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial
Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” which
was amended by FIN 46R in December, 2003. A variable
interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any
other legal structure used for business purposes that either
(a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or
(b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient
financial resources for the entity to support its activities.
Historically, entities generally were not consolidated unless
the entity was controlled through voting interests. FIN 46R
changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be
consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of
the entity’s residual returns or both. A company that
consolidates a variable interest entity is called the
“primary beneficiary” of that entity. FIN 46R
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that
a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a
significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of
FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing entities in the
first fiscal year or interim period beginning after
December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure requirements
apply to all financial statements issued after January 31,
2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was
established. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a
material impact on the consolidated results of operations or
financial position of the company. See Note 3 regarding our
interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be
recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make
significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making
any payments under the guarantee is remote. Generally,
FIN 45 applies to certain types of financial guarantees
that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the
guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to
perform under an obligation agreement; indemnification
agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make
payments to an indemnified party based on changes

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in an underlying that is related to an asset,
liability or an equity security of the indemnified party; or
indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. Disclosure requirements
under FIN 45 are effective for financial statements ending
after December 15, 2002, and are applicable to all
guarantees issued by the guarantor subject under
FIN 45’s scope, including guarantees issued prior to
FIN 45. The company adopted FIN 45 in its
December 28, 2002 financial statement.

Acquisitions and Joint Venture

In November 2003, we acquired a license for the
use of trademarks for $7.5 million. This license was
accounted for as a finite lived intangible asset and is being
amortized over 10 years.

In February 2003, we acquired a 50% controlling
interest in the Japanese master license for the Polo Ralph
Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in Japan for
approximately $24.1 million. In connection with the
acquisition of the Japanese master license, we recorded tangible
assets of $11.0 million, an intangible license valued at
$9.9 million and liabilities assumed of $8.5 million
based on estimated fair values as determined by management
utilizing information available at this time. At March 29,
2003, goodwill of $13.0 million was recognized for the
excess of the purchase price plus transaction costs of
$1.3 million over the preliminary estimate of fair market
value of the net assets acquired. During Fiscal 2004, we
incurred an additional $3.5 million of transaction costs,
which have been included in goodwill and finalized our
accounting for the acquisition, which resulted in an additional
$0.5 million of goodwill. 100% of the revenues and expenses
for the Japanese master license are included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For Fiscal
2004, we have recorded minority interest expense of
$1.4 million to reflect the share of earnings allocable to
the 50% minority interest holder in the Japanese master license.
This amount is included in Other (income) expense, net in the
consolidated statements of operations.

Also, in February 2003, we acquired an 18% equity
interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo
Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in
Japan for approximately $47.6 million. In May 2003, we paid
$5.4 million to acquire an additional 2% equity interest in
this company. For Fiscal 2004, we recorded $5.5 million of
equity investment income related to this investment. This amount
is included in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated
statements of operations.

Results for our 50% interest in the Japanese
master license and the 20% equity interest are reported on a
one-month lag.

During Fiscal 2003, we acquired several retail
locations from certain of our licensees in Belgium, Germany, and
Argentina for a total purchase price of $4.6 million.

At April 3, 2004, the Company’s
accounting for the Fiscal 2003 acquisitions has been finalized.
Unaudited proforma information related to these acquisitions is
not included since the impact of these transactions are not
material to the consolidated results of the Company.

On October 31, 2001, the Company completed
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of PRL
Fashions of Europe S.R.L. (“PRL Fashions” or
“Italian Licensee”) which held licenses to sell our
women’s Ralph Lauren apparel in Europe, our men’s and
boys’ Polo Ralph Lauren apparel in Italy and men’s and
women’s Polo Jeans collections in Italy. The purchase price
of this transaction was approximately $22.0 million in cash
plus the assumption of certain liabilities and earn-out payments
based on achieving profitability targets over the first three
years with a guaranteed minimum annual payment of
$3.5 million each year. The assets acquired of

F-18


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$15.1 million and liabilities assumed of
$15.1 million were recorded at estimated fair values as
determined by the Company’s management based on information
available at that time. Goodwill of approximately
$33.5 million was initially recognized for the excess of
the purchase price over the preliminary estimate of fair market
value of the net assets acquired. During the quarter ended
December 28, 2002, the Company finalized the purchase
accounting for the acquisition of the assets, the result of
which was an increase in goodwill of approximately
$0.3 million. Also, during Fiscal 2004 an initial payment
was made on the first earn-out payment calculation, resulting in
an additional increase in goodwill of approximately
$1.0 million. This adjustment and any other adjustments to
the contingent component of the remaining earn-out payments will
be accounted for as additional purchase price in future periods.
Unaudited pro forma information related to this acquisition is
not included since the impact of this transaction is not
material to the consolidated results of the Company.

On October 22, 2001, we acquired the Polo
Brussels SA store from one of our licensees. The purchase
price of this transaction was approximately $3.0 million in
cash, which was primarily allocated to goodwill. Unaudited
proforma information related to this acquisition is not
included, as the impact of this transaction is not material to
the consolidated results of the Company.

On February 7, 2000, we announced the
formation of Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (“RL Media”), a
joint venture between National Broadcasting Company, Inc. and
certain affiliated companies (“NBC”) and
ourselves. RL Media was created to bring our American
lifestyle experience to consumers via multiple media platforms,
including the Internet, broadcast, cable and print. Under the
30-year joint venture agreement, RL Media is owned 50% by
us and 50% by NBC. In exchange for a 50% interest, we provide
marketing through our annual print advertising campaign, make
our merchandise available at initial cost of inventory and sell
RL Media’s excess inventory through our outlet stores,
among other things. NBC contributed $40.0 million in online
distribution and promotion and a cash funding commitment up to
$50.0 million. NBC also initially committed to contribute
$110.0 million of television and online advertising. During
Fiscal 2003, RL Media entered into an agreement to sell its
unused television and advertising spots for $15.0 million.
Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, for tax
purposes, we will not absorb any losses from the joint venture
up to the first $50.0 million incurred and will share
proportionately in the net income or losses thereafter.
Additionally, we will receive a royalty on the sale of our
products by RL Media based on specified percentages of net sales
over a predetermined threshold, subject to certain limitations;
to date, no such royalty income has been recognized. RL
Media’s managing board has equal representation from NBC
and us. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for
this investment in which it has more than a minor equity
interest and more than minor influence over the operations, but
does not have a controlling interest and is not the primary
beneficiary. Our financial basis in RL Media is zero. Our equity
in the net assets of RL Media is less than our financial basis.
We have not recognized any losses in excess of our financial
basis since there are no financial guarantees, commitments or
obligations to fund the operations of RL Media.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective March 31, 2002, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 142. This accounting standard
requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets
are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment
tests. Other intangible assets with finite lives will continue
to be amortized over their useful lives. The transitional
impairment tests were completed and did not result in an
impairment charge. We completed our annual impairment test as of
the first day of the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. As a result
of this test, no impairment was recognized.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the
Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective
March 31, 2002, and prior period amounts were not restated.

Restructuring Charge

During Fiscal 2004, we decided to close our
remaining RRL stores, in connection with this decision we
recorded a $1.3 million restructuring charge for fixed
asset write-offs and lease termination costs.

2003 Restructuring Plan

During the third quarter of Fiscal 2003, we
completed a strategic review of our European businesses and
formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently
consolidate its business operations. The major initiatives of
the plan included the following: consolidation of our
headquarters from five cities in three countries to one
location; the consolidation of our European logistics operations
to Italy; and the migration of all European information systems
to a standard global system. In connection with the
implementation of this plan, the Company has recorded a
restructuring charge of $7.9 million during Fiscal 2004 and
$14.4 million during Fiscal 2003 for severance and contract
termination costs. The $7.9 million represents the
additional liability for employees notified of their termination
and properties we ceased using during Fiscal 2004. The major
components of the charge and the activity through April 3,
2004 were as follows (Dollars in thousands):

Total severance and termination benefits as a
result of this restructuring related to approximately 160
employees. Total cash outlays related to this plan of
approximately $17.1 million have been paid through
April 3, 2004. It is expected that this plan will be
completed, and the remaining liabilities will be paid, in Fiscal
2005.

2001 Operational Plan

During the second quarter of Fiscal 2001, we
completed an internal operational review and formalized our
plans to enhance the growth of our worldwide luxury retail
business, to better manage inventory and to increase our overall
profitability. The major initiatives of the 2001 Operational
Plan included: refining our retail strategy; developing
efficiencies in our supply chain; and consolidating corporate
strategic business functions and internal processes. Costs
associated with this aspect of the 2001 Operational Plan
included lease and contract termination costs, store fixed asset
writedowns and severance and termination benefits.

In connection with the implementation of the 2001
Operational Plan, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of
$128.6 million in our second quarter of Fiscal 2001. This
charge was subsequently adjusted for a $5.0 million
reduction of liabilities in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2001
and a $16.0 million increase in the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2002 for lease termination costs associated with the
closure of our retail stores. During Fiscal 2004, a
$10.4 million increase was recorded due to market factors
that were less favorable than originally estimated. The major
components of the charge and the activity through April 3,
2004, were as follows (Dollars in thousands):

Total severance and termination benefits as a
result of the 2001 Operational Plan related to approximately
550 employees, all of whom have been terminated. Total cash
outlays related to the 2001 Operational Plan are expected to be
approximately $51.2 million, $44.7 million of which
have been paid through April 3, 2004. We completed the
implementation of the 2001 Operational Plan in Fiscal 2002 and
expect to settle the remaining liabilities in Fiscal 2005 or in
accordance with contract terms.

1999 Restructuring Plan

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1999, we
formalized our plans to streamline operations within our
wholesale and retail operations and reduce our overall cost
structure. The major initiatives of the 1999 Restructuring Plan
included the following: an evaluation of our retail operations
and site locations; the realignment and operational integration
of our wholesale operating units; and the realignment and
consolidation of corporate strategic business functions and
internal processes.

In connection with the implementation of the 1999

POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND

The foreign and domestic components of income
before provision for income taxes were as follows (Dollars in
thousands):

The deferred tax assets reflect the net tax
effect of temporary differences, primarily net operating loss
carryforwards, property and equipment and accounts receivable,
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. The components of the net deferred tax assets at
April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003 were as follows
(Dollars in thousands):

We have available federal, state and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$10.0 million, $227.5 million and $22.1 million,
respectively, for tax purposes to offset future taxable income.
The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal
2005. The utilization of the federal net operating loss
carryforwards is subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue
Code Section 382, which applies following certain changes
in ownership of the entity generating the loss carryforward. As
a result of the limitation of Section 382, we believe that
approximately $3.3 million of the federal net operating
loss carryforwards will expire and not be utilized. A valuation
allowance has been recorded against such net operating losses.

Also, we have available state and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.1 million
and $180.0 million, respectively, for which no net deferred
tax asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has
been recorded since we do not believe that we will

more likely than not be able to utilize these
carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Subsequent
recognition of a portion of the deferred tax asset relating to
these federal, state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards would result in a reduction of goodwill recorded
in connection with acquisitions. Additionally, we have recorded
a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets
relating to our foreign operations. Subsequent recognition of
these deferred tax assets, as well as a portion of the foreign
net operating loss carryforwards, would result in an income tax
benefit in the year of such recognition.

Provision has not been made for United States or
additional foreign taxes on approximately $120.0 million of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings
have been and will continue to be reinvested. These earnings
could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends,
if foreign earnings were lent to PRLC, a subsidiary or a United
States affiliate of PRLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries
were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practical. We
believe that the amount of the additional taxes that might be
payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if remitted,
would be partially offset by United States foreign tax credits.

The historical provision for income taxes in
Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 differs from the amounts computed by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes due to the following (Dollars in

Financing Agreements

In November 2002, we terminated both our 1997
bank credit facility and our 1999 senior bank credit facility
and entered into a new credit facility. The 1997 bank credit
facility provided for a $225.0 million revolving line of
credit and matured on December 31, 2002, while the 1999
senior bank credit facility consisted of a $20.0 million
revolving line of credit and an $80.0 million term loan,
both of which were scheduled to mature on June 30, 2003.
The new credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and
consists of a $300.0 million revolving line of credit,
subject to increase to $375.0 million, which is available
for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It
will mature on November 18, 2005. As of April 3, 2004
we had no balance outstanding under the new facility. Borrowings
under this facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate
equal to (i) the higher of the Federal Funds Effective
Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus
1/2 of one percent, and the prime commercial lending rate of JP
Morgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time, or (ii) the
LIBO Rate (as defined) in effect from time to time, as adjusted
for the Federal Reserve Board’s Eurocurrency Liabilities
maximum reserve percentages, and a margin based on our then
current credit ratings. As of April 3, 2004, the margin was
0.75%.

Our 2002 bank credit facility requires that we
maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, and a
maximum Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (as such terms are defined in
the Credit Facility) ratio.

The credit facility also contains covenants that,
subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to:

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under
the credit facility, the lenders may cease making loans,
terminate the credit facility, and declare all amounts
outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The credit
facility specifies a number of events of default, many of which
are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including,
among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest
payments, to satisfy the covenants, or to maintain the required
financial performance requirements described above.
Additionally, the agreement provides that an event of default
will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to
maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of
our common stock. As of April 3, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with all covenants.

On November 22, 1999, we issued
Euro 275.0 million of 6.125% Notes (“Euro
debt”) due November 2006. The Euro debt is listed on the
London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro debt
offering were $281.5 million based on the Euro exchange
rate on the issuance date. A portion of the net proceeds from
the issuance was used to finance the acquisition of stock and
certain assets of Poloco while the remaining net proceeds were
retained for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Euro
debt is payable annually. Through Fiscal 2004, we repurchased
Euro 47.7 million of our outstanding Euro debt, or
$43.6 million based on Euro exchange rates. The loss on
this early extinguishment of debt was not material.

At April 3, 2004, we had no balance
outstanding under the credit facility and $277.3 million
outstanding in Euro debt based on the year end Euro exchange
rate. We were also contingently liable for $35.3 million in
outstanding letters of credit related primarily to commitments
for the purchase of inventory. At March 29, 2003, we had
$100.9 million outstanding in direct borrowings and
$248.5 million outstanding in Euro debt based on the year
end Euro exchange rate. The credit facilities bore interest
primarily at the institution’s prime rate. The
weighted-average interest rate on borrowings was 3.8%, 5.4% and
5.9% in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The carrying amounts of financial instruments
reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
approximated their estimated fair values, except for the Euro
debt, primarily due to either the short-term maturity of the
instruments or their adjustable market rate of interest. The
fair value of the Euro debt, net of discounts, was
$292.6 million, and $252.4 million, as of
April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003 respectively, based
on its quoted market price as listed on the London Stock
Exchange.

Financial Instruments

We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce
our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases
and intercompany royalty payments. Gains and losses on these
contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either
the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains/losses, as
applicable. At April 3, 2004, we had the following foreign
exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver

€

67.1 million
in exchange for $73.9 million through Fiscal 2005 and
(ii) to deliver ¥8,248 million in exchange for
$71.0 million through Fiscal 2008. At April 3, 2004,
the fair value of these contracts resulted in unrealized losses,
net of taxes of $6.6 million and $6.3 million, for the
Euro forward contracts and Japanese Yen forward contracts
respectively.

In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency
rate swap, and entered into an interest rate swap that
terminates in November 2006. The interest rate swap is being
used to convert Euro 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate
borrowings into Euro 105.2 million, EURIBOR minus
1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the interest
rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of
the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest
rate. The swap has been designated as a fair value hedge under
SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured as the
difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in
earnings from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate
swap and the Euro debt resulting from changes in the benchmark
interest rate, and was de minimis for Fiscal 2004. In addition,
we have designated the entire principal of the Euro debt as a
hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. As
a result, changes in the fair value of the Euro debt resulting
from changes in the Euro rate are reported net of income taxes
in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated
financial statements as an unrealized gain or loss on foreign
currency hedges. On April 6, 2004 the Company executed an
interest rate swap to convert the fixed interest rate on

€

50 million
of the Eurobonds to a floating rate (EURIBOR based). After the
execution of this swap,
approximately

€

77 million
of the Eurobonds remained at a fixed interest rate.

In November 2002, the Company entered into
forward contracts on 6.2 billion Japanese Yen that
terminated in February 2003. These forward contracts were
entered into to minimize the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations on the Japanese Yen purchase price in connection
with the transactions described in Note 3. The forward
contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting under
SFAS No. 133 and as such the changes in the fair value
of the contracts were recognized currently in earnings. In
connection with accounting for these contracts during Fiscal
2003, the Company recognized $2.4 million of foreign
exchange gain on these forward contracts, included as a
component of foreign currency losses (gains), in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.

In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency
rate swap, which was scheduled to terminate in November 2006.
The cross currency rate swap was being used to convert
Euro 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into
$100.0 million, LIBOR plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings.
We entered into the cross currency rate swap to minimize the
impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in both principal and
interest payments resulting from Euro debt, and to minimize the
impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to
changes in LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap had been
designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133.
Hedge ineffectiveness was measured as the difference between the
respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the
changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and
the Euro debt.

In April 1999, we entered into interest rate swap
agreements with commercial banks which expired in 2003 to hedge
against interest rate fluctuations. The swap agreements
effectively

F-28

SUBSIDIARIES

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

converted borrowings under the 2002 bank credit
facility from variable rate to fixed rate obligations. Under the
terms of these agreements, we made payments at a fixed rate of
5.5% and received payments from the counterparty based on the
notional amount of $100.0 million at a variable rate based
on LIBOR. The net interest paid or received on this arrangement
was included in interest expense. The fair value of these
agreements was based upon the estimated amount that we would
have to pay to terminate the agreements, as determined by the
financial institutions. The fair value of these agreements was
an unrealized loss of $1.3 million at March 29, 2003,
all of which was reclassified into earnings during Fiscal 2004;
and an unrealized loss of $2.6 million at March 30,
2002.

As of April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003,
the Company was party to the following contracts (Dollars in
millions):

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

We lease office, warehouse and retail space and
office equipment under operating leases which expire through
2029. As of April 3, 2004, aggregate minimum annual rental
payments under noncancelable operating leases with lease terms
in excess of one year were payable as follows (Dollars in
thousands):

Rent expense charged to operations was
$107.0 million, $98.2 million and $83.2 million
in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, net of sub-lease
income. Substantially all outlet and retail store leases provide
for contingent rentals based upon sales and require us to pay
taxes, insurance and occupancy costs. Certain rentals are based
solely on a percentage of sales. Contingent rental charges
included in rent expense were $8.1 million,
$6.9 million and $6.2 million in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. These rental amounts exclude associated
costs such as real estate taxes and common area maintenance.

Employment Agreements

We are party to employment agreements with
certain executives which provide for compensation and certain
other benefits. The agreements also provide for severance
payments under certain circumstances.

Acquisitions

See Note 3 for information regarding
contingent payments related to acquisitions made by the Company.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We sell our merchandise primarily to major
upscale department stores across the United States and extend
credit based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial
condition generally without requiring collateral. Credit risk is
driven by conditions or occurrences within the economy and the
retail industry and is principally dependent on each
customer’s financial condition. A decision by the
controlling owner of a group of stores or any substantial
customer to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us
or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse
effect. We had three customers who in aggregate constituted
approximately 40.1% and 30.0% of trade accounts receivable
outstanding at April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003,
respectively.

We had three significant customers who accounted
for approximately 14.1%, 13.2% and 10.4% each of worldwide
wholesale net sales, in Fiscal 2004. These three significant
customers accounted for approximately 12.5%, 9.7% and 8.4% each
of net sales in Fiscal 2003, and for approximately 17.3%, 16.1%
and 15.6% each of net sales in Fiscal 2002. Additionally, we had
four significant licensees who in aggregate constituted
approximately 50%, 51% and 55% of licensing revenue in Fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

We monitor credit levels and the financial
condition of our customers on a continuing basis to minimize
credit risk. We believe that adequate provision for credit loss
has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

We are also subject to concentrations of credit
risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, cross currency swap agreement, interest rate swap
agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts which we
attempt to minimize by entering into these arrangements with
major banks and financial institutions and investing in
high-quality instruments. We do not expect any counterparties to
fail to meet their obligations.

Declaration of Dividend

On May 20, 2003, the Board of Directors
initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend program of
$0.05 per share, or $0.20 per share on an annual
basis, on Polo Ralph Lauren common stock. The fourth quarter
dividend was payable to shareholders of record at the close of
business on April 2, 2004 and was paid on April 16,
2004.

Licensing Commitments

As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel
Group, including its subsidiaries (“Jones”), to meet
the minimum sales volumes for the year ended December 31,
2002, under the license agreements for the sale of products
under the “Ralph” trademark between us and Jones dated
May 11, 1998, these license agreements terminated as of
December 31, 2003. We advised Jones that the termination of
these licenses automatically resulted in the termination of the
licenses between us and Jones with respect to the
“Lauren” trademark pursuant to the Cross Default and
Term Extension Agreement, between us and Jones dated
May 11, 1998. The Lauren license agreements would otherwise
expire on December 31, 2006. The royalties that we received
pursuant to the “Lauren” license agreements and
“Ralph” license agreements represented revenues in
Fiscal 2003 of approximately $37.4 million and
$5.3 million, respectively. Jones has reported that net

sales of Lauren and Ralph products for the year
ended December 31, 2002 were $548.0 million and
$37.0 million, respectively. See Note 20 for
additional information on this matter.

Other Commitments

The Company is not party to any off-balance sheet
transactions or unconsolidated special purpose entities for any
of the periods presented herein.

Earnings Per Share

Basic EPS is calculated based on income available
to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding during the reported period. Diluted EPS includes
additional dilution from potential common stock issuable
pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding and is
calculated under the treasury stock method. The weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding used to calculate Basic EPS
is reconciled to those shares used in calculation Diluted EPS as
follows:

Options to purchase shares of common stock at an
exercise price greater than the average market price of the
common stock are anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share.

15.

Common Stock

All of our outstanding Class B common stock
is owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities and all
of our formerly outstanding Class C common stock was owned
by certain investment funds affiliated with The Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc. (“GS Group”). Shares of Class B
common stock are convertible at any time into shares of
Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and may not be
transferred to anyone other than affiliates of Mr. Lauren.
Shares of Class C common stock were convertible at any time
into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.
During Fiscal 2003, 11.0 million shares of Class C
common stock were converted into Class A common stock and
sold in a secondary stock offering. During Fiscal 2004, the
remaining Class C shares held by GS Group were
converted into Class A common stock and sold in a secondary
stock offering. There is no longer any Class C common stock
outstanding. The holders of Class A common stock generally
have rights identical to holders of Class B common stock
except that holders of Class A common stock are entitled to
one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are
entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of all classes of common
stock entitled to vote will vote together as a single class on
all matters presented to the stockholders for their vote or
approval except for the election and the removal of directors
and as otherwise required by applicable law.

As of May 21, 2004, there were 1,174 holders
of record of our Class A common stock and four holders of
record of our Class B common stock.

Stock Incentive Plans

On June 9, 1997, our Board of Directors
adopted the 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (Stock Incentive
Plan). The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of awards
to any officer or other employee, consultant to, or director
with respect to a maximum of 10.0 million shares of our
Class A common stock (“Shares”), subject to
adjustment to avoid dilution or enlargement of intended benefits
in the event of certain significant corporate events, which
awards may be made in the form of: (i) nonqualified stock
options; (ii) stock options intended to qualify as
incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code; (iii) stock appreciation rights;
(iv) restricted stock and/or restricted stock units;
(v) performance awards; and (vi) other stock-based
awards. On June 13, 2000, our Board of Directors increased
the maximum number of Shares that can be granted under the Stock
Incentive Plan to 20.0 million Shares, which was approved
by the stockholders on August 17, 2000. At April 3,
2004, we had approximately 4.7 million Shares reserved for
issuance under this plan.

On June 9, 1997, our Board of Directors
adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors
(Non-Employee Directors Plan). Under the Non-Employee Directors
Plan, grants of options to purchase up to 500,000 Shares
may be granted to non-employee directors. In Fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002 our Board of Directors granted options to
purchase 22,500, 18,000, and 27,000 Shares with
exercise prices equal to the stock’s fair market value on
the date of grant. At April 3, 2004, we had approximately
362,000 shares reserved for issuance under this plan.

Stock options were granted under the plans with
an exercise price equal to the stock’s fair market value on
the date of grant. These options vest in equal installments
primarily over two years for officers and other key employees
and over three years for all remaining employees and
non-employee directors. The options expire 10 years from
the date of grant. Stock option activity for the Stock Incentive
Plan and Non-Employee Directors Plan in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002 was as follows (Shares in thousands):

F-32


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Additional information relating to options
outstanding as of April 3, 2004, was as follows (Shares in
thousands):

In June 2003, a grant of 100,000 restricted stock
units was made under our Stock Incentive Plan, and a total of
541 restricted stock units were granted during Fiscal 2004 in
respect of the initial grant in connection with the payment of
quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. An additional
100,000 restricted stock units will be granted on each
anniversary of the first grant date pursuant to an employment
agreement with an initial term ending on the last day of Fiscal
2008, and additional units (the “dividend units”) will
be granted in respect of the then outstanding restricted stock
units in connection with each cash dividend paid on our common
stock. The restricted stock units vest on the fifth anniversary
of the grant date (with the dividend units vesting with the
underlying restricted stock units in respect of which they are
granted) and will be payable solely in shares of common stock
following termination of employment. The vesting of all then
outstanding unvested restricted stock units will be accelerated
if termination of employment occurs after the last day of Fiscal
2008, except in the case of termination by the company for
cause. The unearned compensation in respect of the grants made
during the initial term is being amortized over the period
ending on that date.

In July 2002, 300,000 Shares of restricted
stock were granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. These shares
are subject to restrictions on transfer and the risk of
forfeiture until earned, and vest as follows: 20% on each of the
first five anniversaries of the grant date. The unearned
compensation is being amortized over a period equal to the
anticipated vesting.

In April 2000, 118,299 Shares of restricted
stock were granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. These shares
are subject to restrictions on transfer and the risk of
forfeiture until earned, and vest as follows: 25% each on the
second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
The unearned compensation is being amortized over a period equal
to the anticipated vesting.

In March 1998, our Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to
$100.0 million of our Shares. Share repurchases were made
in the open market over the two-year period which commenced
April 1, 1998. The Board of Directors has authorized the
extension of the stock repurchase program through April 1,
2006. Shares acquired under the repurchase program will be used
for stock option programs and for other corporate purposes. The
repurchased shares have been accounted for as treasury stock at
cost. As of April 3, 2004, we had repurchased
4,087,906 Shares at an aggregate cost of
$77.5 million. No shares were repurchased under the stock
repurchase program during Fiscal 2004. Certain employees
tendered stock in satisfaction of federal and state withholding
taxes incurred due to the vesting of shares granted under our
stock incentive plan. These transactions are treated as stock
repurchases and amounted to approximately $1.0 million in
Fiscal 2004.

Employee Benefits

Profit Sharing Retirement Savings
    Plans

We sponsor two defined contribution benefit plans
covering substantially all eligible United States employees not
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include
a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. We make discretionary contributions to the plans
and contribute an amount equal to 50% of the first 6% of an
employee’s contribution.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is
100% vested in our matching and discretionary contributions
after five years of credited service. Contributions under these
plans approximated $3.8 million, $3.1 million and
$6.0 million in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Supplemental Retirement Plan

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental
retirement plan for certain highly compensated employees whose
benefits under the 401(k) profit sharing retirement savings
plans are expected to be constrained by the operation of certain
Internal Revenue Code limitations. These supplemental benefits
vest over time and the compensation expense related to these
benefits is recognized over the vesting period. The amounts
accrued under these plans were $17.5 million and
$16.0 million at April 3, 2004 and March 29,
2003, and are reflected in other noncurrent liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation
expense related to these benefits was $3.8 million,
$1.4 million and $2.9 million in Fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. This liability is partially funded through
whole-life policies, which had cash surrender values of
$12.5 million and $11.8 million at April 3, 2004
and March 29, 2003, and are reflected in other assets in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred Compensation

We have deferred compensation arrangements for
certain key executives which generally provide for payments upon
retirement, death or termination of employment. The amounts
accrued under these plans were $4.0 million and
$4.6 million at April 3, 2004, and March 29,
2003, and are reflected in other noncurrent liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation
expense related to these compensation arrangements was
$0.7 million each year for Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. We
fund a portion of these obligations through the establishment of
trust accounts on behalf of the executives participating in the
plans. The trust accounts are reflected in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Union Pension

We participate in a multi-employer pension plan
and are required to make contributions to the Union of
Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees
(“Union”) for dues based on wages paid to union
employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to
a retirement fund which provides defined benefits to
substantially all unionized workers. We do not participate in
the management of the plan and have not been furnished with
information with respect to the type of benefits provided,
vested and nonvested benefits or assets.

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or
termination of a multi-employer plan, is required to continue
funding its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded
vested benefits. Such withdrawal liability was assumed in
conjunction with the acquisition of certain assets from a
non-affiliated licensee. We have no current intention of
withdrawing from the plan.

Segment Reporting

The Company operates in three business segments:
wholesale, retail and licensing. Our reportable segments are
individual business units that either offer different products
and services, or are managed separately since each segment
requires different strategic initiatives, promotional campaigns,
marketing and advertising, based upon its own individual
positioning in the market. Additionally, these segments reflect
the reporting basis used internally by senior management to
evaluate performance and the allocation of resources.

Our wholesale segment consists of three operating
units: Polo Brands, Lauren, and Collection Brands. Each unit
designs, sources, markets and distributes discrete brands. Each
of the units primarily sell products to major department and
specialty stores and to our owned and licensed retail stores.

The retail segment operates two types of stores:
outlet and full-price stores. The stores sell our products
purchased from our licensees, our suppliers and our wholesale
segment.

The licensing segment, which consists of product,
international and home, generates revenues from royalties
through its licensing alliances. The licensing agreements grant
the licensee rights to use our various trademarks in connection
with the manufacture and sale of designated products in
specified geographical areas.

The accounting policies of the segments are
consistent with those described in Note 1. Intersegment
sales and transfers are recorded at cost and treated as a
transfer of inventory. All intercompany revenues and profits or
losses are eliminated in consolidation. We do not review these
sales when evaluating segment performance. We evaluate each
segment’s performance based upon income or loss from
operations before interest, foreign currency gains and losses,
restructuring charges and income taxes. Corporate overhead
expenses are allocated to each segment based upon each
segment’s usage of corporate resources. The restructuring
charges were allocated as follows: $6.7 million to
wholesale and $12.9 million to retail in Fiscal 2004,
$12.3 million to wholesale and $2.1 million to retail
in Fiscal 2003 and $16.0 million to retail in Fiscal 2002.

Our net revenues, income from operations,
depreciation and amortization expense and capital expenditures
for Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, and total assets as of
April 3, 2004, March 29, 2003 and March 30, 2002,

Legal Proceedings

As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel
Group, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, “Jones”) to
meet the minimum sales volumes for the year ended
December 31, 2002 under the license agreements for the sale
of products under the “Ralph” trademark between us and
Jones dated May 11, 1998, these license agreements
terminated as of December 31, 2003. We advised Jones that
the termination of these license agreements would automatically
result in the termination of the license agreements between us
and Jones with respect to the “Lauren” trademark
pursuant to the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement
between the Company and Jones dated May 11, 1998. The terms
of the Lauren license agreements would otherwise have expired on
December 31, 2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit
against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York
alleging, among other things, that we had breached the Lauren
license agreements by asserting our rights pursuant to the Cross
Default and Term Extension Agreement, and that we induced
Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the former President of Jones, to
breach the non-compete and confidentiality clauses in
Ms. Nemerov’s employment agreement with Jones. Jones
stated that it would treat the Lauren license agreements as
terminated as of December 31, 2003, and is

F-37

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

seeking compensatory damages of
$550.0 million, punitive damages and enforcement of
Ms. Nemerov’s agreement. Also on June 3, 2003, we
filed a lawsuit against Jones in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York seeking, among other things, an injunction and a
declaratory judgment that the Lauren license agreements would
terminate as of December 31, 2003 pursuant to the terms of
the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement. The two lawsuits
were consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims regarding breach of the
“Lauren” agreements and a motion to stay the claims
regarding Ms. Nemerov pending the arbitration of
Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On July 23,
2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgment in our action
against Jones, and on August 12, 2003, we filed a
cross-motion for summary judgment. Oral argument on the motions
was heard on September 30, 2003. On March 18, 2004,
the Court entered orders (i) denying our motion to dismiss
Jones’ claims against us for breach of the Lauren
agreements and (ii) granted Jones’ motion for summary
judgement in our action for declaratory judgement the Lauren
agreements terminated on December 31, 2003 and dismissed
our complaint. The order also stayed Jones’ claim against
us relating to Ms. Nemerov pending arbitration regarding
her alleged breach of her employment agreement. On
April 16, 2004, we moved the court to reconsider its
orders, and a hearing on our motion was held on May 19,
2004. The Court has not yet issued a ruling as a result of this
hearing. We have also filed notices of appeal of the orders. If
Jones’ lawsuit were to be determined adversely to us, it
could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. However, we intend to
continue to defend the case vigorously and believe our position
is correct on the merits.

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of
the Company’s stores filed a lawsuit against Polo Retail,
LLC and the Company in the United States District Court for the
District of Northern California alleging violations of
California antitrust and labor laws. The plaintiff purports to
represent a class of employees who have allegedly been injured
by a requirement that certain retail employees purchase and wear
Company apparel as a condition of their employment. The
complaint, as amended, seeks an unspecified amount of actual and
punitive damages, disgorgement of profits and injunctive and
declaratory relief. The Company answered the amended complaint
on November 4, 2002. A hearing on cross-motions for summary
judgement on the issue of whether the Company’s policies
violated California law took place on August 14, 2003. The
Court granted partial summary judgement with respect to certain
of the plaintiff’s claims, but concluded that more
discovery was necessary before it could decide the key issue as
to whether the Company had maintained for a period of time a
dress code policy that violated California law. The Court
ordered the parties to conduct limited discovery to that end.
Discovery has been stayed pending the outcome of mediation
between the parties, which will commence on May 12, 2004.

On April 14, 2003, a second putative class
action was filed in the San Francisco Superior Court. This
suit, brought by the same attorneys, alleges near identical
claims to those in the federal class action. The class
representatives consist of former employees and the plaintiff in
the federal court action. Defendants in this class action
include the Company, Polo Retail, LLC, Fashions Outlet of
America, Inc., Polo Retail, Inc., San Francisco Polo, Ltd.
as well as a non-Polo corporate defendant and two current
managers. As in the federal action, the complaint seeks an
unspecified amount of action and punitive, restitution of monies
spent, and declaratory relief. The state class action has been
stayed pending resolution of the federal class action.

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit
against the United States Polo Association Inc., Jordache, Ltd.
and certain other entities affiliated with them, alleging that
the defendants were

infringing on our famous trademarks. This lawsuit
continues to proceed as both sides are awaiting the court’s
decision on various motions. In connection with this lawsuit, on
July 19, 2001, the United States Polo Association and
Jordache filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. This suit,
which is effectively a counterclaim by them in connection with
the original trademark action, asserts claims related to our
actions in connection with our pursuit of claims against the
United States Polo Association and Jordache for trademark
infringement and other unlawful conduct. Their claims stem from
our contacts with the United States Polo Association’s and
Jordache’s retailers in which we informed these retailers
of our position in the original trademark action. All claims and
counterclaims have been settled, except for the Company’s
claims that the defendants violated the Company’s trademark
rights. We did not pay any damages in this settlement.

On December 5, 2003, United States Polo
Association, USPA Properties, Inc., Global Licensing Sverige and
Atlas Design AB (collectively, “USPA”) filed a Demand
for Arbitration against the Company in Sweden under the auspices
of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution seeking a
declaratory judgement that USPA’s so-called Horseman symbol
does not infringe on Polo Ralph Lauren’s trademark and
other rights. No claim for damages is stated. On
February 19, 2004, we answered the Demand for Arbitration,
contesting the arbitrability of USPA’s claim for
declaratory relief. We also asserted our own counterclaim,
seeking a judgement that the USPA’s Horseman symbol
infringes on our trademark and other rights. We also seek
injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. On
March 5, 2004, USPA answered our counterclaim, denying the
allegations set forth therein. A hearing has been set in this
matter for June 29, June 30, July 1,
August 28 and August 29. We will continue to contest
the arbitrability of USPA’s claim for declaratory relief
and continue vigorously to pursue our counterclaim and contest
the claim lodged against us by USPA.

In December, 2003 we received a demand on behalf
of a stockholder to inspect the Company’s books and records
relating to the amended and restated employment agreement dated
June 23, 2003 between the Company and Ralph Lauren. The
demand asserts that the purpose of the inspection is to
determine, among other things, whether the directors of the
Company breached their fiduciary duties in approving the
compensation provided for in the employment agreement. While we
have provided certain information, we believe that the issues
asserted by the demand are without merit.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in
legal claims involving trademark and intellectual property,
licensing, employee relations and other matters incidental to
our business. We believe that the resolution of these other
matters currently pending will not, individually or in
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

accrued expenses of the Childrenswear Licensee
and accrued vacation obligations for the Childrenswear
Licensee’s employees who will become employees of the
Company following the closing of the acquisition. The assets of
the Childrenswear Licensee being acquired by the Company
include, among other things, the license; all inventories of the
Childrenswear Licensee; certain leases; customer lists; supplier
lists; and books and records.

The Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its
affiliates and shareholders have agreed to indemnify the Company
for all of the liabilities of the Company related to the
operation of the Childrenswear Business prior to the closing of
the acquisition and have also agreed that they will not compete
with the Childrenswear Business for a period of three years
after the closing date. In addition, the Childrenswear Licensee
and certain of its affiliates will provide information system
and accounting services to the Company for a transitional period
following the closing.

The closing of the proposed transaction is
subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of
certain third party consents and the expiration or termination
of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The closing of the
transaction is anticipated to occur in late June 2004.
