PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, founded in 1967 by Ralph Lauren,
    is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of
    premium lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s
    and children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. We believe that our global reach, breadth of
    product and multi-channel distribution is unique among luxury
    and apparel companies. We operate in three distinct but
    integrated segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. During the
    past several years, we have continued to develop our business
    model, expand our vertically integrated Retail segment,
    reposition our Wholesale segment, and maintain a strong
    Licensing segment despite the strategic acquisition of several
    of our key licensed businesses. The following tables show our
    net revenues and operating profit (excluding unallocated
    corporate expenses and legal and restructuring charges) by
    segment for the last three fiscal years:

Over the past five fiscal years, our sales have grown to
    $4.880 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $2.650 billion in
    Fiscal 2004. This growth has been largely a result of both our
    acquisitions and organic growth. We have diversified our
    business by channels of distribution, price point and target
    consumer, as well as by geography. Our global reach is one of
    the broadest in the apparel industry, with merchandise available
    at approximately 10,800 different retail locations worldwide. In
    addition to our wholesale distribution, we sell directly to
    customers throughout the world via 313 full-price and factory
    retail stores and our

e-commerce

website, RalphLauren.com.

We continue to invest in our business. In the past five fiscal
    years, we have invested approximately $1.9 billion for the
    acquisition of several key licensed businesses and capital
    improvements, primarily through strong operating cash flow. In
    addition, during Fiscal 2008 we launched

American Living

,
    a new lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for
    distribution by J.C. Penney Company, Inc.
    (“JCPenney”). We intend to continue to execute our
    long-term strategy of expanding our accessories and other
    product offerings, growing our specialty retail store base, and
    expanding our presence internationally. See
    Item 7 —

“Overview — Our
    Objectives and Risks”

for further discussion of the
    Company’s long-term strategy.

We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding
    of our Company. As of March 29, 2008, Mr. Ralph
    Lauren, or entities controlled by Mr. Ralph Lauren, owned
    approximately 87% of the voting power of the outstanding common
    stock of the Company.

Seasonality
    of Business

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with greater
    Wholesale segment sales in our second and fourth quarters and
    greater Retail segment sales in our second and third quarters.
    These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal
    wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back-to-school and
    holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment. As a result of
    the growth in our retail operations and other changes in our
    business, historical quarterly operating trends and working
    capital requirements may not be indicative of future
    performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating
    income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by, among other
    things, the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other
    events affecting retail sales.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working
    capital increases during the first half of the fiscal year as
    inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and,
    accordingly, decreases during the second half of the fiscal year
    as inventory is shipped. Cash provided by operating activities
    is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to
    higher net income and reduced working capital requirements
    during that period.

Recent
    Developments

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company completed its previously
    announced transactions to acquire control of certain of its
    Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed
    arrangements, consistent with the Company’s long-term
    strategy of international expansion. In particular, the Company
    acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares of Impact
    21 Co., Ltd. (“Impact 21”) that it did not previously
    own in a cash tender offer (the “Impact 21
    Acquisition”), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact
    21 from approximately 20% to



approximately 97%. Impact 21 conducts the Company’s
    men’s, women’s and jeans apparel and accessories
    business in Japan under a pre-existing, sub-license arrangement.
    In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in
    Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (“PRL Japan”),
    which holds the master license to conduct Polo’s business
    in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu (the “PRL Japan
    Minority Interest Acquisition”). Collectively, the Impact
    21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition
    are herein referred to as the “Japanese Business
    Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately
    $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately
    $12 million. In January 2008, at an Impact
    21 shareholders meeting, the Company obtained the necessary
    approvals to complete the process of acquiring the remaining
    approximately 3% of outstanding shares not exchanged as of the
    close of the tender offer period (the “minority
    squeeze-out”). In February 2008, the Company acquired
    approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares
    outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. The Company
    expects the minority squeeze-out to be successfully concluded in
    the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, at an estimated aggregate cost
    of $9 million.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and ¥20.5 billion of borrowings
    under a one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment
    and restatement to the Company’s existing credit facility.
    The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on
    May 22, 2008 using approximately $200 million of
    Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as part of the
    acquisition.

The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    within minority interest expense the amount of Impact 21’s
    net income allocable to the holders of the approximate 80% of
    the Impact 21 shares not owned by the Company prior to the
    closing date of the tender offer. The results of operations for
    PRL Japan have already been consolidated by the Company as
    described further in Note 2 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements.

American
    Living

In Fiscal 2008, the Company launched

American Living

, a
    new lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for
    distribution by JCPenney through the Company’s new Global
    Brand Concepts (“GBC”) group. The Company began
    shipping related product to JCPenney in December 2007 to support
    the launch of this new product line. The success of

American
    Living

and the introduction of new product categories in
    both the U.S. and overseas may be negatively impacted in
    Fiscal 2009 by ongoing economic uncertainty. See
    Item 7 —

“Overview — Global
    Economic Uncertainty”

for further discussion.

Other
    Developments

In late Fiscal 2007, the Company formed the Ralph Lauren Watch
    and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL Watch
    Company”), a joint venture with Financiere Richemont SA
    (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group. The
    Company began to incur certain

start-up

costs in Fiscal 2008 to support the launch of this business,
    which is expected to occur in the spring of calendar 2009.

Our

Our
    Wholesale Segment

Our Wholesale segment sells our products to leading upscale and
    certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores and golf
    and pro shops, both domestically and internationally. We have
    focused on elevating our brand and improving productivity by
    reducing the number of unproductive doors within department
    stores in which our products are sold, improving in-store
    product assortment and presentation, and improving full-price
    sell-throughs to consumers. As of March 29, 2008, the end
    of Fiscal 2008, our products were sold through 10,806 doors
    worldwide, and during Fiscal 2008, we invested approximately
    $49 million in shop-within-shops dedicated to our products
    primarily in domestic and international department stores. We
    have also effected selective price increases on basic products
    and introduced new fashion offerings at higher price points.

Department stores are our major wholesale customers in North
    America. In Europe, our wholesale sales are a varying mix of
    sales to both department stores and specialty shops, depending
    on the country. Our collection brands — Women’s
    Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label and Men’s Purple
    Label Collection and Black Label — are distributed
    through a limited number of premier fashion retailers. In
    addition, we sell excess and out-of-season products through
    secondary distribution channels, including our retail factory
    stores.

In Japan, our products are distributed primarily through
    shop-within-shops at premiere department stores. The mix of
    business is weighted to Polo Ralph Lauren in Men’s and
    Women’s Blue Label. The distribution of Men’s and
    Women’s Black Label is also expanding through

shop-within-shop

presentations in top tier department stores across Japan.

Worldwide
    Distribution Channels

The following table presents the approximate number of doors by

The following department store chains were wholesale customers
    whose purchases represented more than 10% of our worldwide
    wholesale net sales for the year ended March 29, 2008:

•

Macy’s, Inc. (formerly known as Federated Department
    Stores, Inc.), which represented approximately 24%; and

•

Dillard Department Stores, Inc., which represented approximately
    12%.

Our product brands are sold primarily through their own sales
    forces. Our Wholesale segment maintains their primary showrooms
    in New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in
    Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, London,
    Munich, Madrid and Stockholm.



Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical
    element of our distribution to department stores, we and our
    licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand
    recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines
    by the department stores and to differentiate the presentation
    of products. Shop-within-shops fixed assets primarily include
    items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and
    components, decorative items and flooring.

As of March 29, 2008, we had approximately 10,800
    shop-within-shops dedicated to our wholesale products worldwide
    and our licensing partners had over 460 shop-within-shops.
    During Fiscal 2008, we added approximately 500
    shop-within-shops, net. Excluding significantly larger
    shop-within-shops in key department store locations, the size of
    our shop-within-shops typically ranges from approximately 200 to
    6,000 square feet. We share in the cost of these
    shop-within-shops.

Basic Stock Replenishment
    Program.

Basic products such as knit shirts,
    chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered at any time
    through our basic stock replenishment programs. We generally
    ship these products within three-to-five days of order receipt.
    These products accounted for approximately 6% of our wholesale
    net sales in Fiscal 2008.

Our
    Retail Segment

As of March 29, 2008, our Retail segment consisted of 155
    full-price retail stores and 158 factory stores worldwide,
    totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet. The
    expansion of our full-price retail store base is a primary
    long-term strategic goal. We opened 8 new full-price stores,
    net, in Fiscal 2008 and currently anticipate opening between 10
    and 15 full-price stores in Fiscal 2009. Our retail operating
    income as a percentage of retail net revenues increased from
    4.8% in Fiscal 2004 to 10.7% in Fiscal 2008, reflecting
    improvements in productivity, gross margins, and full-margin
    sell-through rates. Our full-price retail stores reinforce the
    luxury image and distinct sensibility of our brands and feature
    exclusive lines that are not sold in domestic department stores:
    Blue Label for Women and Black Label for Men. We operated the
    following full-price retail stores as of March 29, 2008:

    approximately 290,000 new customers, resulting in
    1.3 million total customers in Fiscal 2008. RalphLauren.com
    is owned and operated by Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (“RL
    Media”). We acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in
    RL Media, formerly held by NBC-Lauren Media Holdings, Inc., a
    subsidiary wholly owned by the National Broadcasting Company,
    Inc. (37.5%) and Value Vision Media, Inc. (“Value
    Vision”) (12.5%) (the “RL Media Minority Interest
    Acquisition”), in late Fiscal 2007.

Our
    Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight,
    design, and marketing skills with the specific product or
    geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and
    build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners
    who:

•

are leaders in their respective markets;

•

contribute the majority of the product development costs;

•

provide the operational infrastructure required to support the
    business; and

•

own the inventory.

We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell
    at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more
    of our trademarks. We grant our international geographic area
    licensing partners exclusive rights to distribute certain brands
    or classes of our products and operate retail stores in specific
    international territories. These geographic area licensees
    source products from us, our product licensing partners and
    independent sources. Each licensing partner pays us royalties
    based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a
    minimum royalty requirement for the right to use the
    Company’s trademarks and design services. In addition,
    licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of
    their revenues to advertise our products and share in the
    creative costs associated



with these products. Larger allocations are required in
    connection with launches of new products or in new territories.
    Our licenses generally have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that their
    products are developed, marketed and distributed so as to reach
    the intended market opportunity and to present consistently to
    consumers worldwide the distinctive perspective and lifestyle
    associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design,
    production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution,
    advertising and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject
    to our prior approval and continuing oversight. The result is a
    consistent identity for Ralph Lauren products across product
    categories and international markets.

Approximately 16% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2008 was
    derived from two product licensing partners: WestPoint Home,
    Inc. (8%) and Peerless, Inc. (8%).

distribute various categories of our products in a given

    those of our product licensing partners. We design licensed
    products either alone or in collaboration with our domestic
    licensing partners. Our product licensees whose territories do
    not include the international geographic area licensees’
    territories generally provide our international licensing
    partners with product or patterns, piece goods, manufacturing
    locations and other information and assistance necessary to
    achieve product uniformity, for which they are often compensated.

We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home
    licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners.

    partners manufacture and own the inventory, and ship the
    products. Our Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances generally
    have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the upper tiers of
    their respective markets and are offered at a range of price
    levels. These products are generally distributed through several
    channels of distribution, including department stores, specialty
    home furnishings stores, interior design showrooms, customer
    direct mail catalogs, home centers and the Internet, as well as
    our own stores. As with our other products, the use of

Product
    Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of
    American style with a strong international appeal. Our
    consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an
    important contributor to the prominence, strength and reputation
    of the Ralph Lauren brands.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the
    direction of, Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which is
    divided into nine departments: Menswear, Women’s
    Collection, Women’s Ready to Wear, Dresses,
    Children’s, Accessories, Home, Club Monaco and Rugby. We
    form design teams around our brands and product categories to
    develop concepts, themes and products for each brand and
    category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales
    and production staff, these teams support all three segments of
    our business — Wholesale, Retail and
    Licensing — in order to gain market and other valuable
    input.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing program communicates the themes and images of our
    brands and is an integral feature of our product offering.
    Worldwide marketing is managed on a centralized basis through
    our advertising and public relations departments in order to
    ensure consistency of presentation.

We create distinctive image advertising for all of our products,
    conveying the particular message of each brand within the
    context of our core themes. Advertisements generally portray a
    lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of
    products offered by ourselves and, in some cases, our licensing
    partners. Our primary advertising medium is print, with multiple
    page advertisements appearing regularly in a range of fashion,
    lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major print
    advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and spring
    retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to coincide
    with product deliveries. In addition to print, some product
    categories have utilized television and outdoor media in their
    marketing programs for certain product categories. Our
    RalphLauren.com

e-commerce

website presents the Ralph Lauren lifestyle on the Internet
    while offering the full breadth of our apparel, accessories and
    home products.



We advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate
    in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major
    retailers. In addition, we provide point-of-sale fixtures and
    signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation
    of our products at retail locations. We expensed approximately
    $188 million related to the advertising of our products in
    Fiscal 2008, an increase of approximately 4% from Fiscal 2007.

If our domestic licensing partners are required to spend an
    amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on
    advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their
    behalf.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each
    of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at
    major fashion shows in New York City, which typically generate
    extensive domestic and international media coverage. We
    introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at
    major fashion shows in cities such as New York or Milan, Italy.
    In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our models,
    certain professional golfers and sponsors. We are the first
    exclusive outfitter for all on-court officials at the Wimbledon
    tennis tournament. We are also the official outfitter of all
    on-court officials at the U.S. Open tennis tournament.

In May 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with the
    U.S. Olympic Committee designating Polo Ralph Lauren as an
    Official Outfitter of the 2008 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic
    Teams. Under this agreement, the Company will be designing the
    official Opening Ceremony and Closing Ceremony Parade Outfits
    for the U.S. Olympic Teams members, in addition to an
    assortment of village wear pieces to be provided to the athletes
    on the U.S. Teams. Products will be available for sale in
    the U.S. in June 2008 in Polo Ralph Lauren retail stores,
    select department stores, and RalphLauren.com, with select items
    available on the U.S. Olympic Committee website.

Sourcing,
    Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own
    or operate any production facilities. Over 400 different
    manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear and
    accessories products. We source both finished products and raw
    materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons and other trim.
    Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled
    products ready for shipment to our customers. In Fiscal 2008,
    less than 2%, by dollar volume, of our products were produced in
    the U.S., and over 98%, by dollar volume, were produced outside
    the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. See

“Import Restrictions and other Government
    Regulations”

and Part 1A —

“Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.”

Two manufacturers engaged by us accounted for approximately 12%
    and 8% of our total production during Fiscal 2008. The primary
    production facilities of these two manufacturers are located in
    China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Philippines and Sri Lanka.

Our Wholesale segment must commit to manufacture the majority of
    our garments before we receive customer orders. We also must
    commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance of our
    sales. If we overestimate our primary customers’ demand for
    a particular product, we may sell the excess in our factory
    stores or sell the product through secondary distribution
    channels. If we overestimate the need for a particular fabric or
    yarn, that fabric or yarn may be used in garments made for
    subsequent seasons or made into past seasons’ styles for
    distribution in our factory stores.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global
    manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia,
    the Americas and Europe. All garments are produced according to
    our specifications. Production and quality control staff in the
    Americas, Asia and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier
    facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the
    final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor
    certification and compliance programs, so that quality assurance
    is focused upon as early as possible in the production process,
    allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution
    facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.

Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and
    consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with
    numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic and foreign.
    Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have



substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on
    the basis of fashion, quality and service, which depend on our
    ability to:

•

anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely
    manner;

•

maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

develop and produce high quality products that appeal to
    consumers;

•

appropriately price our products;

•

provide strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensure product availability; and

•

obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present our
    products at retail.

See Item 1A —

“We face intense
    competition in the worldwide apparel industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution domestically, Ralph Lauren men’s
    and women’s products are shipped from manufacturers
    primarily to our distribution center in Greensboro, North
    Carolina for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment to retail
    customers. Ralph Lauren Childrenswear products are shipped from
    our manufacturers to a leased distribution center in
    Martinsburg, West Virginia. In addition, we utilize third party
    logistics providers to manage selected programs for specific
    customers. These facilities are designed to allow for high
    density cube storage and utilize bar code technology to provide
    inventory management and carton controls. Product traffic
    management is also coordinated from these facilities. European
    distribution and warehousing has been largely consolidated into
    one third party facility located in Parma, Italy. Japan
    logistics have been consolidated into one third party facility
    in Kawaski.

Our full-price store and factory store distribution and
    warehousing are principally handled through the Greensboro
    distribution center. Club Monaco products are distributed from
    facilities in Ontario, Canada, Greensboro, North Carolina and
    California.

RalphLauren.com customer contact functions and order fulfillment
    are performed at a new 360,000 sq. ft. leased facility
    in High Point, North Carolina. The facility opened and commenced
    customer contact operations in November 2007, and commenced
    fulfillment operations in February 2008.

Management
    Information Systems

Our management information systems make the marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution of our products more
    efficient by providing, among other things:

•

comprehensive order processing;

•

production information;

•

accounting information; and

•

an enterprise view of information for our marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution functions.

The point-of-sale registers in conjunction with other systems in
    our stores enable us to track inventory from store receipt to
    final sale on a real-time basis. We believe our merchandising
    and financial systems, coupled with our point-of-sale registers
    and software programs, allow for rapid stock replenishment,
    concise merchandise planning and real-time inventory accounting.
    See Item 1A —

“Certain legal proceedings
    and regulatory matters could adversely impact our results of
    operations.”

We also utilize a sophisticated automated replenishment system,
    Logility, to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment
    orders from our Retail segment and wholesale customers, the
    movement of goods through distribution channels, and the
    collection of information for planning and forecasting. We have
    a collaborative relationship with many of our suppliers that
    enables us to reduce cash-to-cash cycles in the management of
    our inventory. We are implementing a



new, global enterprise resource management system for our
    Wholesale segment. See Item 1A —

“Our
    business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are
    disrupted or cease to operate effectively.”

Wholesale
    Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise
    primarily to major department stores and extend credit based on
    an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels
    and the financial condition of our customers on a continuing
    basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor our accounts
    receivables or maintain credit insurance to manage the risks of
    bad debts. Our bad debt write-offs were $1.6 million in
    Fiscal 2008, representing less than 1 percent of net
    revenues. See Item 1A —

“Our business
    could be negatively impacted by any financial instability of our
    customers.”

Wholesale
    Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products
    approximately three to five months prior to the time the
    products are delivered to stores. Such orders are generally
    subject to broad cancellation rights. As of March 29, 2008,
    our total backlog was $1.573 billion, compared to
    $1.396 billion as of March 31, 2007. We expect that
    substantially all of our backlog orders as of March 29,
    2008 will be filled within the next fiscal year. Our backlog
    depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the
    market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant
    percentage of our orders are received, and the timing of
    shipments. As a consequence, a comparison of backlog from period
    to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be
    indicative of eventual shipments.

Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph Lauren” and the
    famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the
    U.S. and approximately 100 countries worldwide. Other
    trademarks that we similarly own include:

•

“Lauren/Ralph Lauren”;

•

“Ralph”;

•

“RRL”;

•

“Club Monaco”;

•

“Rugby”;

•

“RLX”;

•

“Chaps”;

•

“American Living”; and

•

Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.

Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as
    trademarks “Ralph Lauren,” “Double RL” and
    “RRL” in perpetuity in connection with, among other
    things, beef and living animals. The trademarks “Double
    RL” and “RRL” are currently used by the Double RL
    Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. In addition,
    Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects
    involving film or theatrical productions (not including or
    relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a
    company wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these
    companies has no impact on us.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations and pending
    applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items
    of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings and
    beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services,
    and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration
    of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and
    enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the
    related products and services and the required registration
    renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks
    and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as
    extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a
    worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against
    infringement (see Item 3 —

“Legal
    Proceedings”

for further discussion). As a result of
    the appeal of



our trademarks, our products have been the object of
    counterfeiting. We have a broad enforcement program which has
    been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit
    products in the U.S. and in major markets abroad.

In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our
    trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our
    international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with
    various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in
    certain trademarks, including “Polo”

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, which would
    impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks.
    While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to
    time as we continue our international expansion, we have
    generally successfully resolved such conflicts in the past
    through both legal action and negotiated settlements with
    third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see
    Item 1A —

“Our trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected
    outside the U.S.”

and Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion).
    Although we have not in the past suffered any material
    restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable
    markets, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not
    arise in the future as we expand product offerings and
    additional trademarks to new markets.

We currently have an agreement with a third party which owned
    conflicting registrations of the trademarks “Polo” and
    a polo player astride a horse in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong
    and South Africa. Under the agreement, the third party retains
    the right to use the “Polo” and polo player symbol
    marks in South Africa and all other countries that comprise
    Sub-Saharan Africa, and we agreed to restrict use of those Polo
    marks in those countries to fragrances and cosmetics solely as
    part of the composite trademark “Ralph Lauren” and the
    polo player symbol, as to which our use is unlimited, and to the
    use of the polo player symbol mark on women’s and
    girls’ apparel and accessories and women’s and
    girls’ handkerchiefs. By agreeing to those restrictions, we
    secured the unlimited right to use our trademarks in the United
    Kingdom and Hong Kong without payment of any kind, and the third
    party is prohibited from distributing products under those
    trademarks in those countries.

Import
    Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the U.S., Canada,
    and Europe is subject to duties. Until January 1, 2005, our
    apparel merchandise was also subject to quotas. Quotas represent
    the right, pursuant to bilateral or other international trade
    arrangements, to export amounts of certain categories of
    merchandise into a country or territory pursuant to a visa or
    license. Pursuant to the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,
    quotas on textile and apparel products were eliminated for World
    Trade Organization (“WTO”) member countries, including
    the U.S., Canada and European countries, on January 1,
    2005. Notwithstanding quota elimination, China’s accession
    agreement for membership in the WTO provides that WTO member
    countries (including the U.S., Canada and European countries)
    may reimpose quotas on specific categories of products in the
    event it is determined that imports from China have surged and
    are threatening to create a market disruption for such
    categories of products (so called “safeguard quota
    provisions”). In response to surging imports, in November
    2005 the U.S. and China agreed to a new quota arrangement
    which will impose quotas on certain textile products through the
    end of calendar 2008. In addition, effective January 1,
    2008, the European Union also agreed with China on a new textile
    arrangement which imposed a double surveillance licensing scheme
    which is due to terminate at the end of calendar year 2008. The
    U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose
    additional duties in response to a particular product being
    imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded
    prices that in such increased quantities as to cause (or
    threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally
    known as “anti-dumping” actions). The European Union
    has imposed anti-dumping duties on imports from China and
    Vietnam in certain footwear categories. On January 11,
    2007, the Bush Administration imposed a Vietnam Import
    Monitoring Program on five broad product groups —
    shirts, trousers, sweaters, underwear, and swimwear —
    to determine whether any of those imports might be unfairly
    traded, due to dumping. The review period will last for the
    remainder of the Bush Administration with six-month reviews of
    data collected. If dumping is suspected, the
    U.S. Government will self-initiate a dumping case on behalf
    of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly
    affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally
    known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the
    U.S. Government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign
    government to foreign manufactures if the importation of such
    subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a
    U.S. industry. Recent developments have now made it
    possible to impose countervailing duties on products from
    non-market economies, such as China, which would significantly
    affect our costs.



We are also subject to other international trade agreements and
    regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,
    the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean
    Basin Initiative. In addition, each of the countries in which
    our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports.
    Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our
    products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time,
    impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls
    or restrictions, including the imposition of “safeguard
    quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates
    or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of
    import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our
    potential exposure to import related risks through, among other
    measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts
    of production among countries and manufacturers, as well as
    through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all our products are manufactured by foreign
    suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the
    administration of current international trade regulations,
    executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in
    sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quota could
    adversely affect our operations. Although we generally expect
    that the 2005 elimination of quotas will result, over the long
    term, in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced
    abroad, the implementation of any “safeguard quota
    provisions” or any “anti-dumping” or
    “countervailing duty” actions may result, over the
    near term, in cost increases for certain categories of products
    and in disruption of the supply chain for certain products
    categories. See Item 1A —

“Risk
    Factors”

below for further discussion.

Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to
    regulation in the U.S. and other countries by other
    governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade
    Commission, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer
    Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally
    to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability
    testing, and product safety particularly with respect to
    products used by children. We believe that we are in substantial
    compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable
    federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations
    governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the
    environment. We do not estimate any significant capital
    expenditures for environmental control matters either in the
    current year or in the near future. Our licensed products and
    licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our
    agreements require our licensing partners to operate in
    compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are not aware
    of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a
    material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Although we have not suffered any material inhibition from doing
    business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that
    significant impediments will not arise in the future as we
    expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to
    new markets.

Employees

As of March 29, 2008, we had approximately
    15,000 employees, both full and part-time, consisting of
    approximately 11,700 in the U.S. and approximately 3,300 in
    foreign countries. 36 of our U.S. production and
    distribution employees in the womenswear business are members of
    UNITE HERE (which was previously known as the Union of
    Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, prior to its
    merger with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
    International Union) under an industry association collective
    bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has
    adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and
    non-union employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
    The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking
    statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
    business, our prospects, our operating results, our financial
    condition, the trading prices of our securities and the actual
    outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are
    made in this report. Additional risks that we do not yet know of
    or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our
    business operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The loss
    of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or other key personnel
    could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing
    and operational areas of our business has been a critical
    element of our success since the inception of our Company. The
    death or disability of Mr. Lauren or other extended or
    permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or
    industry perception with respect to him or arising from his
    loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our
    other executive officers and other members of senior management
    have substantial experience and expertise in our business and
    have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
    The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these
    individuals could also adversely affect us. We are not protected
    by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance
    covering Mr. Lauren, our other executive officers and
    certain other members of senior management. We have entered into
    employment agreements with Mr. Lauren and our other
    executive officers, but the noncompete period with respect to
    Mr. Lauren and certain other executive officers could, in
    some circumstances in the event of their termination of
    employment with the Company, end prior to the employment term
    set forth in their employment agreements.

We cannot
    assure the successful implementation of our growth
    strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands,
    expand our geographic coverage and increase direct management of
    our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically
    acquiring or integrating select licenses previously held by our
    licensees and enhancing our operations. Implementation of our
    strategy involves the continued expansion of our business in
    Europe, Asia and other international areas. As discussed in
    Item 1 —

“Recent Developments,”

on May 29, 2007, we acquired a controlling interest in
    Impact 21, as part of the Tender Offer, and the remaining 50%
    interest in PRL Japan. We also acquired our previously licensed
    belts and leather goods business in April 2007 and the remaining
    50% interest in RL Media in March 2007. In Fiscal 2006, we
    acquired our previously licensed men’s and women’s
    casual apparel and sportswear in the U.S. and Canada from
    Jones Apparel Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Polo Jeans
    Business”). In addition, in Fiscal 2006, we acquired our
    previously licensed men’s, women’s and children’s
    footwear from Reebok International Ltd. (“Footwear
    Business”).

We may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our
    operations, hiring and retaining qualified key employees, or
    otherwise successfully managing such expansion. Furthermore, we
    may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any
    licensee that we acquire into our own business or achieve any
    expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.

In Fiscal 2008, we launched

American Living

, a new
    lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for
    JCPenney. The success of

American Living

and the
    introduction of new product categories in both the U.S. and
    overseas may be negatively impacted in Fiscal 2009 by ongoing
    economic uncertainty. See Item 7
    —

“Overview — Global Economic
    Uncertainty”

for further discussion.

Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation
    and expansion of our retail distribution network, both in the
    U.S. and abroad, which are subject to many factors beyond
    our control. We may not be able to procure, purchase or lease
    desirable free-standing or department store locations, or renew
    and maintain existing free-standing store leases and department
    store locations on acceptable terms, or secure suitable
    replacement locations. The lease negotiation as well as the
    number and timing of new stores actually opened during any given



period, and their associated contribution to net income for the
    period, depends on a number of factors including, but not
    limited, to: (i) the availability of suitable financing to
    us and our landlords; (ii) the timing of the delivery of
    the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to
    commence build-out construction activities; (iii) our
    ability and our landlords’ ability to obtain all necessary
    governmental licenses and permits to construct and operate our
    stores on a timely basis; (iv) our ability to manage the
    construction and development costs of new stores; (v) the
    rectification of any unforeseen engineering or environmental
    problems with the leased premises; (vi) adverse weather
    during the construction period; and (vii) the hiring and
    training of qualified operating personnel in the local market.
    While we continue to explore new markets and are always
    evaluating new potential, any of the above factors could have an
    adverse impact on our financial operations.

In Europe we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we
    have in the U.S., and we may have difficulty developing
    successful distribution strategies and alliances in each of the
    major European countries. In Japan, our primary mode of
    distribution is via a network of shops located within the
    leading department stores. We may have difficulty in
    successfully retaining this network, and expanding into
    alternate distribution channels. Additionally, macroeconomic
    trends may not be favorable, and could limit our ability to
    implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we
    have foreign operations, such as Europe and Asia.

Our
    business could suffer as a result of consolidations,
    restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail
    industry.

Several of our department store customers, including some under
    common ownership, account for significant portions of our
    wholesale net sales. We believe that a substantial portion of
    sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing
    partners, including sales made by our sales force of Ralph
    Lauren Home products, are also made to our largest department
    store customers. In Fiscal 2008, sales to Macy’s, Inc.
    represented approximately 24% of our wholesale net sales and
    sales to Dillard Department Stores, Inc. represented
    approximately 12% of our wholesale net sales. In the aggregate,
    our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 69% of our
    wholesale net sales during Fiscal 2008. There can be no
    assurance that consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations
    or other ownership changes in the department store sector will
    not have a material adverse effect on our wholesale business.

We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
    commitments with our customers for each of our lines every
    season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores
    or any other significant customer, whether motivated by
    competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
    decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from
    us or our licensing partners; to change their manner of doing
    business with us or our licensing partners; or their new
    strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued
    focus on further development of their “private label”
    initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business or financial condition. See Item 1 —

“Recent Developments”

for discussion of launch
    of

American Living

.

Our
    business could be negatively impacted by any financial
    instability of our customers.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department
    stores across the U.S. and Europe and extend credit based
    on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial
    difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or
    eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more
    credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables. Two of
    our customers, Macy’s, Inc. and Dillard Department Stores,
    Inc., in the aggregate constituted 31% of trade accounts
    receivable outstanding as of March 29, 2008. Our inability
    to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of
    these customers could have a material adverse effect on our
    business or financial condition. See Item 1 —

“Wholesale Credit Control.”

Our
    profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on
    margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure
    caused by many factors, including intense competition,
    consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to
    reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand.
    These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to
    retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to
    decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory
    levels

and/or

otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in
    our operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to



sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our
    profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Certain
    legal proceedings and regulatory matters could adversely impact
    our results of operations.

We are involved in certain legal proceedings and are subject to
    various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims,
    credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail
    store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters
    and other litigations. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if
    decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in
    material liability to the Company or have a negative impact on
    the Company’s reputation or relations with its employees,
    customers, licensees or other third parties. In addition,
    regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory
    proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs
    and may require that the Company devotes substantial time and
    resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental
    regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries where
    we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on
    our results of operations. See Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion of
    the Company’s legal matters.

Our
    business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are
    disrupted or cease to operate effectively.

The Company relies heavily on its computer systems to record and
    process transactions and manage and operate our business. We
    also utilize a sophisticated automated replenishment system to
    facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our
    wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution
    channels, and the collection of information for planning and
    forecasting. In addition, we have

e-commerce

and other Internet websites in the U.S.. Given the complexity of
    our business and the significant number of transactions that we
    engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain
    constant operation of our computer hardware and software
    systems. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are
    vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from,
    among other things, security breaches, computer viruses or power
    outages.

Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.

As of March 29, 2008, we source a significant portion of
    our products outside the U.S. through arrangements with
    over 400 foreign vendors in various countries. In Fiscal 2008,
    over 98%, by dollar value, of our products were produced outside
    the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. Risks
    inherent in importing our products include:

•

quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements with China and
    non-WTO countries. These agreements limit the amount and type of
    goods that may be imported annually from these countries;

•

changes in social, political and economic conditions or
    terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from
    the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are
    located;

•

the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or
    exports;

•

the imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports or exports;

•

significant fluctuations of the cost of raw materials;

•

significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security
    considerations;

•

the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings
    resulting in the potential assessment of special antidumping or
    countervailing duties; and

•

the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties
    either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy
    perceived illegal actions by national governments.

Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.



Our
    ability to conduct business in international markets may be
    affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
    risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets
    and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing
    international markets is subject to risks associated with
    international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.

We are also subject to general political and economic risks in
    connection with our international operations, including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other
    similar restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European
    Union, Japan, or other countries upon the import or export of
    our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions
    would have on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social or
    economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse
    effect on our business in the future or may require us to
    significantly modify our current business practices.

Our
    trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
    adequately protected outside the U.S.

We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are
    extremely important to our success and our competitive position.
    We devote substantial resources to the establishment and
    protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities
    worldwide. Significant counterfeiting of our products continues,
    however, and in the course of our international expansion we
    have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have
    acquired or claimed ownership rights in some trademarks that
    include Polo

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise
    have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past
    resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action
    and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken
    to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary
    rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material
    adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation
    of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and
    proprietary rights of others. Also, there can be no assurance
    that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of,
    trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will
    be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
    satisfaction or at all. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
    countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
    as do the laws of the U.S. See Item 1 —

“Trademarks,”

and Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings.”

Our
    business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer’s
    inability to produce our goods on time and to our
    specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend
    exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of
    all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our
    specifications primarily by international manufacturers. During
    Fiscal 2008, less than 2%, by dollar value, of our men’s
    and women’s products were manufactured in the U.S. and
    over 98%, by dollar value, of these products were manufactured
    in other countries. Two of the manufacturers engaged by us
    accounted for approximately 12% and 8% of our total production
    during Fiscal 2008. The primary production facilities of these
    two manufacturers are located in Asia. The inability of a
    manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner
    or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the
    delivery date requirements of our customers for those items,
    which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept
    deliveries or a substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of
    which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.



Our
    business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use
    acceptable labor practices.

We require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers
    to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote
    ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and
    monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do
    not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The
    violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer
    used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence
    of an independent manufacturer’s or licensing
    partner’s labor practices from those generally accepted as
    ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt, or
    otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or
    damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if we need to replace
    manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the production capacity of
    our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these
    competitors have greater financial and other resources than we
    have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for
    production and import quota capacity. If we experience a
    significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
    of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party
    manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional
    capacity will be available when required on terms that are
    acceptable to us. See Item 1 —

“Sourcing,
    Production and Quality.”

We enter into a number of
    purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for
    delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications
    and other standard industry provisions, but do not have
    long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the
    manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.

Our
    business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency
    fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars.
    However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result,
    the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the
    value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
    rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
    currency denominated prices at which our international
    businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales
    and licensing revenue generally is derived from sales in foreign
    currencies. These foreign currencies include the Japanese Yen,
    the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, and this revenue could
    be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Although we
    hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot
    assure that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a
    material adverse impact on our financial condition and results
    of operations. See Item 7 —

“Market Risk
    Management.”

We rely
    on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our
    licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our
    licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks
    specific to a licensing partner’s business, including, for
    example, risks associated with a particular licensing
    partner’s ability to:

•

obtain capital;

•

manage its labor relations;

•

maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively; and

•

maintain relationships with its customers.

Although some of our license agreements prohibit licensing
    partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our
    competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded
    from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered
    by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of
    sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are
    also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
    control over our licensing partners’ products and
    advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other
    things, operational and financial control over their businesses.
    Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor
    execution or financial difficulties with respect to any of our
    licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Our Licensing Segment.”



Failure
    to maintain licensing partners could harm our
    business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we could replace
    existing licensing partners if necessary, our inability to do so
    for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Our Licensing Segment.”

The
    voting shares of the Company’s stock are concentrated in
    one majority stockholder.

As of March 29, 2008, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities
    controlled by Mr. Ralph Lauren, owned approximately 87% of
    the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company.
    As a result, Mr. Lauren has the ability to exercise
    significant control over our business, including, without
    limitation, (i) the election of the Company’s
    Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a
    class, and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our
    stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our
    certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or
    sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

The
    trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall
    based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other
    financial performance.

Our business planning process is designed to maximize our
    long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an
    earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe
    that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the
    Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we
    recognize that from time to time it may be helpful to provide
    investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast
    of net sales and earnings. While we generally expect to provide
    updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal
    quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our
    forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. If and
    when we announce actual results that differ from those that have
    been predicted by us, outside analysts or others, the market
    price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on
    the predictions when making investment decisions with respect to
    our securities do so at their own risk. We take no
    responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such
    changes in the prices of our securities.

Risks
    Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete

A
    downturn in the global economy may affect consumer purchases of
    discretionary items and luxury retail products, which could
    adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic
    factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer
    spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance and home products
    industries, including, among others:

•

general business conditions;

•

economic downturns;

•

employment levels;

•

downturns in the stock market;

•

interest rates;

•

the housing market;

•

consumer debt levels;

•

the availability of consumer credit;

•

increases in fuel prices;

•

taxation; and

•

consumer confidence in future economic conditions.

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail
    products, including our products, may decline during
    recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income
    is lower. A downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in
    which we, or our licensing partners, sell our products may
    materially adversely affect our businesses and our revenues and
    profits. See Item 7 —

“Overview — Our Objectives and Risks”

for further discussion.



The domestic and international political situation also affects
    consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of
    terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to
    a decrease in consumer spending.

We face
    intense competition in the worldwide apparel industry.

We face a variety of intense competitive challenges from other
    domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual apparel
    producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more
    diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources
    than we have. We compete with these companies primarily on the
    basis of:

•

anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors
    and styles that appeal to consumers;

•

appropriately pricing products;

•

failure to anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;

•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain
    efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective
    presentation of our products at retail stores.

We also face increasing competition from companies selling
    apparel and home products through the Internet. Although RL
    Media sells our products domestically through the Internet,
    increased competition in the worldwide apparel, accessories and
    home product industries from Internet-based competitors could
    reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our
    results of operations.

The
    success of our business depends on our ability to respond to
    constantly changing fashion trends and consumer
    demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate
    and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as
    to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of
    consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty
    and are subject to rapid change. We cannot assure you that we
    will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
    successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the
    future. In addition, we cannot assure you that any new products
    or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by
    consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and
    respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion
    trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of
    our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold
    inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be
    forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of
    excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business and
    impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate
    consumer demand for its products or if manufacturers fail to
    supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience
    inventory shortages, which may result in unfilled orders,
    negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty
    and result in lost revenues. See Item 1 —

“Sourcing, Production and Quality.”

Item 2.

Properties

We lease space for our retail and factory showrooms, and
    warehouse and office space in various domestic and international
    locations. We do not own any real property except for our
    distribution facility in Greensboro, North Carolina and a
    parcel of land adjacent to the facility, and retail stores in
    Southampton, New York and Nantucket, Massachusetts.
    Contemporaneous with our acquisition of the remaining 50% equity
    interest in RL Media, we entered into a transition services
    agreement with Value Vision to continue to provide warehousing,
    order fulfillment and call center functions for RL Media through
    August 2008. RL Media has begun performing warehousing, order
    fulfillment and call center functions on its own in Fiscal 2008.



We believe that our existing facilities are well maintained, in
    good operating condition and are adequate for our present level
    of operations.

We have begun to occupy a 360,000 square foot leased
    distribution facility in High Point, North Carolina, for our RL
    Media business during Fiscal 2008. The term of the lease
    commenced on August 17, 2007 and expires on
    January 31, 2023.

We paid aggregate rent in Fiscal 2008 of approximately
    $62 million for our non-retail facilities. We anticipate
    that we will be able to extend those leases which expire in the
    near future on terms satisfactory to us or relocate to
    facilities timely and on acceptable terms.

As of March 29, 2008, we operated 313 retail stores,
    totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet. Aggregate
    annual rentals for retail space in Fiscal 2008 totaled
    approximately $146 million. We anticipate that we will be
    able to extend those leases which expire in the near future on
    satisfactory terms or relocate to desirable locations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to various claims relating to allegations
    of security breaches in certain of its retail store information
    systems. These claims have been made by various credit card
    issuers, issuing banks and credit card processors with respect
    to cards issued by them pursuant to the rules imposed by certain
    credit card issuers, particularly
    Visa

®

and
    MasterCard

®

.
    The allegations include fraudulent credit card charges, the cost
    of replacing credit cards, related monitoring expenses and other
    related claims.

In Fiscal 2005, the Company was subject to various claims
    relating to an alleged security breach of its point-of-sale
    systems that occurred at certain Polo retail stores in the
    U.S. The Company had previously recorded a reserve for an
    aggregate amount of $13 million to provide for its best
    estimate of losses related to these claims. The Company
    ultimately paid approximately $11 million in settlement of
    these various claims and the eligibility period for filing any
    such claims has expired.

In addition, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company
    was notified of an alleged compromise of its retail store
    information systems that process its credit card data for
    certain Club Monaco stores in Canada. As of the end of Fiscal
    2007, the Company had recorded a total reserve of
    $5.0 million for this matter based on its best estimate of
    exposure at that time. While the final settlement of this matter
    is pending approval by the credit card issuers, the
    Company’s Canadian credit card processor returned
    three-quarters of the funds previously escrowed to cover



potential claims by the end of April 2008. Accordingly, based on
    the progress in this matter and the available evidence to date,
    the Company reversed $4.1 million of its original
    $5.0 million reserve into income during Fiscal 2008. The
    Company was also recently advised that the Quebec Privacy
    Commission has ceased its investigation of Club Monaco in
    connection with this matter.

The Company is cooperating with law enforcement authorities in
    both the U.S. and Canada in their investigations of these
    matters.

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd.
    (“Wathne”), our domestic licensee for luggage and
    handbags, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren,
    our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other
    things, federal trademark law violations, breach of contract,
    breach of obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and
    negligent misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other
    relief, injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the Court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. We believe this lawsuit to be without
    merit, and moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims.
    Wathne cross-moved for partial summary judgment. A hearing on
    these motions occurred on November 1, 2007. The judge
    presiding in this case provided a written ruling on the summary
    judgment motion on April 11, 2008. The Court granted
    Polo’s summary judgment motion to dismiss in large measure,
    and denied Wathne’s cross-motion. Wathne has appealed the
    dismissal of its claims. A trial date has not yet been
    established in connection with this matter. We intend to
    continue to contest the few remaining claims in this lawsuit
    vigorously. Accordingly, management does not expect that the
    ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit against the
    U.S. Polo Association Inc. (“USPA”), Jordache,
    Ltd. (“Jordache”) and certain other entities
    affiliated with them, alleging that the defendants were
    infringing on our trademarks. In connection with this lawsuit,
    on July 19, 2001, the USPA and Jordache filed a lawsuit
    against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York. This suit, which was effectively a
    counterclaim by them in connection with the original trademark
    action, asserted claims related to our actions in connection
    with our pursuit of claims against the USPA and Jordache for
    trademark infringement and other unlawful conduct. Their claims
    stemmed from our contacts with the USPA’s and
    Jordache’s retailers in which we informed these retailers
    of our position in the original trademark action. All claims and
    counterclaims, except for our claims that the defendants
    violated our trademark rights, were settled in September 2003.
    We did not pay any damages in this settlement.

On July 30, 2004, the Court denied all motions for summary
    judgment, and trial began on October 3, 2005 with respect
    to the four “double horseman” symbols that the
    defendants sought to use. On October 20, 2005, the jury
    rendered a verdict, finding that one of the defendants’
    marks violated our world famous Polo Player Symbol trademark and
    enjoining its further use, but allowing the defendants to use
    the remaining three marks. On November 16, 2005, we filed a
    motion before the trial court to overturn the jury’s
    decision and hold a new trial with respect to the three marks
    that the jury found not to be infringing. The USPA and Jordache
    opposed our motion, but did not move to overturn the jury’s
    decision that the fourth double horseman logo did infringe on
    our trademarks. On July 7, 2006, the judge denied our
    motion to overturn the jury’s decision. On August 4,
    2006, we filed an appeal of the judge’s decision to deny
    our motion for a new trial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Second Circuit. On March 4, 2008, the Court of Appeals
    issued a decision affirming the judgment of the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

On March 2, 2006, a former employee at our Club Monaco
    store in Los Angeles, California filed a lawsuit against us in
    the San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations of
    California wage and hour laws. The plaintiff purports to
    represent a class of Club Monaco store employees who allegedly
    have been injured by being improperly classified as exempt
    employees and thereby not receiving compensation for overtime
    and not receiving meal and rest breaks. The complaint seeks an
    unspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement of
    profits,



attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. We believe this suit
    is without merit and intend to contest it vigorously.
    Accordingly, management does not expect that the ultimate
    resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs
    purport to represent a class of employees who allegedly have
    been injured by not properly being paid commission earnings, not
    being paid overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to
    work off of the clock while waiting to enter or leave the store
    and being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave the store.
    The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory
    damages, damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of
    profits, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    and declaratory relief. We have filed a cross-claim against one
    of the plaintiffs for his role in allegedly assisting a former
    employee misappropriate Company property. Subsequent to
    answering the complaint, we had the action moved to the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California.
    We believe this suit is without merit and intend to contest it
    vigorously. Accordingly, management does not expect that the
    ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

On August 21, 2007, eleven former and current employees of
    our Club Monaco stores in California filed a lawsuit in Los
    Angeles Superior Court alleging similar claims as the Club
    Monaco action in San Francisco. The complaint seeks an
    unspecified amount of compensatory damages, attorney’s fees
    and punitive damages. We believe this suit is without merit and
    intend to contest it vigorously. Accordingly, management does
    not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or
    financial position.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims and
    proceedings involving credit card fraud, trademark and
    intellectual property, licensing, employee relations and other
    matters incidental to our business. We believe that the
    resolution of these other matters currently pending will not
    individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition or results of operations.

On May 20, 2003, our Board of Directors initiated a regular
    quarterly cash dividend program of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per
    share on an annual basis, on our Class A common stock.
    Approximately $20 million was recorded as a reduction to
    retained earnings during Fiscal 2008 in connection with these
    dividends.

As of May 16, 2008, there were 1,144 holders of record of
    our Class A common stock and 14 holders of record of our
    Class B common stock. All of our outstanding shares of
    Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren and
    related entities and are convertible at any time into shares of
    Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.

    expansion of the Company’s existing common stock repurchase
    program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to an
    additional $250 million of Class A common stock.
    Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to
    overall business and market conditions. This program does not
    have a fixed termination date.

The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder
    return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) on our
    Class A common stock with the cumulative total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, our peer group
    for the preceding fiscal year (the “Old Peer Group”),
    and a peer group index of companies that we believe are similar
    to ours (the “New Peer Group”) for the period from
    March 28, 2003, the last trading day in the Company’s
    2003 fiscal year, through March 28, 2008, the last trading
    day in the Company’s 2008 fiscal year. Our Old Peer Group
    consisted of Coach, Estee Lauder, Jones Apparel, Kellwood,
    Kenneth Cole, Liz Claiborne, Phillips Van Heusen,
    Tiffany & Co., VF Corp., Warnaco, LVMH, Burberry,
    Christian Dior, PPR SA, Hermes International, Richemont,
    Luxottica and Tod’s Group. Our New Peer Group consists of
    the same companies in our Old Peer Group with the exception of
    Kellwood and Christian Dior. All calculations done for foreign
    companies in our New Peer Group are made using the local foreign
    issue of such companies. We believe that the companies in our
    New Peer Group index, taken together, are more comparable to our
    businesses. The returns are calculated by assuming an investment
    in the Class A common stock and each index of $100 on
    March 29, 2003, with all dividends reinvested.

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and
    distribution of premium lifestyle products including men’s,
    women’s and children’s apparel, accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishings. Our long-standing reputation
    and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    Our brand names include

Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren
    Purple Label,



Ralph Lauren Collection, Black Label, Blue Label, Lauren
    by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear,
    Chaps, Club Monaco

and

American Living

, among others.

We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale,
    Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing 57%
    of Fiscal 2008 net revenues) consists of wholesale-channel
    sales made principally to major department stores, specialty
    stores and golf and pro shops located throughout the U.S.,
    Europe and Asia. Our retail business (representing 39% of Fiscal
    2008 net revenues) consists of retail-channel sales
    directly to consumers through full-price and factory retail
    stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South
    America and Asia, and through our retail internet site located
    at www.RalphLauren.com (formerly known as Polo.com). In
    addition, our licensing business (representing 4% of Fiscal
    2008 net revenues) consists of royalty-based arrangements
    under which we license the right to third parties to use our
    various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale
    of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances,
    in specified geographical areas for specified periods.
    Approximately 25% of our Fiscal 2008 net revenues was
    earned in international regions outside of the U.S. and
    Canada. See Note 20 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues
    by geographic location.

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels
    of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher
    retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends
    result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments
    and key vacation travel, back-to-school and holiday periods in
    the Retail segment.

Our
    Objectives and Risks

Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury
    lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a
    proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed
    through multiple retail channels in global markets, a
    disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet.
    Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the
    current global economy as further discussed below, we believe
    our core strengths will continue to allow us to execute our
    strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income
    and operating cash flow.

During the course of the past five fiscal years, our revenues,
    net income and operating cash flow have grown to record levels.
    See “Selected Financial Information” included
    elsewhere in this Fiscal 2008

10-K

for
    further discussion.

Our operating success has been driven by the Company’s
    focus on six key objectives:

•

Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core
    and heritage-driven brand;

•

Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution
    channels and geographic regions;

•

Improving brand control and positioning;

•

Focusing on selective strategic partnerships;

•

Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a
    worldwide business; and

•

Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow.

As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control
    has evolved from primarily that of a mono-brand
    U.S. centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of
    product and geographic licenses to that of a portfolio of
    lifestyle brands with a “direct control” model over
    most of our brands, products and international territories. We
    believe that this broader and better-diversified portfolio mix
    positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers a range
    of products, price points and channels of distribution, and our
    size and global operations favorably position us to take
    advantage of synergies in design, sourcing and distribution.

In connection with our key objectives, we intend to continue to
    pursue opportunities for growth during the course of Fiscal 2009
    and beyond. These opportunities and continued investment
    initiatives include:

•

Global expansion of our retail presence in various formats and
    key markets, including Paris, France;

•

Ongoing integration of our newly acquired Japanese businesses,
    and the transition of certain key product categories operated
    under pre-existing sublicenses in Japan into our own business;



•

Further development of a wide array of luxury accessories
    product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small
    leathergoods and watches/jewelry; and

•

Further growth in our initiatives to develop new lifestyle
    brands in partnership with select department and specialty
    stores, such as our current

American Living

brand with
    J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“JCPenney”) and our current

Chaps

brand with Kohl’s Department Stores, Inc.

Global
    Economic Uncertainty

Our opportunities for long-term growth are accompanied by
    significant challenges and risks, particularly in the near term.
    Specifically, our business is dependent on consumer demand for
    our products. We believe that significant uncertainty and a
    slowdown in the U.S. macroeconomic environment negatively
    impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items
    during most of Fiscal 2008. Despite the more challenging
    U.S. retail environment that affected both the
    Company’s wholesale customers and retail channels, we
    continued to experience reported revenue growth for all quarters
    during Fiscal 2008. If the U.S. macroeconomic environment
    continues to be weak

and/or

spreads to significant markets outside of the U.S., these
    worsening economic conditions could have a continuing negative
    effect on the Company’s sales and operating margin growth
    rates across all segments in Fiscal 2009.

As of March 29, 2008, largely in response to the
    U.S. macroeconomic environment, our traditional retail
    partners in the U.S. have reduced their initial wholesale
    orders for fall 2008 apparel products. This contraction in the
    U.S. department and specialty store channel in Fiscal 2009
    is expected to be more than offset primarily by sales in our new

American Living

product line and by the continuing growth
    in profitability of our businesses in Europe and Japan.

See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

”
    included elsewhere in this Fiscal 2008

for
    further discussion.

Summary
    of Financial Performance

Operating
    Results

During Fiscal 2008, we reported revenues of $4.880 billion,
    net income of $419.8 million and net income per diluted
    share of $3.99. This compares to revenues of
    $4.295 billion, net income of $400.9 million and net
    income per diluted share of $3.73 during Fiscal 2007. As
    discussed further below, the comparability of our operating
    results has been affected by recent acquisitions and the
    adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”)
    No. 109” (“FIN 48”), effective as of
    the beginning of Fiscal 2008.

On a reported basis, our operating performance in Fiscal 2008
    was primarily driven by 13.6% revenue growth, led by our
    Wholesale and Retail segments (including the effect of certain
    acquisitions that occurred in the first quarter of Fiscal 2008;
    see “

Recent Developments

” for further
    discussion). This revenue growth was partially offset by a
    decline in gross profit percentage of 30 basis points to
    54.1% primarily due to the purchase accounting effects of our
    recent acquisitions, as well as increases in selling, general
    and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses and
    amortization expense of intangible assets driven by these
    acquisitions. The increase in SG&A expense was also
    attributable to the overall growth in our business. Excluding
    the effects of acquisitions, revenues increased by 8.6%, led by
    our Wholesale segment (8.1% growth) and Retail segment (9.7%
    growth). Excluding the effects of acquisitions, gross profit as
    a percentage of net revenues increased 10 basis points as
    improved performance in our European wholesale operations more
    than offset increased domestic promotional activity associated
    in part with the challenging U.S. retail environment.

Net income and net income per diluted share increased in Fiscal
    2008 as compared to Fiscal 2007, principally due to a
    $20.1 million decrease in the provision for income taxes
    and an $0.8 million increase in operating income. The
    decrease in the provision for income taxes was driven by a
    310 basis point decline in our effective tax rate.

See

“Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition”

described below for
    further discussion of the recent acquisitions and the adoption
    of FIN 48.



Financial
    Condition and Liquidity

Our financial position reflects the funding of our recent
    acquisitions, our increased share repurchase activity and the
    overall relative strength of our business results. Excluding
    $74.3 million of short-term investments classified in our
    consolidated balance sheet outside of cash and cash equivalents,
    we ended Fiscal 2008 in a net debt position (total debt less
    total cash and cash equivalents) of $127.7 million,
    compared to a net cash position (total cash and cash equivalents
    less total debt) of $165.1 million at the end of Fiscal
    2007.

The decrease in our net cash position as of the end of Fiscal
    2008 was primarily due to the Japanese Business Acquisitions (as
    defined and discussed under

“Recent
    Developments”

), net of approximately $239 million
    of Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired. The decrease is also
    due to an increase in our share repurchases and capital
    expenditures. Our stockholders’ equity increased to
    $2.390 billion as of March 29, 2008, compared to
    $2.335 billion as of March 31, 2007. This increase was
    primarily due to our net income and higher other comprehensive
    income during Fiscal 2008, offset in part by our increased share
    repurchase activity and a $62.5 million reduction in
    retained earnings in connection with the adoption of FIN 48.

We generated $695.4 million of cash from operations in
    Fiscal 2008, compared to $796.1 million in Fiscal 2007. The
    decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the
    absence of the approximately $180 million, net of certain
    tax withholdings, received under the Eyewear Licensing Agreement
    (as defined in Note 22 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements) in the prior fiscal year. We
    used our cash availability to reinvest in our business through
    capital spending and acquisitions, as well as in connection with
    our common stock repurchase program. In particular, we spent
    $217.1 million for capital expenditures primarily
    associated with global retail store expansion, construction and
    renovation of department store

shop-in-shops

and investments in our facilities and technological
    infrastructure. We used $188.7 million primarily to fund
    the Japanese Business Acquisitions and the Small Leathergoods
    Business Acquisition, net of cash acquired (see

“Recent
    Developments”

for further discussion). We also used
    $475.4 million to repurchase 6.0 million shares of
    Class A common stock.

Transactions
    Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

The comparability of the Company’s operating results for
    the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by
    certain transactions, including:

•

Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and
    Fiscal 2006. In particular, the Company completed the Japanese
    Business Acquisitions on May 29, 2007, the Small
    Leathergoods Business Acquisition on April 13, 2007, the RL
    Media Minority Interest Acquisition on March 28, 2007, the
    Polo Jeans Business Acquisition on February 3, 2006 and the
    Footwear Business Acquisition on July 15, 2005 (each as
    defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements).

•

The adoption of the provisions of FIN 48 as of the
    beginning of Fiscal 2008 (April 1, 2007). Accruals required
    for Fiscal 2008 under the provisions of FIN 48 were
    entirely offset by the reversal of tax reserves, principally
    associated with an audit settlement and the expiration of a
    statute of limitations. The incremental impact of the adoption
    of FIN 48 decreased the effective tax rate by 97 basis
    points in Fiscal 2008. See Note 12 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion
    of the Company’s adoption of FIN 48.

•

The change in accounting for stock-based compensation effective
    as of the beginning of Fiscal 2007 (April 2, 2006), as well
    as certain pretax charges related to retail asset impairments
    recognized during each of Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2006.

•

Certain pretax charges (reversals) related to restructurings and
    the Company’s credit card contingencies during the fiscal
    years presented.



A summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax
    income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below

The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as
    necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising
    from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or
    transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and
    other financial statement users individually should consider the
    types of events and transactions that have affected operating
    trends.

Recent
    Developments

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company completed its previously
    announced transactions to acquire control of certain of its
    Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed
    arrangements, consistent with the Company’s long-term
    strategy of international expansion. In particular, the Company
    acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares of Impact
    21 Co., Ltd. (“Impact 21”) that it did not previously
    own in a cash tender offer (the “Impact 21
    Acquisition”), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact
    21 from approximately 20% to approximately 97%. Impact 21
    conducts the Company’s men’s, women’s and jeans
    apparel and accessories business in Japan under a pre-existing,
    sub-license arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the
    remaining 50% interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation
    (“PRL Japan”), which holds the master license to
    conduct Polo’s business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and
    Seibu (the “PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition”).
    Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan
    Minority Interest Acquisition are herein referred to as the
    “Japanese Business Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately
    $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately
    $12 million. In January 2008, at an Impact
    21 shareholders meeting, the Company obtained the necessary
    approvals to complete the process of acquiring the remaining
    approximately 3% of outstanding shares not exchanged as of the
    close of the tender offer period (the “minority
    squeeze-out”). In February 2008, the Company acquired
    approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares
    outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. The Company
    expects the minority squeeze-out to be successfully concluded in
    the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, at an estimated aggregate cost
    of $9 million.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and ¥20.5 billion of borrowings
    under a one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment
    and restatement to the Company’s existing credit facility.
    The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on
    May 22, 2008 using approximately $200 million of
    Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as part of the
    acquisition.

The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    within minority interest expense the amount of Impact 21’s
    net income allocable to the holders of the approximate 80% of
    the Impact 21 shares not owned by the Company prior to the
    closing date of the tender offer. The results of operations for
    PRL Japan have already been consolidated by the Company as
    described further in Note 2 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements.



Acquisition
    of Small Leathergoods Business

On April 13, 2007, the Company acquired from Kellwood
    Company (“Kellwood”) substantially all of the assets
    of New Campaign, Inc., the Company’s licensee for
    men’s and women’s belts and other small leather goods
    under the

Ralph Lauren

,

Lauren

and

Chaps

brands in the U.S. (the “Small Leathergoods
    Business Acquisition”). The assets acquired from Kellwood
    are operated under the name of “Polo Ralph Lauren
    Leathergoods” and allowed the Company to further expand its
    accessories business. The acquisition cost was approximately
    $10 million. Kellwood provided various transition services
    to the Company for a period of up to six months from the date of
    acquisition.

The results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods
    business have been consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing April 1, 2007.

Acquisition
    of RL Media Minority Interest

On March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    equity interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (“RL
    Media”) formerly held by NBC-Lauren Media Holdings, Inc., a
    subsidiary wholly owned by the National Broadcasting Company,
    Inc. (“NBC”) (37.5%) and Value Vision Media, Inc.
    (“Value Vision”) (12.5%) (the “RL Media Minority
    Interest Acquisition”). RL Media conducts the
    Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through the RalphLauren.com internet site and is
    consolidated by the Company as a wholly owned subsidiary. The
    acquisition cost was $175 million. In addition, Value
    Vision entered into a transition services agreement with the
    Company to provide order fulfillment and related services over a
    period of up to seventeen months from the date of the
    acquisition of the RL Media minority interest.

American
    Living

In Fiscal 2008, the Company launched

American Living

, a
    new lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for
    distribution by JCPenney through the Company’s new Global
    Brand Concepts (“GBC”) group. The Company began
    shipping related product to JCPenney in December 2007 to support
    the launch of this new product line. The success of

American
    Living

and the introduction of new product categories in
    both the U.S. and overseas may be negatively impacted in
    Fiscal 2009 by ongoing economic uncertainty. See “

Global
    Economic Uncertainty

” for further discussion.

Other
    Developments

In late Fiscal 2007, the Company formed the Ralph Lauren Watch
    and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL Watch
    Company”), a joint venture with Financiere Richemont SA
    (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group. The
    Company began to incur certain

start-up

costs in Fiscal 2008 to support the launch of this business,
    which is expected to occur in the spring of calendar 2009.

See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the
    Company’s acquisitions and joint venture formed during the
    fiscal years presented.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $584.7 million, or 13.6%, to $4.880 billion in Fiscal
    2008 from $4.295 billion in Fiscal 2007. The increase was
    driven by a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and
    favorable foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of
    acquisitions, net revenues increased by $371.2 million, or
    8.6%. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues increased by
    $442.2 million primarily as a result of incremental
    revenues from the newly acquired Impact 21 and Small
    Leathergoods businesses, the inclusion of revenues from the
    initial shipments of the

American Living

product line to
    JCPenney and increased sales in our global menswear and
    womenswear product lines, primarily driven by strong performance
    in Europe. The increase in net revenues also was driven by an
    increase of $169.4 million in our Retail segment revenues
    as a result of an increase in comparable global retail store
    sales, continued global store expansion and growth in
    RalphLauren.com sales. The increase in net



revenues was partially offset by a decrease of
    $26.9 million in licensing revenue, primarily due to a
    decrease in international licensing royalties as a result of the
    loss of licensing revenues from Impact 21, which is now
    consolidated as part of the Wholesale segment. Also contributing
    to the decrease in licensing revenue was a net decrease in
    domestic licensing royalties, primarily due to the absence of
    approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and
    design-service fees received in connection with the termination
    of a licensing arrangement in the prior fiscal year.

Wholesale net revenues

— The net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

the inclusion of $254 million of revenues from the newly
    acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, net of
    intercompany eliminations;

•

an approximate $47 million increase in our European
    businesses on a constant currency basis driven by increased
    sales in our menswear and womenswear product lines;

•

an aggregate $81 million net increase in our
    U.S. businesses. The net increase was primarily due to the
    initial shipments of the

American Living

product line to
    JCPenney; an increase in our menswear shipments; a net increase
    in womenswear, primarily driven by

Chaps

, partially
    offset by increased promotional activity; and an increase in
    footwear attributable to increased door penetration. Offsetting
    these increases were a decline in our childrenswear product
    lines due to weaker sales at department stores and increased
    promotional activity; and a planned reduction in our off-price
    channel denim business; and

•

a $60 million increase in revenues due to a favorable
    foreign currency effect, primarily related to the continued
    strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar
    in Fiscal 2008.

Retail net revenues

— For purposes of the
    discussion of retail operating performance below, we refer to
    the measure “comparable store sales.” Comparable store
    sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for
    at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing
    during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of
    comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either
    relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage
    expansion of 25% or greater) or closed for 30 or more
    consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the
    calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have
    been in their location or in a newly renovated state for at
    least one full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information
    includes both Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores.



The increase in retail net revenues primarily reflects:

•

a $87 million aggregate net increase in comparable
    full-price and factory store sales on a global basis, including
    a net aggregate favorable $22 million foreign currency
    effect. This net increase was driven by increases in comparable
    store sales as provided below:

•

a $52 million aggregate net increase in sales from
    non-comparable stores, primarily relating to new store openings
    within the past fiscal year. There was a net increase in average
    global store count of 9 stores, to a total of 313 stores,
    compared to the prior fiscal year. The net increase in store
    count was primarily due to several new domestic and
    international full-price and factory store openings; and

•

a $30 million, or 26.4%, increase in sales at
    RalphLauren.com.

Licensing revenue

— The net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

a $26 million net decrease in international licensing
    royalties, primarily due to the loss of licensing revenues from
    Impact 21, which is now consolidated as part of the Wholesale
    segment; and

•

a $1 million net decrease in domestic licensing royalties,
    primarily due to the absence of approximately $8 million of
    minimum royalty and design-service fees received in connection
    with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior
    fiscal year. The net decrease was partially offset by an
    increase in eyewear-related royalties as a result of the
    licensing agreement entered into with Luxottica, which took
    effect on January 1, 2007.

Gross Profit.

Cost of goods sold includes the
    expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale,
    including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well
    as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory obsolescence.
    The costs of selling merchandise, including preparing the
    merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and
    order charges, are included in SG&A expenses.

Gross profit increased by $301.9 million, or 12.9%, to
    $2.638 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $2.336 billion in
    Fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
    decreased by 30 basis points to 54.1% in Fiscal 2008 from
    54.4% in Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the dilutive effect of
    our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of acquisitions,
    gross profit increased by $208.6 million, or 8.9%, and
    gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased
    10 basis points compared to Fiscal 2007. The increase in
    gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was due to improved
    performance in our European wholesale operations which generally
    carry higher margins, offset in part by increased domestic
    promotional activity as well as a slight change in the overall
    relative sales mix between the Wholesale segment and the higher
    margin Retail and Licensing segments.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a
    variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix
    among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products
    sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs.
    These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.



We anticipate that current macroeconomic challenges, including
    inflationary pressures on raw material and fuel costs, could
    negatively affect the cost of our products and related gross
    profit percentages in Fiscal 2009. See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors”

for further discussion.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses primarily include
    compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, information
    technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with
    finance and administration. SG&A expenses increased by
    $269.1 million, or 16.2%, to $1.932 billion in Fiscal
    2008 from $1.663 billion in Fiscal 2007. SG&A expenses
    as a percent of net revenues increased to 39.6% in Fiscal 2008
    from 38.7% in Fiscal 2007. The net 90 basis point
    increase was primarily associated with operating expenses at the
    Company’s newly acquired businesses and certain

start-up

costs related to new business launches. The $269.1 million
    increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs of approximately
    $91 million for our newly acquired Impact 21 and Small
    Leathergoods businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to
    transition service arrangements;

•

higher stock-based compensation expense of approximately
    $27 million primarily due to an increase in the
    Company’s share price as of the date of its annual equity
    award grant in the second quarter of Fiscal 2008 compared to the
    share price as of the comparable grant date in Fiscal 2007;

•

higher compensation-related expenses (excluding stock-based
    compensation) of approximately $56 million, principally
    relating to increased selling costs associated with higher
    retail and wholesale sales and our ongoing product line
    expansion, including

American Living

and a dedicated
    dress business across multiple brands, as well as
    severance-related costs;

•

an approximate $39 million increase in rent and utility
    costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses,
    including rent expense related to certain retail stores
    scheduled to open in Fiscal 2009;

•

an approximate $25 million increase in depreciation expense
    primarily associated with global retail store expansion,
    construction and renovation of department store

shop-in-shops

and investments in our facilities and technological
    infrastructure; and

•

an approximate $36 million increase in SG&A expenses
    due to unfavorable foreign currency effects, primarily related
    to the continued strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2008.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $31.6 million, to $47.2 million in Fiscal
    2008 from $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The net increase
    was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets
    acquired in connection with the Company’s recent
    acquisitions. See

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion of the acquisitions.

Impairment of Retail Assets.

A non-cash
    impairment charge of $5.0 million was recognized in Fiscal
    2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets
    in the Company’s Retail segment to their estimated fair
    value. The impairment was primarily attributable to
    lower-than-expected operating cash flow performance in certain
    stores. No impairment charges were recognized in Fiscal 2007.
    See Note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $4.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2007 primarily
    associated with the Club Monaco retail business. No significant
    restructuring charges were recognized in Fiscal 2008. See
    Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    slightly by $0.8 million, or 0.1%, to $653.4 million
    in Fiscal 2008 from $652.6 million in Fiscal 2007.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased
    180 basis points, to 13.4% in Fiscal 2008 from 15.2% in
    Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the effect of purchase accounting
    relating to the acquisitions. Excluding the effect of
    acquisitions, operating income increased by $43.0 million,
    or 6.6%, while operating income as a percentage of net revenues
    decreased 30 basis points in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in
    operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily
    reflected the increase in SG&A expenses due to business
    expansion, partially offset by an increase in gross profit
    margin as previously discussed.

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $87.6 million, including the favorable effects from the
    Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions.
    Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, wholesale operating
    income increased by $61.4 million primarily as a result of
    increased net sales, including shipments of

American
    Living

, and improved gross margin primarily in our European
    wholesale operations, offset in part by increased domestic
    promotional activity in certain product categories. The increase
    was partially offset by higher net SG&A expenses in
    support of our new product lines.

Retail operating income

decreased by $20.0 million,
    including the unfavorable effects from purchase accounting
    related to the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition. Excluding
    the effects of the acquisition, retail operating income
    decreased by $9.0 million primarily as a result of
    increased markdown activity, a non-cash impairment charge of
    $5.0 million, and an increase in occupancy and other
    operating costs principally related to worldwide store
    expansion, as we continue to develop and invest in our existing
    retail concepts and formats. The decrease also reflected an
    increase in selling-related salaries and associated costs, as
    well as increased fulfillment costs associated with higher sales
    at RalphLauren.com.

Licensing operating income

decreased by
    $44.9 million, including the unfavorable effects from the
    Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions.
    Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, licensing operating
    income increased by $12.5 million primarily due to an
    increase in eyewear-related royalties. This increase was
    partially offset by the absence of approximately $8 million
    of minimum royalty and design-service fees received in
    connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in
    the prior fiscal year.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $33.6 million, primarily as a result of increases in
    brand-related marketing costs, including costs associated with
    various events related to the Company’s
    40th anniversary, and compensation-related and facilities
    costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The
    increase in compensation-related costs includes higher
    stock-based compensation expense and severance-related costs, as
    previously discussed under

SG&A expenses

.

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

were
    comprised of a reversal of an excess reserve in the amount of
    $4.1 million in Fiscal 2008 related to the Credit Card
    Matters (as defined in Note 15 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements). Unallocated legal and
    restructuring charges were $7.6 million in Fiscal 2007 and
    were principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring
    Plan charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 11 to
    the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and
    costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card Matters.
    No significant unallocated legal and restructuring charges were
    recognized in Fiscal 2008.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to a loss of
    $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007. Foreign currency losses
    increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a
    $2.0 million write-off of foreign currency option
    contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign currency
    exposures associated with the Japanese Business Acquisitions,
    most of which have expired unexercised as of March 29,
    2008, hedge activity associated with the return of capital from
    a foreign subsidiary and intercompany royalty activity, as well
    as the timing of the settlement of third party and



intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a
    long-term investment nature). Foreign currency gains and losses
    are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the
    U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including
    amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense increased
    by $4.1 million to $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from
    $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase is primarily due
    to additional borrowings undertaken during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2008 in connection with the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions (see

“Debt and Covenant Compliance”

for further discussion), as well as the higher principal
    amount of our outstanding Euro denominated debt. This increase
    was partially offset by the absence of overlapping interest on
    debt during the period between the issuance of the 2006 Euro
    Debt and the repayment of approximate €227 million
    principal amount of 6.125% notes outstanding that were due
    on November 22, 2006, from an original issuance of
    €275 million in 1999 (the “1999 Euro Debt”),
    in the prior fiscal year.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, decreased by $1.4 million, to
    $24.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from $26.1 million in
    Fiscal 2007. This decrease was principally driven by lower
    average interest rates, lower balances on our invested excess
    cash and higher transaction-related costs.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

The equity in loss of equity-method
    investees of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 related to certain

start-up

costs associated with the recently formed joint venture, RL
    Watch Company, which the Company accounts for under the equity
    method of accounting. The equity in income of equity-method
    investees of $3.0 million in Fiscal 2007 related to Impact
    21, which was previously accounted for as an equity-method
    investment. The results of operations for Impact 21 have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, no equity income
    related to Impact 21 was recorded in Fiscal 2008. See

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion of
    the Company’s Impact 21 Acquisition.

Minority Interest Expense.

Minority interest
    expense decreased by $13.2 million, to $2.1 million in
    Fiscal 2008 from $15.3 million in Fiscal 2007. The decrease
    is related to the Company’s acquisition of the remaining
    50% interests in RL Media and PRL Japan. This decrease was
    partially offset by an increase related to the allocation of
    Impact 21’s net income to the holders of the approximate
    80% interest not owned by the Company prior to the closing date
    of the related tender offer and to the holders of the remaining
    approximate 3% interest not owned by the Company as of the end
    of Fiscal 2008. See

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by
    $20.1 million, or 8.3%, to $222.3 million in Fiscal
    2008 from $242.4 million in Fiscal 2007. This decrease was
    primarily due to a decrease in our reported effective tax rate
    of 310 basis points, to 34.6% in Fiscal 2008 from 37.7% in
    Fiscal 2007, and a decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2008
    compared to Fiscal 2007. The lower effective tax rate is
    primarily due to tax reserve reductions associated with an audit
    settlement and the expiration of a statute of limitations, lower
    state income taxes as well as a change in the geographic mix of
    earnings, partially offset by certain higher, non-deductible
    expenses under § 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the
    effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign
    jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective
    tax rate will change from year-to-year based on non-recurring
    factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of
    earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted
    tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and
    settlements, and the interaction of various global tax
    strategies. See “Critical Accounting Policies” for a
    discussion on the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the
    Company’s adoption of FIN 48 as of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2008.

Net Income.

Net income increased by
    $18.9 million, or 4.7%, to $419.8 million in Fiscal
    2008 from $400.9 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in
    net income principally related to the $20.1 million
    decrease in provision for income taxes discussed above and the
    $0.8 million increase in operating income. The increase was
    partially offset by reductions in operating income primarily
    related to the dilutive effect of purchase accounting, an
    increase in domestic promotional activity and higher SG&A
    expenses principally associated with our recent acquisitions.
    The net dilutive effect related to the Company’s recent
    acquisitions included approximately $53 million of non-cash
    amortization of intangible assets and inventory. See

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion of
    the Company’s acquisitions.



Net Income Per Diluted Share.

Net income per
    diluted share increased by $0.26, or 7.0%, to $3.99 per share in
    Fiscal 2008 from $3.73 per share in Fiscal 2007. The increase in
    diluted per share results was primarily due to the higher level
    of net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares
    outstanding for Fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year.

    2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $549.1 million, or 14.7%, to $4.295 billion in Fiscal
    2007 from $3.746 billion in Fiscal 2006. The increase was
    experienced in all geographic regions and was due to a
    combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Wholesale
    revenues increased by $373.4 million, primarily as a result
    of revenues from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business, the
    successful launch of the new Chaps for women and children
    product lines, and increased sales in our global menswear and
    womenswear product lines. The increase in net revenues also was
    driven by a revenue increase of $184.6 million in our
    Retail segment as a result of improved comparable global retail
    store sales, continued store expansion and growth in
    RalphLauren.com sales. Licensing revenue decreased by
    $8.9 million primarily due to the loss of product licensing
    revenue related to the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses (now
    included as part of the Wholesale segment). Net revenues for our
    three business segments are provided below:

Wholesale net revenues

— the net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

the inclusion of $190 million of revenues from our newly
    acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses;

•

a $156 million aggregate net increase led by our global
    menswear, womenswear and childrenswear businesses, primarily
    driven by strong growth in our Lauren product line, increased
    full-price sell-through performance in our menswear business and
    the effects from the successful domestic launch of our new Chaps
    for women and children product lines. These increases were
    partially offset by a decline in footwear sales (excluding the
    impact from acquisition) due to our planned integration efforts
    as we repositioned the related product line; and

•

a $27 million increase in revenues due to a favorable
    foreign currency effect, primarily related to the strengthening
    of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2007.

Retail net revenues

— The net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

a $104 million aggregate net increase in comparable
    full-price and factory store sales on a global basis, including
    a net aggregate favorable $9 million foreign currency
    effect. This net increase was driven by increases in comparable
    store sales as provided below:

•

an increase in sales from non-comparable stores, primarily
    relating to new store openings within the past fiscal year.
    There was a net increase in global store count of 3 stores
    compared to the prior fiscal year, to a total of 292 stores. The
    net increase in store count was primarily due to several new
    openings of full-price stores, partially offset by the closure
    of certain Club Monaco Caban Concept and factory stores and Polo
    Jeans factory stores; and

•

a $26 million, or 28.9%, increase in sales at
    RalphLauren.com.

Licensing revenue

— the net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

the loss of licensing revenues from our Polo Jeans and Footwear
    Businesses now included as part of the Wholesale segment;

•

a decline in eyewear-related royalties due to the wind-down of
    the Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement prior to the
    commencement of the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement which took
    effect on January 1, 2007;

•

a decline in Home licensing royalties; and

•

a partially offsetting increase in international licensing
    royalties and the accelerated receipt and recognition of
    approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and
    design-service fees in connection with the termination of a
    domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased by
    $313.8 million, or 15.5%, to $2.336 billion in Fiscal
    2007 from $2.022 billion in Fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues also increased to 54.4% in Fiscal
    2007 from 54.0% in Fiscal 2006. The increase in gross profit
    reflected higher net sales and improved merchandise margins in
    our wholesale and retail businesses, including the continued
    emphasis on shifting the mix from off-price to full-price sales
    across our wholesale product lines, as well as the focus on
    improved inventory management. However, the overall improvement
    in gross profit margins was partially offset by the lower gross
    profit performance of our newly acquired Polo Jeans Business
    associated with the liquidation of existing inventory in
    anticipation of the redesign and launch of our new denim and
    casual sportswear product lines during spring of calendar 2007.
    Gross profit margins related to our Footwear Business have also
    been negatively impacted during Fiscal 2007, primarily by
    integration efforts as we repositioned the related product line.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses increased by
    $186.5 million, or 12.6%, to $1.663 billion in Fiscal
    2007 from $1.477 billion in Fiscal 2006. SG&A expenses
    as a percent of net revenues decreased to 38.7% in Fiscal 2007
    from 39.4% in Fiscal 2006. The 70 basis point improvement
    is primarily indicative of our ability to successfully leverage
    our global infrastructure as we acquire businesses and grow
    product lines organically. The $186.5 million net increase
    in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:

•

higher compensation-related expenses (excluding stock-based
    compensation) of approximately $69 million, principally
    relating to increased selling costs associated with higher
    retail sales and our ongoing worldwide retail store and product
    line expansion, and higher investment in infrastructure to
    support the ongoing growth of our businesses;

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs for our newly acquired Footwear
    and Polo Jeans Businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to
    transition service arrangements;

•

a $38 million increase in brand-related marketing and
    facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses;

•

an approximate $10 million increase in depreciation costs
    in connection with our increased capital expenditures and global
    expansion;

•

incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately
    $17 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R as
    of April 2, 2006 (see Note 18 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further
    discussion); and

•

a net reduction in credit card contingency charges of
    approximately $4 million.



Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $6.5 million, to $15.6 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $9.1 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase was due
    to the amortization of intangible assets related to the Polo
    Jeans Business acquired in February 2006 and the Footwear
    Business acquired in July 2005.

Impairment of Retail Assets.

A non-cash
    impairment charge of $10.8 million was recognized during
    Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets largely
    relating to our Club Monaco brand. No impairment charges were
    recognized in Fiscal 2007.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    decreased by $4.4 million, to $4.6 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $9.0 million in Fiscal 2006. Restructuring
    charges recognized in both periods were principally associated
    with the Club Monaco retail business. See Note 11 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    by $136.0 million, or 26.3%, to $652.6 million in
    Fiscal 2007 from $516.6 million in Fiscal 2006. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis
    points, to 15.2% in Fiscal 2007 from 13.8% in Fiscal 2006,
    reflecting our revenue growth, gross profit percentage expansion
    and improved SG&A expense leveraging. Operating income for
    our three business segments is provided below:

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $79.5 million, primarily as a result of higher net sales
    and improved gross margin rates in most product lines, as well
    as the incremental contribution from the newly acquired Polo
    Jeans Business and the new Chaps product lines. These increases
    were partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses in
    support of new product lines across all geographic territories
    and higher amortization expenses associated with intangible
    assets recognized in acquisitions.

Retail operating income

increased by $84.2 million,
    primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross
    margin rates, as well as the absence of a non-cash impairment
    charge of $10.8 million recognized in Fiscal 2006. These
    increases were partially offset by an increase in selling
    related salaries and associated costs in connection with the
    increase in retail sales, including RalphLauren.com, and
    worldwide store expansion, including the new Tokyo flagship
    store.

Licensing operating income

decreased by
    $11.9 million primarily due to the loss of royalty income
    formerly collected in connection with the Footwear and Polo
    Jeans Businesses, which have now been acquired. The decline in
    Home royalties also contributed to the decrease along with the
    decline in eyewear royalties, due to the wind-down of the
    Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement. These decreases
    were partially offset by an increase in international royalties,
    as well as the accelerated receipt and recognition of
    approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and
    design-service fees in connection with the termination of a
    domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $24.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in
    brand-related marketing, payroll-related and facilities costs to
    support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The increase in
    compensation-related costs includes higher stock-based
    compensation expense due to the adoption of FAS 123R (as
    further discussed in Note 18 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements).



Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

were
    $7.6 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to
    $16.1 million during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 charges were
    principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan
    charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 11 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and
    legal costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card
    Matters (as defined in Note 15 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements). Fiscal 2006 charges also
    primarily included the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of
    $9.0 million and legal costs of $6.8 million
    associated with the Credit Card Matters.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007, compared to a loss of
    $5.7 million in Fiscal 2006. The decrease in foreign
    currency losses compared to the prior fiscal year is due to the
    timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and
    payables (that were not of a long-term investment nature)
    between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased
    by $9.1 million to $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from
    $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase is primarily due
    to an increase in interest on capitalized leases due to
    additional obligations in Fiscal 2007 compared to the prior
    fiscal year and overlapping interest on debt during the period
    between the issuance of the 2006 Euro Debt and the repayment of
    the 1999 Euro Debt. In addition, prior year interest expense was
    favorably impacted by the interest rate swap agreements which
    were terminated at the end of Fiscal 2006.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, increased by $12.4 million, to
    $26.1 million in Fiscal 2007 from $13.7 million in
    Fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily driven by higher average
    interest rates and higher balances on our invested excess cash.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

Equity in the income of equity-method
    investees decreased by $1.3 million, to $3.0 million
    in Fiscal 2007 from $4.3 million in Fiscal 2006. This
    income relates to our 20% investment in Impact 21, a company
    that holds the sublicense with PRL Japan for our men’s,
    women’s and jeans businesses in Japan. See

“Recent
    Developments”

for further discussion of the
    Company’s Japanese Business Acquisitions that occurred in
    May 2007.

Minority Interest Expense.

Minority interest
    expense increased by $1.8 million, to $15.3 million in
    Fiscal 2007 from $13.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The net
    increase is primarily related to the improved operating
    performance of RL Media compared to the prior period and the
    associated allocation of income to the minority partners. As of
    March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in RL Media held by the minority partners (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion).

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by
    $47.5 million, or 24.4%, to $242.4 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006. This increase is a
    result of the increase in our pretax income, partially offset by
    a decrease in our reported effective tax rate, to 37.7% in
    Fiscal 2007 from 38.8% in Fiscal 2006. The lower effective tax
    rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, which
    resulted in more income being taxed at lower rates than in the
    previous fiscal year. See “Critical Accounting
    Policies” for a discussion on the accounting for uncertain
    tax positions and the Company’s adoption of FIN 48 in
    Fiscal 2008.

Net Income.

Net income increased by
    $92.9 million, or 30.2%, to $400.9 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $308.0 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase in
    net income principally related to our $136.0 million
    increase in operating income, as previously discussed, offset in
    part by an increase of $47.5 million in our provision for
    income taxes.

Net Income Per Diluted Share.

Net income per
    diluted share increased by $0.86, or 30.0%, to $3.73 per share
    in Fiscal 2007 from $2.87 per share in Fiscal 2006. The increase
    in diluted per share results was primarily due to the higher
    level of net income, partially offset by higher weighted-average
    diluted shares outstanding for Fiscal 2007.

“Net cash” is defined as total cash and cash
    equivalents less total debt and “net debt” is defined
    as total debt less total cash and cash equivalents.

The decrease in our net cash position as of the end of Fiscal
    2008 was primarily due to the Japanese Business Acquisitions,
    net of approximately $239 million of Impact 21’s cash
    on-hand acquired. As part of the Japanese Business Acquisitions,
    the Company borrowed ¥20.5 billion (approximately
    $206 million as of March 29, 2008) under a
    one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and
    restatement to the Company’s existing credit facility. The
    Company used the proceeds from these borrowings and available
    cash-on hand to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions. In
    addition, the Company spent $217.1 million for capital
    expenditures and used $475.4 million to repurchase
    6.0 million shares of Class A common stock.

The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to
    the Company’s net income and higher other comprehensive
    income during Fiscal 2008, offset in part by an increase in
    treasury stock as a result of the Company’s common stock
    repurchase program and a reduction in retained earnings of
    $62.5 million in connection with the adoption of
    FIN 48.

Subsequent to year end, the Company repaid its current
    maturities of debt using available cash on-hand.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities decreased to
    $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to
    $796.1 million in Fiscal 2007. This $100.7 million net
    decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by:

•

the absence of the approximately $180 million, net of
    certain tax withholdings, received under the Eyewear Licensing
    Agreement in the prior fiscal year; and

•

an increase in other receivables primarily attributable to the
    timing of estimated tax payments.



The above decreases were partially offset by:

•

an increase in net income before non-cash depreciation,
    amortization and stock-based compensation expenses;

•

improved accounts receivable cash collections in the
    Company’s Wholesale segment; and

•

the effects of ongoing inventory management, which resulted in
    lower average balance and increased inventory turns across
    certain businesses.

Other than the items described above, the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating
    fluctuations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $505.0 million in
    Fiscal 2008, as compared to $434.6 million in Fiscal 2007.
    The net increase in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

an increase in net cash used to fund the Company’s
    acquisitions. In Fiscal 2008, the Company used
    $188.7 million principally to fund the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods
    Business Acquisition; whereas in Fiscal 2007,
    $176.1 million was used primarily to fund the RL Media
    Minority Interest Acquisition;

•

an increase in cash used in connection with capital
    expenditures. In Fiscal 2008, the Company spent
    $217.1 million for capital expenditures, as compared to
    $184.0 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in capital
    expenditures is primarily associated with global retail store
    expansion, construction and renovation of department store

shop-in-shops

and investments in our facilities and technological
    infrastructure, including showrooms related to our new
    businesses;

•

an increase related to purchases of investments of
    $96.8 million, less proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments of $12.7 million, in Fiscal 2008; and

•

a partially offsetting decrease in cash deposits restricted in
    connection with taxes. During Fiscal 2008, $15.1 million of
    cash was restricted as compared to $74.5 million during
    Fiscal 2007. Restricted cash was placed in escrow with certain
    banks as collateral to secure guarantees of a corresponding
    amount made by the banks to certain international tax
    authorities on behalf of the Company.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net
    cash used in financing activities was $260.5 million in
    Fiscal 2008, as compared to $95.2 million in Fiscal 2007.
    The increase in net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

increased repurchases of the Company’s Class A common
    stock pursuant to the Company’s common stock repurchase
    program. Approximately 6.0 million shares of Class A
    common stock at a cost of $475.4 million were repurchased
    in Fiscal 2008, as compared to approximately 3.5 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $231.3 million in Fiscal 2007; and

•

a partially offsetting increase in proceeds from issuance of
    debt. Fiscal 2008 included the receipt of proceeds from
    borrowings of ¥20.5 billion (approximately
    $169 million as of the borrowing date) under a one-year
    term loan agreement in connection with the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2007 included the
    receipt of proceeds from the issuance of €300 million
    principal amount ($380.0 million) of 2006 Euro Debt, offset
    in part by the repayment of approximately €227 million
    principal amount ($291.6 million) of 1999 Euro Debt.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $796.1 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to
    $449.1 million for Fiscal 2006. This $347.0 million
    increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by the
    increase in net income, the receipt of approximately
    $180 million under the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement (net
    of certain tax withholdings) and the absence of the
    $100 million payment to settle the Jones-related Litigation
    in Fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher tax payments made in
    Fiscal 2007. Also offsetting the increase in operating cash flow
    was an increase in working capital needs during Fiscal 2007,
    primarily as a result of recent expansions and the overall
    growth in the business. This increase in working capital needs
    was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable days
    sales outstanding as a result of improved cash collections in
    the Company’s Wholesale segment. On a comparative basis,
    operating cash flows were reduced by $33.7 million as a
    result of a change in the reporting of excess tax benefits from
    stock-based compensation arrangements. That is, prior to the
    adoption of FAS 123R, benefits of tax deductions in excess
    of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash
    flows. FAS 123R requires excess tax benefits to be reported
    as a financing cash inflow rather than in operating cash flows
    as a reduction of taxes paid.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $434.6 million for
    Fiscal 2007, as compared to $539.2 million for Fiscal 2006.
    The net decrease in cash used in investing activities is
    primarily due to acquisition-related activities. In Fiscal 2007,
    the Company used $175 million to fund the acquisition of
    the remaining 50% equity interest in RL Media that it did not
    previously own, whereas in Fiscal 2006, approximately
    $380 million was used primarily to fund the acquisition of
    the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses. In addition, net cash
    used in investing activities for Fiscal 2007 included
    $74.5 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with
    certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees of a
    corresponding amount made by the banks to certain international
    tax authorities on behalf of the Company (see “Restricted
    Cash” within Note 3 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Net
    cash used in investing activities also included
    $184.0 million relating to capital expenditures, as
    compared to $158.6 million in the prior fiscal year.

Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Financing
    Activities.

Net cash used in financing activities
    was $95.2 million for Fiscal 2007, compared to net cash
    provided by financing activities of $33.5 million in Fiscal
    2006. The increase in net cash used in financing activities
    during Fiscal 2007 principally related to the repayment of
    approximately €227 million principal amount
    ($291.6 million) of the Company’s 1999 Euro Debt and
    the repurchase of 3.5 million shares of Class A common
    stock pursuant to its common stock repurchase program at a cost
    of $231.3 million. Partially offsetting the increase was
    the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of
    €300 million principal amount (approximately
    $380 million) of 2006 Euro Debt. This net increase in cash
    used in financing activities was partially offset by the change
    in the reporting of excess tax benefits from stock-based
    compensation arrangements of $33.7 million.

Liquidity

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are the cash
    flow generated from its operations, $450 million of
    availability under its credit facility, available cash and
    equivalents, investments and other financing options. These
    sources of liquidity are needed to fund the Company’s
    ongoing cash requirements, including working capital
    requirements, global retail store expansion, construction and
    renovation of

shop-in-shops,

investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions,
    dividends, debt repayment, stock repurchases, contingent
    liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other
    corporate activities. Management believes that the
    Company’s existing resources



of cash will be sufficient to support its operating, capital and
    debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, including
    the finalization of acquisitions and plans for business
    expansion.

As discussed below under the section entitled

“Debt and
    Covenant Compliance,”

the Company had no revolving
    credit borrowings outstanding under its credit facility as of
    March 29, 2008. However, as discussed further below, the
    Company may elect to draw on its credit facility or other
    potential sources of financing for, among other things, a
    material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency
    (including uncertain tax positions) or a material adverse
    business development.

In May 2007, the Company completed the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions. These transactions were funded with available cash
    on-hand and ¥20.5 billion of borrowings under a
    one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and
    restatement to the Company’s existing credit facility (the
    “Term Loan”). Borrowings under the Term Loan bore
    interest at a fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the
    borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using
    approximately $200 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand
    acquired as part of the acquisition.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

In August 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    an expansion of the Company’s existing common stock
    repurchase program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to
    an additional $250 million of Class A common stock.
    Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject
    to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2008,
    6.1 million shares of Class A common stock were
    repurchased at a cost of $476.4 million under the expanded
    and pre-existing programs, including $24.0 million
    (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of
    the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. The
    remaining availability under the common stock repurchase program
    was approximately $142 million as of March 29, 2008.

In addition, during Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan.

In Fiscal 2007, share repurchases amounted to 3.5 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $231.3 million. In Fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased
    69.3 thousand shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $3.8 million.

In May 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
    further expansion of the Company’s existing common stock
    repurchase program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to
    an additional $250 million of Class A common stock.

Dividends

The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per
    outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007
    and Fiscal 2006. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was
    $20.5 million in Fiscal 2008, $20.9 million in Fiscal
    2007 and $20.8 million in Fiscal 2006.

The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly
    dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision
    to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
    discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will
    depend on, among other things, the Company’s results of
    operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other
    factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Debt
    and Covenant Compliance

Euro
    Debt

The Company has outstanding approximately €300 million
    principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013
    (the “2006 Euro Debt”). The Company has the option to
    redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at any time at a redemption
    price equal to the principal amount plus a premium. The Company
    also has the option to redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at any
    time at par plus accrued interest, in the event of certain
    developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial redemption of
    the 2006 Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance. In the
    event of a change of control



of the Company, each holder of the 2006 Euro Debt has the option
    to require the Company to redeem the 2006 Euro Debt at its
    principal amount plus accrued interest.

The carrying value of the 2006 Euro Debt was $472.8 million
    and $398.8 million as of March 29, 2008 and
    March 31, 2007, respectively.

Revolving
    Credit Facility and Term Loan

The Company has a credit facility that provides for a
    $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through
    November 2011 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
    Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of March 29, 2008, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility, but the Company was
    contingently liable for $23.0 million of outstanding
    letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase
    commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its
    borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the
    agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
    facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory
    reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the
    Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility
    (“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the
    Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to
    Consolidated EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”), as such
    terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of March 29,
    2008, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to
    the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s
    Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenant described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of
    Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities
    controlled by Mr. Lauren fail to maintain a specified
    minimum percentage of the voting power of the Company’s
    common stock.

The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22,
    2007 to provide for the addition of the Term Loan made to Polo
    JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The
    Term Loan was guaranteed by the Company, as well as the other
    subsidiaries of the Company which currently guarantee the Credit
    Facility. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to finance the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions. Borrowings under the Term Loan
    bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the
    borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using
    approximately $200 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand
    acquired as part of the acquisition. See Note 5 for further
    discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

The following table summarizes certain of the Company’s
    aggregate contractual obligations as of March 29, 2008, and
    the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are
    expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flow
    in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm
    commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal
    course of business and, if necessary, availability under its
    $450 million credit facility or other potential sources of
    financing.

The following is a description of the Company’s material,
    firmly committed contractual obligations as of March 29,
    2008:

•

Term Loan

represents the principal amount due at maturity
    of the Company’s outstanding Term Loan on a
    U.S. dollar-equivalent basis. The Term Loan was repaid on
    May 22, 2008 using available cash on-hand;

•

Euro Debt

represents the principal amount due at maturity
    of the Company’s outstanding 2006 Euro Debt on a
    U.S. dollar-equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any
    fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments;

•

Lease obligations

represent the minimum lease rental
    payments under noncancelable leases for the Company’s real
    estate and operating equipment in various locations around the
    world. Approximately 78% of these lease obligations relates to
    the Company’s retail operations. Information has been
    presented separately for operating and capital leases. In
    addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to
    pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased
    real estate properties; and

•

Inventory purchase commitments

represent the
    Company’s legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or
    minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices.

Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the
    non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
    $155.2 million recognized as a result of the adoption of
    FIN 48. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has
    been excluded because the Company cannot make a reliable
    estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled,
    if ever.

The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts
    included in current liabilities, other than the current
    maturities of debt, in the consolidated balance sheet as of
    March 29, 2008 as these items will be paid within one year;
    and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows
    associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue) or the cash
    outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent
    a “purchase obligation” as the term is used herein
    (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items).

The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would
    require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See
    Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for a description of the Company’s contingent
    commitments not included in the above table.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company’s off-balance sheet firm commitments, which
    include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding
    commitments to investees, amounted to approximately
    $29.8 million as of March 29, 2008. The Company



does not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements,
    transactions, obligations or other relationships with
    unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a
    material current or future effect upon its financial condition
    or results of operations.

MARKET
    RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company is exposed to a variety of risks, including changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain
    anticipated cash flows from its international operations and
    possible declines in the fair value of reported net assets of
    certain of its foreign operations, as well as changes in the
    fair value of its fixed-rate debt relating to changes in
    interest rates. Consequently, in the normal course of business
    the Company employs established policies and procedures,
    including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage
    such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative
    transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is
    exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts
    will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only
    entering into contracts with carefully selected financial
    institutions based upon their credit ratings and other financial
    factors. The Company’s established policies and procedures
    for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include
    reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

The Company manages its exposure to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange
    contracts. Refer to Note 14 to the audited consolidated
    financial statements for a summarization of the notional amounts
    and fair values of the Company’s foreign currency exchange
    contracts outstanding as of March 29, 2008.

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts —
    General

From time to time, the Company may enter into forward foreign
    currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from
    exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany
    royalty payments made by certain of its international
    operations, intercompany contributions made to fund certain
    marketing efforts of its international operations, other foreign
    currency-denominated operational obligations including payroll,
    rent, insurance, and benefit payments, and foreign
    currency-denominated revenues. As part of its overall strategy
    to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of
    the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British
    Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign
    currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve-month to
    two-year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency
    exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three
    months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout
    the hedging period.

The Company records the above described foreign currency
    exchange contracts at fair value in its consolidated balance
    sheets. Foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash
    flow hedges at hedge inception are accounted for in accordance
    with FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and subsequent
    amendments (collectively, “FAS 133”). As such, to
    the extent these hedges are effective the related gains or
    losses are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains
    and losses are then recognized in our consolidated statements of
    operations as follows:

•

Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as part of the
    cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold
    when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency gains
    (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Operational Obligations

— Recognized primarily
    within SG&A expenses in the period in which the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings.

The Company recognized a net loss on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in earnings of approximately $8 million for
    Fiscal 2008, and net gains of approximately $4 million and
    $5 million for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, respectively.



Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts — Other

On October 10, 2007, the Company entered into a foreign
    exchange contract to purchase €13.5 million at a fixed
    rate. This contract hedges the foreign currency exposure related
    to the annual Euro interest payment due on October 6, 2008
    for Fiscal 2009 in connection with the Company’s
    outstanding 2006 Euro Debt. In accordance with FAS 133, the
    contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge. Since neither
    the terms of the hedge contract or the underlying exposure have
    changed, the related gains of $0.7 million have been
    reclassified from stockholders’ equity to foreign currency
    gains (losses) within our consolidated statement of operations
    to offset the related transaction loss arising from the
    remeasurement of the associated foreign currency-denominated
    accrued interest liability, as permitted by FAS 133, during
    Fiscal 2008.

On April 2, 2007, the Company entered into a similar
    foreign exchange contract to purchase €13.5 million at
    a fixed rate, hedging the foreign currency exposure related to
    the annual Euro interest payment made on October 4, 2007
    for Fiscal 2008. This contract also was designated as a cash
    flow hedge. Consistent with the accounting treatment discussed
    above, the related gains of $1.1 million were reclassified
    from stockholders’ equity to foreign currency gains
    (losses) within our consolidated statement of operations during
    Fiscal 2008.

During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company entered
    into foreign currency option contracts with a notional value of
    $159 million giving the Company the right, but not the
    obligation, to purchase foreign currencies at fixed rates by
    May 23, 2007. These contracts hedged the majority of the
    foreign currency exposure related to the financing of the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions, but did not qualify under
    FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. The Company did not
    exercise any of the contracts and recognized a loss of
    $1.6 million within foreign currency gains (losses) in our
    consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2008.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, the
    Company entered into a foreign currency exchange contract with a
    notional value of $5 million hedging the foreign currency
    exposure related to an intercompany term loan provided by Polo
    Ralph Lauren Corporation to Ralph Lauren Retail Japan
    (“RLRJ”) in connection with the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions minority squeeze-out, as discussed in Note 5.
    This contract, which hedges the foreign currency exposure
    related to a Yen-denominated payment to be made by RLRJ during
    the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, did not qualify under
    FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. As such, the
    Company recognized a related loss of $0.4 million within
    foreign currency gains (losses) in our consolidated statement of
    operations during Fiscal 2008.

Sensitivity

The Company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the
    effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values
    of the Company’s derivative financial instruments. To
    perform the sensitivity analysis, the Company assesses the risk
    of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like
    movement by all foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio
    against the U.S. dollar. Based on all foreign currency
    exchange contracts outstanding as of March 29, 2008, a 10%
    devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of
    foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as
    of March 29, 2008 would result in approximately
    $2 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10%
    appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in
    approximately $2 million of net unrealized gains. As the
    Company’s outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts
    are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted
    transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10%
    devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes
    in the underlying hedged items.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company designated the entire principal amount of its
    outstanding 2006 Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries. As required by
    FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative
    instrument or a non-derivative financial instrument (such as
    debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a
    foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a
    translation adjustment under FAS No. 52, “Foreign
    Currency Translation,” to the extent it is effective as a
    hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the 2006 Euro Debt
    resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and
    continue to be, reported in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company
    recorded within accumulated



other comprehensive income the translation effects of the 2006
    Euro Debt to U.S. dollars, resulting in net losses of
    $45.4 million for Fiscal 2008 and $24.5 million for
    Fiscal 2007, and a net gain of $4.2 million for Fiscal 2006.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered
    into three forward-starting interest rate swap contracts
    aggregating €200 million notional amount of
    indebtedness in anticipation of the Company’s proposed
    refinancing of the 1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in
    October 2006. The Company designated these agreements as a cash
    flow hedge of a forecasted transaction to issue new debt in
    connection with the planned refinancing of its 1999 Euro Debt.
    The interest rate swaps hedged a total of
    €200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest
    rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of
    the three interest swap contracts, the Company paid a
    weighted-average fixed rate of interest of 4.1% and received
    variable interest based upon six-month EURIBOR. The Company
    terminated the swaps on September 28, 2006, which was the
    date the interest rate for the 2006 Euro Debt was determined. As
    a result, the Company made a payment of approximately
    €3.5 million ($4.4 million based on the exchange
    rate in effect on that date) in settlement of the swaps. An
    amount of $0.2 million was recognized as a loss for the
    three months ending September 30, 2006 due to the partial
    ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result of the
    forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006 instead
    of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999 Euro
    Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million has been deferred
    as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity and is being recognized in earnings as an adjustment to
    interest expense over the seven-year term of the 2006 Euro Debt.

Sensitivity

As of March 29, 2008, the Company had no variable-rate debt
    outstanding. As such, the Company’s exposure to changes in
    interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate 2006 Euro
    Debt. As of March 29, 2008, the carrying value of the 2006
    Euro Debt was $472.8 million and the fair value was
    $423.0 million. A 25 basis point increase or decrease
    in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or
    increase the fair value of the 2006 Euro Debt by approximately
    $5 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based
    on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro
    currency exchange rates and an immediate across-the-board
    increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no
    other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.

The Term Loan of ¥20.5 billion made to Polo JP Acqui,
    B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was repaid by
    the Company by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using
    approximately $200 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand
    acquired as part of the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

Investment
    Risk Management

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss
    positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly
    basis. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations,
    including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with
    general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting
    specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include
    (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair
    value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition,
    credit worthiness and near-term prospects of the issuer,
    (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) future
    economic conditions and market forecasts and (v) the
    Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value.
    As of March 29, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s
    available-for-sale investments was $0.4 million below their
    respective par value. This gross unrealized loss has been
    recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet, as the Company
    believes the investments are not other-than-temporarily
    impaired. The Company limits its exposure by primarily investing
    in highly rated investments issued by municipalities.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 60,
    “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
    Accounting Policies” (“FRR 60”), suggests
    companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those
    accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers
    an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations and
    requires significant judgment and estimation on



the part of management in its application. The Company’s
    estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities
    and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are
    inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that
    other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same
    facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of
    alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the
    following list represents its critical accounting policies as
    contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the
    Company’s significant accounting policies, see Notes 3
    and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements.

Sales
    Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts

A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and
    net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that
    portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In
    particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of
    returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational
    chargebacks and certain cooperative advertising allowances.
    Retail revenue, including

e-commerce

sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns.

In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season
    markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes
    historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market
    conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to
    determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant
    judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation,
    including an analysis of specific risks on a

customer-by-customer

basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging
    analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has
    historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this
    information, management provides a reserve for the estimated
    amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management
    believes that the Company’s major customers are sound and
    creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business
    operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on
    the Company’s net sales, cash flows

and/or

financial condition.

See “Accounts Receivable” in Note 3 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an
    analysis of the activity in the Company’s sales reserves
    and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal
    years presented.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning product and fashion product.
    Estimated realizable value of distressed inventory is determined
    based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the
    Company’s individual product lines for this category of
    inventory, the impact of market trends and economic conditions,
    and the value of current orders in-house relating to the future
    sales of this category of inventory. Estimates may differ from
    actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in
    inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market
    conditions. The Company’s historical estimates of these
    costs and its provisions have not differed materially from
    actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.

Purchase
    Accounting

The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the
    purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of
    acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on
    their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the
    purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets
    acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires
    management’s judgment and often



involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions,
    including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and
    outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples,
    among other items.

In addition, in connection with its recent business
    acquisitions, the Company has settled certain pre-existing
    relationships. These pre-existing relationships include
    licensing agreements and litigation in the case of the
    acquisition of the Polo Jeans Business. In accordance with the
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 04-1,

“Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the
    Parties to a Business Combination,” the Company is required
    to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these
    transactions between the value of the business acquired and the
    value of the settlement of any pre-existing relationships in
    proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the
    terms of the pre-existing relationships were determined to not
    be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be
    recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is
    required to determine the respective fair values of the business
    acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre-existing
    relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent
    valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (“FAS 142”). Under FAS 142, goodwill,
    including any goodwill included in the carrying value of
    investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting,
    and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment
    at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair
    values to their carrying values. Finite-lived intangible assets
    are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and,
    along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment
    periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable in accordance with FAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“FAS 144”).

In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is
    determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by
    comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book
    value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
    of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and
    performance of the second step of the impairment test is
    unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
    its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test
    is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
    The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the
    implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with
    the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair
    value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an
    amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill
    is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill
    recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of
    the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and
    liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible
    assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
    combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to
    acquire the reporting unit.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first
    step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair
    value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit
    (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step
    of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and
    often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
    Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the
    fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
    impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such
    charge. To assist management in the process of determining
    goodwill impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from
    independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are
    primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market
    comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use
    significant estimates and assumptions, including projected
    future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting
    the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates
    and determination of appropriate market comparables.

The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
    asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition,
    in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability,
    the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected
    to result from the use of the asset



and eventual disposition in accordance with FAS 144. To the
    extent the estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows
    attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted
    cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment
    loss is recognized equal to the difference.

There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with
    the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill or other
    intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented.

Impairment
    of Other Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. In
    evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company
    uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the
    extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
    attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between
    the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to
    be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of
    disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair
    value less costs to sell.

In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various
    factors into account, including changes in merchandising
    strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, and the
    impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased
    local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows
    is an estimate of future performance, there may be future
    impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet
    expectations.

During Fiscal 2008, the Company recorded impairment charges of
    $5.0 million to reduce the carrying value of certain
    long-lived assets in its Retail segment to their estimated fair
    value. No impairment charges were recorded in Fiscal 2007.
    During Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges of
    $10.8 million to reduce the carrying value of certain
    retail fixed assets to their estimated fair value.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes” (“FAS 109”). Under this method,
    income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current
    taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded
    based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and
    include the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax
    reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of
    certain net operating loss, capital loss and general business
    credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amount of assets and
    liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as
    determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company
    accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or
    rates in the period of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when
    management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some
    portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

Effective April 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48.
    Upon the adoption of the provisions of FIN 48, the Company
    changed its policy related to the accounting for income tax
    uncertainties. If the Company considers that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
    recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit
    by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and
    the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To
    the extent that the Company’s estimates change or the final
    tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts
    recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision
    in the period in which such determinations are made. If the
    initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax
    benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and
    subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are
    changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise
    the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the
    position to more-likely-than-not, (ii) the statute of
    limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an
    audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the
    appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as
    current only when the Company expects to pay cash



within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any,
    are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations and are
    classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the
    Company’s income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48.

Contingencies

The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in
    the ordinary course of conducting its business, including
    certain litigations, alleged information system security breach
    matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters,
    various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property
    matters and disputes. In accordance with FAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies”
    (“FAS 5”), the Company records a liability for
    such contingencies to the extent that it concludes their
    occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In
    addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable
    settlement of a contingency could exceed the established
    liability, the Company discloses the estimated impact on its
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
    Management considers many factors in making these assessments.
    As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently
    unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex
    judgments about future events including, but not limited to,
    court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and
    governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss
    contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.

Stock-based
    Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted
    FAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“FAS 123R” or the “Statement”), using
    the modified prospective application transition method. Under
    this transition method, the compensation expense recognized in
    the consolidated statements of operations beginning
    April 2, 2006 includes compensation expense for
    (a) all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
    vested as of April 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation,” as amended by FAS No. 148,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure” (“FAS 123”) and
    (b) all stock-based payments granted subsequent to
    April 1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair value estimated
    in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R.

Prior to April 2, 2006, the Company accounted for
    stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method
    in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” (“APB 25”), and adopted the
    disclosure-only provisions of FAS 123. Accordingly, the
    Company did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance
    of stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than
    the market price at the date of grant. However, as required, the
    Company disclosed, in the notes to the consolidated financial
    statements, the pro forma expense impact of the stock option
    grants as if the fair-value-based recognition provisions of
    FAS 123 were applied. Compensation expense was previously
    recognized for restricted stock and restricted stock units. The
    effect of forfeitures on restricted stock and restricted stock
    units was recognized when such forfeitures occurred.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which
    requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key
    assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key
    factors influencing the estimation process include the expected
    term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor,
    the expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate, among
    others. Generally, once stock option values are determined,
    current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed,
    even if the estimates used are different from the actuals.

Determining the fair value of stock-based compensation at the
    date of grant requires significant judgment by management,
    including estimates of the above Black-Scholes assumptions. In
    addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of
    stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual
    results differ significantly from these estimates, if management
    changes its assumptions for future stock-based award grants, or
    if there are



changes in market conditions, stock-based compensation expense
    and the Company’s results of operations could be materially
    impacted.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based RSUs to certain of its senior executives
    and non-employee directors. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to such senior executives and other key
    executives, and certain other employees of the Company. The fair
    values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair
    value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to
    reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities
    that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation
    expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the
    related service period when attainment of the performance goals
    is deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of
    management.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other
    procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
    issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time period specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
    Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that material
    information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
    that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s
    management, including its principal executive and principal
    financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal
    year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation,
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective, as of the fiscal year end covered by
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

in timely making known to them material information relating to
    the Company and the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries
    required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or
    submitted under the Exchange Act.



(b) Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in Securities Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and preparation of financial statements for external
    purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    for preparation of our financial statements; providing
    reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company’s assets are made in accordance with management
    authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our
    financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely
    basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
    over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute
    assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would
    be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was
    made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in
    future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on
    the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this
    evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s
    internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of
    the fiscal year end covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company acquired
    control of certain of its Japanese businesses that were formerly
    conducted under pre-existing licensed arrangements. In
    particular, the Company acquired approximately 77% of the
    outstanding shares of Impact 21 that it did not previously own
    in a cash tender offer (as further defined and discussed in
    Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements). The Company is in the process of evaluating Impact
    21’s internal controls. However, as permitted by related
    SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses,
    the Company excluded Impact 21 from management’s annual
    assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2008. In
    the aggregate, Impact 21 represented 14.2% of the total
    consolidated assets (including purchase accounting allocations),
    5.2% of total consolidated revenues and 4.6% of total
    consolidated operating income of the Company as of and for the
    fiscal year ended March 29, 2008.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
    Reporting

Except as discussed below, there has been no change in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

The Company is in the process of evaluating the internal control
    structure of Impact 21 and determining how best to integrate and
    improve the various processes, systems, resources and controls
    supporting that business. In the interim, the Company has
    designed and implemented various transitional controls over
    financial reporting to supplement the existing internal controls
    at Impact 21.

Description
    of Business

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (“PRLC”) is a global
    leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium
    lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s and
    children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. PRLC’s long-standing reputation and
    distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    PRLC’s brand names include

Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph
    Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Collection, Black Label, Blue
    Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren
    Childrenswear, Chaps, Club Monaco

and

American
    Living

, among others. PRLC and its subsidiaries are
    collectively referred to herein as the “Company,”
    “we,” “us,” “our” and
    “ourselves,” unless the context indicates otherwise.

The Company classifies its businesses into three segments:
    Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. The Company’s wholesale
    sales are made principally to major department and specialty
    stores located throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Company
    also sells directly to consumers through full-price and factory
    retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South
    America and Asia, and through its retail internet site located
    at www.RalphLauren.com (formerly known as Polo.com). In
    addition, the Company often licenses the right to unrelated
    third parties to use its various trademarks in connection with
    the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as
    apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographical areas
    for specified periods.

2.

Basis of
    Presentation

Basis
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements present the financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company
    and all entities in which the Company has a controlling voting
    interest. The consolidated financial statements also include the
    accounts of any variable interest entities in which the Company
    is considered to be the primary beneficiary and such entities
    are required to be consolidated in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“US
    GAAP”).

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of the minority
    ownership interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation
    (“PRL Japan”) in May 2007, the Company consolidated
    PRL Japan, formerly a 50%-owned venture with Onward Kashiyama
    Co. Ltd and its affiliates (“Onward Kashiyama”) and
    The Seibu Department Stores, Ltd (“Seibu”), pursuant
    to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities” (“FIN 46R”). PRL Japan holds the
    master license to conduct the Company’s business in Japan.
    Additionally, prior to the acquisition of the minority ownership
    interests in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (“RL Media”) in
    March 2007, the Company consolidated RL Media, formerly a
    50%-owned venture with NBC-Lauren Media Holdings, Inc., a
    subsidiary wholly owned by the National Broadcasting Company,
    Inc. (“NBC”) and Value Vision Media, Inc. (“Value
    Vision”), pursuant to FIN 46R. RL Media conducts the
    Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through an internet site known as RalphLauren.com.
    See Note 5 for further discussion of the acquisitions
    referred to above, including their respective bases of
    consolidation in the fiscal years presented.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company utilizes a

52-53 week

fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As
    such, fiscal year 2008 ended on March 29, 2008 and
    reflected a 52-week period (“Fiscal 2008”); fiscal
    year 2007 ended on March 31, 2007 and reflected a 52-week
    period (“Fiscal 2007”); and fiscal year 2006 ended on
    April 1, 2006 and also reflected a 52-week period
    (“Fiscal 2006”).

The financial position and operating results of the
    Company’s consolidated PRL Japan and Impact 21 Co., Ltd.
    (“Impact 21”) entities located in Japan are reported
    on a one-month lag. The net effect of this reporting lag is not

F-6


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

material to the consolidated financial statements. Similarly,
    prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the financial
    position and operating results of RL Media were reported on a
    three-month lag. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, RL
    Media changed its fiscal year, which was formerly on a
    calendar-year basis, to conform with the Company’s
    fiscal-year basis. In connection with this change, the
    three-month reporting lag for RL Media was eliminated for the
    fiscal years presented. The net effect from this change in RL
    Media’s fiscal year was not material to the consolidated
    financial statements for Fiscal 2006 and was reflected in
    retained earnings as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements include reserves for customer
    returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns and operational
    chargebacks; reserves for the realizability of inventory;
    reserves for litigation and other contingencies; useful lives
    and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets;
    accounting for income taxes and related uncertain tax positions;
    the valuation of stock-based compensation and related expected
    forfeiture rates; and accounting for business combinations.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    periods’ financial information in order to conform to the
    current period’s presentation, including a reclassification
    of $175 million of assets related to the RL Media Minority
    Interest Acquisition (as defined in Note 5) that were
    pushed down from Corporate to the Retail segment in Fiscal 2008
    that should have been reported as part of the Retail segment in
    Fiscal 2007. See Note 20.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when
    there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has
    occurred, price has been fixed or is determinable, and
    collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenue within the Company’s Wholesale segment is
    recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of
    estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns,
    operational chargebacks and certain cooperative advertising
    allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from
    management and discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for
    end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends,
    seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market
    conditions and retailer performance. Estimates for operational
    chargebacks are based on actual notifications of order
    fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company
    reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The
    Company’s historical estimates of these costs have not
    differed materially from actual results.

Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at
    the time of sale to consumers.

E-commerce

revenue from sales of products ordered through the
    Company’s retail internet site known as RalphLauren.com is
    recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its
    customers. Such revenue also is reduced by an estimate of
    returns.

Gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability
    until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
    The Company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the
    likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is remote
    and the Company determines that it does not have a legal
    obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to the
    relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property.

F-7


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized when earned in
    accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements,
    generally based upon the higher of (a) contractually
    guaranteed minimum royalty levels or (b) estimates of sales
    and royalty data received from the Company’s licensees.

The Company accounts for sales and other related taxes on a net
    basis, excluding such taxes from revenue.

Cost
    of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and
    produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in,
    and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage
    and inventory obsolescence. Gains and losses associated with
    foreign currency exchange contracts related to the hedging of
    inventory purchases also are recognized within cost of goods
    sold when the inventory being hedged is sold. The costs of
    selling merchandise, including preparing the merchandise for
    sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges,
    are included in selling, general and administrative
    (“SG&A”) expenses.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

The costs associated with shipping goods to customers are
    reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling
    costs incurred approximated $108 million in Fiscal 2008,
    $92 million in Fiscal 2007 and $77 million in Fiscal
    2006. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are
    included in revenue.

Advertising
    Costs

In accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 93-7,

“Reporting on Advertising Costs,” advertising costs,
    including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when
    the advertisement is first exhibited. In accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,”
    costs of out-of-store advertising paid to wholesale customers
    under cooperative advertising programs are expensed as an
    advertising cost if both the identified advertising benefit is
    sufficiently separable from the purchase of the Company’s
    products by customers and the fair value of such benefit is
    measurable. Otherwise, such costs are reflected as a reduction
    of revenue. Costs of in-store advertising paid to wholesale
    customers under cooperative advertising programs are not
    included in advertising costs, but are reflected as a reduction
    of revenues since the benefits are not sufficiently separable
    from the purchases of the Company’s products by customers.

Advertising expense amounted to approximately $188 million
    for Fiscal 2008, $181 million for Fiscal 2007 and
    $166 million for Fiscal 2006. Deferred advertising costs,
    which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet
    been exhibited or services that have not yet been received, were
    approximately $8 million and $3 million at the end of
    Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and operating results of foreign
    operations are primarily consolidated using the local currency
    as the functional currency. Local currency assets and
    liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the
    balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are
    translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
    Resulting translation gains or losses are included in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    Gains and losses on translation of intercompany loans with
    foreign subsidiaries of a long-term investment nature also are
    included within this component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company also recognizes gains and losses on transactions
    that are denominated in a currency other than the respective
    entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses also include amounts realized on the settlement
    of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are either
    of a short-term investment nature or were previously of a
    long-term investment nature and deferred as a component of
    stockholders’ equity.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in
    earnings and separately disclosed in the consolidated statements
    of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, consists
    of net income (loss) and other gains and losses affecting equity
    that, under US GAAP, are excluded from net income (loss). The
    components of other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company
    primarily consist of foreign currency translation gains and
    losses; unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
    investments; unrealized gains and losses related to the
    accounting for defined benefit plans; and deferred gains and
    losses on hedging instruments, such as forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and changes in
    the fair value of the Company’s Euro-denominated debt
    designated as a hedge of changes in the fair value of the
    Company’s net investment in certain of its European
    subsidiaries.

Net
    Income Per Common Share

Net income per common share is determined in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”)
    No. 128, “Earnings per Share”
    (“FAS 128”). Under the provisions of
    FAS 128, basic net income per common share is computed by
    dividing the net income applicable to common shares after
    preferred dividend requirements, if any, by the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Weighted-average common shares include shares of the
    Company’s Class A and Class B common stock.
    Diluted net income per common share adjusts basic net income per
    common share for the effects of outstanding stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other
    potentially dilutive financial instruments, only in the periods
    in which such effect is dilutive under the treasury stock method.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to
    calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to
    those shares used in calculating diluted net income per common
    share as follows:

Options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
    greater than the average market price of the common stock during
    the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not
    included in the computation of diluted net income per common
    share. In addition, the Company has outstanding
    performance-based restricted stock units that are issuable only
    upon the satisfaction of certain performance goals. Such units
    only are included in the computation of diluted shares to the
    extent the underlying performance conditions (a) are
    satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or
    (b) would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period
    were the end of the related contingency period and the result
    would be dilutive. As of the end of Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and
    Fiscal 2006, there was an aggregate of approximately
    1.5 million, 1.0 million and 0.8 million,
    respectively, of additional shares issuable upon the exercise of
    anti-dilutive options

and/or

the
    contingent vesting of performance-based restricted stock units
    that were excluded from the diluted share calculations.

Stock-based
    Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted
    FAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“FAS 123R” or the “Statement”). The
    Statement requires all share-based payments to employees and
    non-employee directors to be

F-9


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expensed based on the grant date fair value of the awards over
    the requisite service period. The Company applied the
    requirements of FAS 123R using the modified prospective
    application transition method and therefore prior periods were
    not restated. Under the modified prospective method, the Company
    records compensation expense for (1) the unvested portion
    of previously issued awards that remained outstanding at the
    initial date of adoption and (2) for any awards issued,
    modified or settled after the effective date of the Statement.
    The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation method to determine
    the grant date fair value of its stock option awards.

Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company’s
    stock-based compensation was recognized using the intrinsic
    value method, which measures stock-based compensation expense as
    the amount at which the market price of the stock at the date of
    grant exceeds the exercise price. Accordingly, no compensation
    expense was recognized for the Company’s stock option
    awards. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the
    Company’s stock-based compensation expense consisted of
    restricted stock and service-based restricted stock unit and
    performance-based restricted stock unit awards, which were
    accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”).
    The effect of forfeitures on restricted stock and restricted
    stock units was recognized when such forfeitures occurred.

See Note 18 for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation and the adoption of FAS 123R.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less, including
    investments in debt securities. Investments in debt securities
    are diversified among high-credit quality securities in
    accordance with the Company’s risk-management policies, and
    primarily include commercial paper and money market funds.

Restricted
    Cash

The Company has placed €69.5 million
    ($109.8 million) of cash in escrow with certain banks,
    primarily in Fiscal 2007, as collateral to secure guarantees of
    a corresponding amount made by the banks to certain
    international tax authorities on behalf of the Company. Of the
    €69.5 million of cash in escrow,
    €39.7 million ($62.8 million) was placed as
    collateral to secure guarantees made to the French tax
    authorities for the payment of an asserted excess royalties tax
    matter and €29.8 million ($47.0 million) was
    placed as collateral to secure refunds of value-added tax
    payments in certain international tax jurisdictions. Such cash
    has been classified as restricted cash and reported as a
    component of other non-current assets in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets.

Short-term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company
    expects to convert into cash within one year, including time
    deposits which have a maturity greater than three months.
    Short-term investments are reported at cost, which approximates
    market value. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and
    purchase of short-term investments are classified as investing
    activities within proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments and purchases of investments, respectively, in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

Accounts
    Receivable

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to
    customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts
    receivable, net, as shown in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets, is net of certain reserves and allowances. These
    reserves and allowances consist of (a) reserves for
    returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns and operational
    chargebacks and (b) allowances for doubtful accounts. These
    reserves and allowances are discussed in further detail below.

A reserve for sales returns is determined based on an evaluation
    of current market conditions and historical returns experience.
    Charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A reserve for trade discounts is determined based on open
    invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers,
    and charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

Estimated end-of-season markdown charges are included as
    reductions of revenue. The related markdown provisions are based
    on retail sales performance, seasonal negotiations with
    customers, historical deduction trends and an evaluation of
    current market conditions.

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
    deductions by customers relating to individual shipments.
    Charges to increase this reserve, net of expected recoveries,
    are included as reductions of revenue. The reserve is based on
    actual notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and past
    experience.

A rollforward of the activity in the Company’s reserves for
    returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns and operational

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

In its wholesale business, the Company has two key
    department-store customers that generate significant sales
    volume. For Fiscal 2008, these two customers contributed
    approximately 24% and 12% of all wholesale revenues.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

POLO

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning product and all fashion
    product. Estimated realizable value of distressed inventory is
    determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of
    the Company’s individual product lines for this category of
    inventory, the impact of market trends and economic conditions,
    and the value of current orders in-house relating to the future
    sales of this category of inventory. Estimates may differ from
    actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in
    inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market
    conditions. The Company’s historical estimates of these
    costs and its provisions have not differed materially from
    actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.

Investments

Investments in companies in which the Company has significant
    influence, but less than a controlling voting interest, are
    accounted for using the equity method. This is generally
    presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of
    the investee. However, as a matter of policy, if the Company had
    a greater than 50% ownership interest in an investee and the
    minority shareholders held certain rights that allowed them to
    participate in the day-to-day operations of the business, the
    Company would also generally use the equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, only the Company’s investment in
    and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in
    the consolidated balance sheets; only the Company’s share
    of the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in the
    consolidated operating results; and only the dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the investee
    and additional cash investments, loan repayments or other cash
    paid to the investee are included in the consolidated cash flows.

Investments in companies in which the Company does not have a
    controlling interest, or is unable to exert significant
    influence, are accounted for as available-for-sale investments
    and, if the investments are publicly traded and there are no
    resale restrictions greater than one year, recorded at market
    value. If resale restrictions greater than one year exist, or if
    the investment is not publicly traded, the investment is
    accounted for at cost.

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss
    positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly
    basis. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations,
    including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with
    general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting
    specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include
    (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair
    value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition,
    credit worthiness and near-term prospects of the issuer,
    (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) future
    economic conditions and market forecasts and (v) the
    Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value.
    The Company has not recognized any other-than-temporary
    impairment charges in any of the fiscal years presented.

Equity-method
    Investments

As of March 29, 2008, the Company’s investments
    include a joint venture named the Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry
    Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL Watch Company”), formed
    with Financiere Richemont SA (“Richemont”), the Swiss
    Luxury Goods Group, in March 2007. The joint venture is a Swiss
    corporation, whose purpose is to design, develop, manufacture,
    sell and distribute luxury watches and fine jewelry through
    Ralph Lauren boutiques, as well as through fine independent
    jewelry and luxury watch retailers throughout the world. The
    Company accounts for its 50% interest in the RL Watch Company
    under the equity method of accounting, and such investment is
    classified in other non-current assets in the consolidated
    balance sheet as of March 29, 2008. Royalty payments due to
    the Company under the related license agreement for use of
    certain of the Company’s trademarks are reflected as
    licensing revenue within the consolidated statement of
    operations. The RL Watch Company commenced operations during the
    first quarter of Fiscal 2008 and it is currently expected that
    products will be launched in the spring of calendar 2009.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of March 31, 2007, the Company’s only significant
    investment was an approximate 20% equity interest in Impact 21.
    Impact 21 was a public company that held the sublicenses for the
    Company’s men’s, women’s and jeans businesses in
    Japan. The Company accounted for its interest in Impact 21 using
    the equity method of accounting, and such investment was
    classified in other non-current assets in the consolidated
    balance sheet as of March 31, 2007. See Note 5 for
    further discussion of the Company’s Japanese Business
    Acquisitions, including Impact 21, that occurred in May 2007.

Available-for-sale
    Investments

As of March 29, 2008, investments also consisted of auction
    rate securities at a fair value of $14.5 million with reset
    periods generally ranging from 7 to 49 days. Auction rate
    securities have characteristics similar to short-term
    investments because, at pre-determined short-term intervals,
    there is a new auction process at which the interest rates for
    these securities are reset to current interest rates. At the end
    of such periods, the Company chooses to either roll over its
    holdings or seeks to redeem the investments for cash.
    Notwithstanding these short-term characteristics, the Company
    has classified these securities as non-current within other
    assets in its consolidated balance sheet as current market
    conditions call into question its ability to redeem these
    investments for cash within the next twelve months. Auction rate
    securities are categorized as available-for-sale investments and
    are stated at market value. Unrealized gains or losses are
    classified as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and
    related realized gains or losses are classified as a component
    of interest and other income, net, in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of operations. Cash inflows and outflows
    related to the sale and purchase of investments are classified
    as investing activities within proceeds from sales and
    maturities of investments and purchases of investments,
    respectively, in the Company’s consolidated statement of
    cash flows.

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture,
    fixtures, computer software and computer equipment; from three
    to ten years for machinery and equipment; and from ten to forty
    years for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are
    depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
    the respective assets or the life of the lease.

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“FAS 144”). In evaluating
    long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-lived
    intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best
    estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of
    the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that
    estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the
    asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is
    recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of
    such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for
    which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the
    lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (“FAS 142”). At acquisition, the Company
    estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible
    assets, which primarily consists of license agreements, customer
    relationships, non-compete agreements and order backlog. The
    fair value of these intangible assets is estimated based on
    management’s assessment, as well as independent third party
    appraisals, when necessary. The excess of the purchase
    consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is
    recorded as goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill, including
    any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain
    other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives
    are not amortized. Rather,

F-13


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are
    assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons
    of their respective fair values to their carrying values.
    Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their
    respective estimated useful lives and, along with other
    long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment
    periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. See discussion of
    the Company’s accounting policy for long-lived asset
    impairment as described earlier under the caption
    “

Property and Equipment, Net.

”

Officers’
    Life Insurance Policies

The Company maintains several whole-life and certain
    split-dollar life insurance policies for select senior
    executives. Whole-life policies are recorded at their
    cash-surrender value, and split-dollar policies are recorded at
    the lesser of their cash-surrender value or aggregate premiums
    paid-to-date in the consolidated balance sheets. As of the end
    of Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, amounts of approximately
    $48 million and $53 million, respectively, relating to
    officers’ life insurance policies held by the Company were
    classified within other non-current assets in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes” (“FAS 109”). Under this method,
    income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current
    taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded
    based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and
    include the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax
    reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of
    certain net operating loss, capital loss and general business
    credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amount of assets and
    liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as
    determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company
    accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or
    rates in the period of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when
    management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some
    portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

Effective April 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — An Interpretation of
    FAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”). Upon the
    adoption of the provisions of FIN 48, the Company changed
    its policy related to the accounting for income tax
    uncertainties. If the Company considers that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
    recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit
    by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains
    assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the
    Company’s estimates change or the final tax outcome of
    these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such
    differences will impact the income tax provision in the period
    in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment
    fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company
    regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the
    tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or
    analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of
    prevailing on the technical merits of the position to
    more-likely-than-not, (ii) the statute of limitations
    expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an audit
    resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate
    agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only
    when the Company expects to pay cash within the next twelve
    months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded within the
    provision for income taxes in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated
    balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits.

See Note 12 for further discussion of the Company’s
    income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48.

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment, including
    its retail stores. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for
    under the provisions of FAS No. 13, “Accounting
    for Leases” and other related authoritative accounting
    literature (“FAS 13”). Certain of the
    Company’s leases contain renewal options, rent escalation
    clauses

and/or

landlord incentives. Rent expense for noncancelable operating
    leases with scheduled rent increases

and/or

landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement
    date. The excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled
    payment amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a
    deferred rent liability. As of the end of Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal
    2007, deferred rent obligations of approximately
    $112 million and $96 million, respectively, were
    classified within other non-current liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

For leases in which the Company is involved with the
    construction of the building (generally on land owned by the
    landlord), the Company accounts for the lease during the
    construction period under the provisions of EITF

No. 97-10,

“The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset
    Construction”

(“EITF 97-10”).

If the Company concludes that it has substantively all of the
    risks of ownership during construction of a leased property and
    therefore is deemed the owner of the project for accounting
    purposes, it records an asset and related financing obligation
    for the amount of total project costs related to

construction-in-progress

and the pre-existing building. Once construction is complete,
    the Company considers the requirements under
    FAS No. 98, “Accounting for Leases:
    Sale-Leaseback Transactions Involving Real Estate, Sales-Type
    Leases of Real Estate, Definition of Lease Term, and Initial
    Direct Costs of Direct Financing Leases,” for
    sale-leaseback treatment. If the arrangement does not qualify
    for sale-leaseback treatment, the Company continues to amortize
    the financing obligation and depreciate the building over the
    lease term.

Derivatives
    and Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance
    with FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and subsequent
    amendments (collectively, “FAS 133”).
    FAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition,
    FAS 133 provides that, for derivative instruments that
    qualify for hedge accounting, the effective portion of changes
    in the fair value are either (a) offset against the changes
    in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
    commitments through earnings or (b) recognized in
    stockholders’ equity until the hedged item is recognized in
    earnings, depending on whether the derivative is being used to
    hedge changes in fair value or cash flows, respectively.

Each derivative instrument entered into by the Company which
    qualifies for hedge accounting is considered highly effective at
    reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. For
    each derivative designated as a hedge, the Company formally
    documents the risk management objective and strategy, including
    the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item
    and the risk exposure, as well as how effectiveness is to be
    assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess
    effectiveness, the Company uses non-statistical methods,
    including the dollar-offset method, that compare the change in
    the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value
    or cash flows of the hedged item. The extent to which a hedging
    instrument has been and is expected to continue to be effective
    at achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is
    assessed and documented by the Company at least on a quarterly
    basis. Any ineffectiveness in hedging relationships is
    recognized immediately in earnings. If it is determined that a
    derivative has not been highly effective, and will continue not
    to be highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge
    accounting is discontinued.

All undesignated hedges of the Company are entered into to hedge
    specific economic risks. The Company does not enter into
    derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
    Changes in fair value relating to undesignated derivative
    instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is
    exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts
    will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, the

Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with
    carefully selected financial institutions based upon their
    credit ratings and certain other financial factors. The
    Company’s established policies and procedures for
    mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include
    reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.

For cash flow reporting purposes, the Company classifies
    proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a
    derivative instrument in the same manner as the related item
    being hedged.

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments
    approximates fair value, except for certain differences relating
    to fixed-rate debt, investments in other entities accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting and other financial
    instruments. However, other than differences in the fair value
    of fixed-rate debt as disclosed in Note 13, these
    differences were not significant as of March 29, 2008 or
    March 31, 2007. The fair value of financial instruments
    generally is determined by reference to market values resulting
    from the trading of the instruments on a national securities
    exchange or an over-the-counter market. In cases where quoted
    market prices are not available, fair value is based on
    estimates derived through the use of present value or other
    valuation techniques.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008
    (April 1, 2007). See Note 12 for further discussion of
    the Company’s income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48.

Financial
    Statement Misstatements

In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 was issued in order to
    eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public
    companies quantify and evaluate financial statement
    misstatements.

Traditionally, there have been two widely-recognized methods for
    quantifying and evaluating the effects of financial statement
    misstatements: (i) the balance sheet (“iron
    curtain”) method and (ii) the income statement
    (“rollover”) method. The iron curtain method
    quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the
    misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the
    reporting period. The rollover method quantifies a misstatement
    based on the amount of the error originating in the current
    period income statement, including the reversing effect of prior
    year misstatements. The use of the rollover method can lead to
    the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet. Prior to
    the adoption of SAB 108, the Company historically used the
    rollover method for quantifying and evaluating identified
    financial statement misstatements.

By issuing SAB 108, the SEC staff established an approach
    that requires quantification and evaluation of financial
    statement misstatements based on the effects of the
    misstatements under both the iron curtain and rollover methods.
    This model is commonly referred to as a “dual
    approach.”

SAB 108 required companies to initially apply its
    provisions either by (i) restating prior financial
    statements as if the dual approach had always been applied or
    (ii) recording the cumulative effect of initially applying
    the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal
    year, with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening
    balance of retained earnings. The Company adopted the provisions
    of SAB 108 in Fiscal 2007 and elected to record the effects
    of applying SAB 108 using the cumulative effect transition
    method and, as such, recorded a $16.9 million reduction in
    retained earnings as of April 2, 2006.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R and, in March
    2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
    (“SAB 107”). SAB 107 provides implementation
    guidance for companies to use in their adoption of
    FAS 123R. FAS 123R supersedes both APB 25, which
    permitted the use of the intrinsic-value method in accounting
    for stock-based compensation, and FAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended
    by FAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”
    (“FAS 123”), which allowed companies applying APB
    25 to just disclose in their financial statements the pro forma
    effect on net income from applying the fair-value method of
    accounting for stock-based compensation. The Company adopted
    FAS 123R as of April 2, 2006. See Note 18 for
    further discussion of the Company’s stock-based
    compensation and the adoption of FAS 123R.

Other
    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“FAS 161”). FAS 161 amends
    FAS 133 to provide enhanced disclosure requirements
    surrounding how and why an entity uses derivative instruments,
    how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under FAS 133 and how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
    position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is
    effective for the Company as of the beginning of Fiscal 2010,
    including interim periods thereafter. The implementation of
    FAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141R”),
    which replaces FAS No. 141. FAS 141R was issued
    to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial
    reporting of business combinations, resulting in more complete,
    comparable and relevant information for investors and other
    users of financial statements. FAS 141R establishes
    principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business
    combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the
    goodwill acquired. Significant changes from current practice
    resulting from FAS 141R include the need for the acquirer
    to record 100% of all assets and liabilities of the acquired
    business, including goodwill, generally at their fair values for
    all business combinations (whether partial, full or step
    acquisitions); the need to recognize contingent consideration at
    its fair value on the acquisition date and, for certain
    arrangements, to recognize changes in fair value in earnings
    until settlement; and the need to expense acquisition-related
    transaction and restructuring costs rather than to treat them as
    part of the cost of the acquisition. FAS 141R also
    establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate
    the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    FAS 141R is effective for the Company as of the beginning
    of Fiscal 2010 and will be applied prospectively to business
    combinations that close on or after March 29, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an Amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“FAS 160”). FAS 160 establishes accounting
    and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests (previously
    referred to as “minority interests”) in a subsidiary
    and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary, to ensure
    consistency with the requirements of FAS 141R.
    FAS 160 states that noncontrolling interests should be
    classified as a separate component of equity, and establishes
    reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that
    clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the
    parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners.
    FAS 160 is effective for the Company as of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2010 and will be applied prospectively to business
    combinations that close on or after March 29, 2009. The
    application of FAS 160 is not expected to have a material
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of
    FAS No. 115” (“FAS 159” or the
    “Standard”). FAS 159 permits companies to choose
    to measure, on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, financial instruments and certain other items at fair
    value that are not currently required to be measured at fair
    value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
    value option is elected will be recognized in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. The Company does not expect to elect
    the fair value option for any of its financial assets or
    financial liabilities upon adoption of the Standard in the
    beginning of Fiscal 2009. Therefore, the initial application of
    FAS 159 is not expected to have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”).
    FAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date. FAS 157 establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FAS 157 is
    effective for all financial assets and liabilities of the
    Company as of the beginning of Fiscal 2009, and is effective for
    all non-financial assets and liabilities of the Company as of
    the beginning of Fiscal 2010. The Company does not expect that
    the provisions of FAS 157 to be adopted in Fiscal 2009 will
    have a material effect on its consolidated financial

Acquisitions
    and Joint Ventures

Fiscal
    2008 Transactions

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company completed its previously
    announced transactions to acquire control of certain of its
    Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed
    arrangements, consistent with the Company’s long-term
    strategy of international expansion. In particular, the Company
    acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares of Impact
    21 that it did not previously own in a cash tender offer (the
    “Impact 21 Acquisition”), thereby increasing its
    ownership in Impact 21 from approximately 20% to approximately
    97%. Impact 21 conducts the Company’s men’s,
    women’s and jeans apparel and accessories business in Japan
    under a pre-existing, sub-license arrangement. In addition, the
    Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in PRL Japan, which
    holds the master license to conduct Polo’s business in
    Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu (the “PRL Japan
    Minority Interest Acquisition”). Collectively, the Impact
    21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition
    are herein referred to as the “Japanese Business
    Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately
    $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately
    $12 million. In January 2008, at an Impact
    21 shareholders meeting, the Company obtained the necessary
    approvals to complete the process of acquiring the remaining
    approximately 3% of outstanding shares not exchanged as of the
    close of the tender offer period (the “minority
    squeeze-out”). In February 2008, the Company acquired
    approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares
    outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. The Company
    expects the minority squeeze-out to be successfully concluded in
    the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, at an estimated aggregate cost
    of $9 million.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and ¥20.5 billion of borrowings
    under a one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment
    and restatement to the Company’s existing credit facility.
    The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on
    May 22, 2008 using approximately $200 million of
    Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as part of the
    acquisition.

Based on the nature of the successful public tender offer
    process for substantially all of the Impact 21 common stock
    previously not owned by the Company and the Company’s
    determination that the terms of the pre-existing licensing
    relationships were reflective of market, no settlement gain or
    loss was recognized in connection with the transaction. As such,
    based on valuation analyses prepared by an independent valuation
    firm, the Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged
    to the purchase of the Japanese businesses. The acquisition cost
    of approximately $365 million has been allocated on a
    preliminary basis to the net assets acquired based on their
    respective fair values as follows: cash of $189 million;
    trade receivables of $26 million; inventory of
    $38 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
    $74 million (consisting of the re-acquired licenses of
    $21 million and customer relationships of
    $53 million); non-tax-deductible goodwill of
    $138 million; assumed pension liabilities of
    $5 million; net deferred tax liabilities of
    $31 million; and other net liabilities of $64 million.
    The Company is in the process of completing its assessment of
    the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for
    the allocation of the purchase price, including its assessment
    and formulation of plans associated with integrating the
    Japanese businesses into the Company’s current operations.
    As a result, the estimated purchase price allocation is subject
    to change.

The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    within minority interest expense the amount of Impact 21’s
    net income allocable to the holders of the approximate 80% of
    the Impact 21 shares not owned by the Company prior to the
    closing date of the

tender offer. The results of operations for PRL Japan have
    already been consolidated by the Company as described further in
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company also entered into a transition services agreement
    with Onward Kashiyama which, along with its affiliates, was a
    former approximate 41% shareholder of Impact 21, to provide a
    variety of operational, human resources and information
    systems-related services over a period of up to two years from
    the date of acquisition.

Acquisition
    of Small Leathergoods Business

On April 13, 2007, the Company acquired from Kellwood
    Company (“Kellwood”) substantially all of the assets
    of New Campaign, Inc., the Company’s licensee for
    men’s and women’s belts and other small leather goods
    under the

Ralph Lauren

,

Lauren

and

Chaps

brands in the U.S. (the “Small Leathergoods
    Business Acquisition”). The assets acquired from Kellwood
    are operated under the name of “Polo Ralph Lauren
    Leathergoods” and allowed the Company to further expand its
    accessories business. The acquisition cost was
    $10.4 million. Kellwood provided various transition
    services to the Company for a period of up to six months from
    the date of acquisition.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. As such, the
    Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition and no settlement gain
    or loss was recognized in connection with the transaction. The
    results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods
    business have been consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing April 1, 2007. In addition, the
    acquisition cost has been allocated as follows: inventory of
    $7.0 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
    $2.1 million (consisting of the re-acquired license of
    $1.3 million, customer relationships of $0.7 million
    and order backlog of $0.1 million); other net assets of
    $0.7 million; and tax-deductible goodwill of
    $0.6 million.

Formation
    of Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Joint Venture

In March 2007, the Company formed a joint venture with Richemont
    to design, develop, manufacture, sell and distribute luxury
    watches and fine jewelry. See Note 3 for further discussion
    of the Company’s joint venture.

Fiscal
    2007 Transactions

Acquisition
    of RL Media Minority Interest

On March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    equity interest in RL Media formerly held by NBC (37.5%) and
    Value Vision (12.5%) (the “RL Media Minority Interest
    Acquisition”). RL Media conducts the Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through the RalphLauren.com internet site. The
    results of operations for RL Media have already been
    consolidated by the Company as described further in Note 2
    to the consolidated financial statements. The acquisition cost
    was $175 million. In addition, Value Vision entered into a
    transition services agreement with the Company to provide order
    fulfillment and related services over a period of up to
    seventeen months from the date of the acquisition of the RL
    Media minority interest.

The Company evaluated the terms of all significant pre-existing
    relationships between itself and RL Media to determine if a
    settlement of the pre-existing relationships existed. In
    addition, the Company obtained valuation analyses of RL Media
    prepared by an independent valuation firm. Based on these
    analyses, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties
    under the RL Media partnership agreement, the Company determined
    that all of the consideration exchanged should be allocated to
    the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest. Accordingly,
    no settlement gain or loss was recognized in connection with
    this transaction.

The excess of the acquisition cost over the pre-existing
    minority interest liability of $33 million has been
    allocated as follows: inventory of $8 million; finite-lived
    intangible assets of $58 million (consisting of the
    re-acquired license of $56 million and customer list of
    $2 million); and tax-deductible goodwill of
    $76 million.

Supplemental
    Pro Forma Information

The following unaudited condensed pro forma information (herein
    referred to as the “pro forma information”) assumes
    the Japanese Business Acquisitions, the RL Media Minority
    Interest Acquisition and the Small Leathergoods Business
    Acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008 and
    Fiscal 2007 for the applicable fiscal years presented. The pro
    forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes
    only and is not necessarily indicative of the actual results
    that would have been attained had the acquisitions occurred as
    of the beginning of the fiscal years presented, nor is it
    indicative of the Company’s future results. Furthermore,
    the unaudited pro forma information does not reflect
    management’s estimate of any revenue-enhancing
    opportunities nor anticipated cost savings that may occur as a
    result of the integration and consolidation of the acquisitions.

The pro forma information set forth below reflects nonrecurring
    charges related to (a) the amortization of the

write-ups

to
    fair value of inventory included within cost of goods sold as
    part of the preliminary purchase price allocations, which were
    fully recognized within six months of each respective
    acquisition date; (b) the amortization of the

write-up

to
    fair value of the acquired licenses as part of the preliminary
    purchase price allocation for the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions, which was fully amortized within nine months of
    the acquisition date; and (c) the write-off of foreign
    currency option contracts entered into to manage certain foreign
    currency exposures associated with the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions which expired unexercised during the first quarter
    of Fiscal 2008. These charges included in the Company’s pro

Fiscal
    2006 Transactions

Acquisition
    of Polo Jeans Business

On February 3, 2006, the Company acquired from Jones
    Apparel Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Jones”) all
    of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun
    Apparel, Inc., the Company’s licensee for men’s and
    women’s casual apparel and sportswear in the U.S. and
    Canada (the “Polo Jeans Business”). The acquisition
    cost was approximately $260 million, including transaction
    costs. In addition, simultaneous with the transaction, the
    Company settled all claims under its litigation with Jones for a
    cost of $100 million.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. However,
    because the Company simultaneously purchased a business and
    settled all pre-existing litigation, the aggregate consideration
    exchanged was required to be allocated for accounting purposes
    in proportion to the underlying fair values of the legal
    settlement and the Polo Jeans Business acquired. Based on the
    arm’s-length negotiation with Jones, the Company determined
    that the fair value of the legal settlement was
    $100 million, which equaled the amount of a litigation
    reserve initially established by the Company during Fiscal 2005.
    The remaining

$255 million of consideration exchanged was allocated to
    the Polo Jeans Business based on valuation analyses prepared by
    an independent valuation firm.

The results of operations for the Polo Jeans Business have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing February 4, 2006. In addition, the consolidated
    financial statements include the following allocation of the
    acquisition cost to the net assets acquired based on their
    respective fair values: inventory of $36 million;
    finite-lived intangible assets of $159 million (consisting
    of the re-acquired license of $97 million, customer
    relationships of $57 million and order backlog of
    $5 million); non-tax-deductible goodwill of
    $126 million; and deferred tax and other liabilities, net,
    of $61 million. Other than inventory, Jones retained the
    right to all working capital balances on the date of closing.

The Company also entered into a transition services agreement
    with Jones to provide a variety of operational, financial and
    information systems services over a period of six to twelve
    months from the date of the acquisition of the Polo Jeans
    Business.

Acquisition
    of Footwear Business

On July 15, 2005, the Company acquired from Reebok

    outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear

    women’s and children’s footwear, as well as certain
    foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok (collectively, the
    “Footwear Business”). The acquisition cost was
    approximately $112 million in cash, including
    $2 million of transaction costs. In addition, Reebok and
    certain of its affiliates entered into a transition services
    agreement with the Company to provide a variety of operational,
    financial and information systems services over a period of
    twelve to eighteen months from the date of the acquisition of
    the Footwear Business.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. As such, based
    on valuation analyses prepared by an independent valuation firm,
    the Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    purchase of the Footwear Business and no settlement gain or loss
    was recognized in connection with the transaction.

The results of operations for the Footwear Business for the
    period have been consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing July 16, 2005. In addition, the
    consolidated financial statements include the following
    allocation of the acquisition cost to the net assets acquired
    based on their respective fair values: trade receivables of
    $17 million; inventory of $26 million; finite-lived
    intangible assets of $62 million (consisting of the
    footwear license at $38 million, customer relationships at
    $23 million and order backlog at $1 million);
    tax-deductible goodwill of $20 million; other assets of
    $1 million; and liabilities of $14 million.

As discussed in Note 3, the Company periodically evaluates
    the recoverability of the carrying value of fixed assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    assets’ values may be impaired. During Fiscal 2008, the
    Company recorded impairment charges of $5.0 million to
    reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets in its
    Retail segment to their estimated fair value. These impairment
    charges were primarily recorded as a result of

lower-than-expected

operating cash flow performance for certain stores that, along
    with projections of future performance, indicated that the
    carrying values of the related fixed assets were not
    recoverable. No impairment charges were recorded in Fiscal 2007.
    During Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges of
    $10.8 million to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets
    to their estimated fair value, largely related to its Club
    Monaco retail business that included its Caban Concept and Club
    Monaco factory stores. This impairment charge primarily related
    to lower-than-expected store performance and preceded the
    Company’s implementation of a plan to restructure these
    operations in February 2006. In measuring the amount of these
    impairments, fair value was determined based on discounted
    expected cash flows. See Note 11 for further discussion of
    the Club Monaco restructuring plan and related charges.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 3, the Company accounts for goodwill
    and other intangible assets in accordance with FAS 142.
    Under FAS 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets
    deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized.
    Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are
    subject to annual impairment testing. Finite-lived intangible
    assets continue to be amortized over their respective estimated
    useful lives. Based on the results of the Company’s annual
    impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets in Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, no
    impairment charges were deemed necessary.

Restructuring

The Company has recorded restructuring liabilities in recent
    years relating to various cost-savings initiatives, as well as
    certain of its acquisitions. In accordance with US GAAP,
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition
    are capitalized as part of the purchase accounting for the
    transaction. Such acquisition-related restructuring costs were
    not material in any period. Liabilities for costs associated
    with non-acquisition-related restructuring initiatives are
    expensed and initially measured at fair value when incurred in
    accordance with US GAAP. A description of the nature of
    significant non-acquisition-related restructuring activities and
    related costs is presented below.

Fiscal
    2007 Restructuring

In connection with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan described
    below, during Fiscal 2007 the Company ultimately decided to
    close all of Club Monaco’s Caban Concept Stores (the
    “Caban Stores”) and recognized $4.0 million of
    associated restructuring charges, primarily relating to lease
    termination costs. The remaining liability under the plan was
    $0.9 million as of March 29, 2008.

Additionally, the Company recognized $0.6 million of other
    restructuring charges primarily related to severance costs
    associated with the transition of certain sourcing and
    production functions from Colombia to the U.S. during
    Fiscal 2007.

Fiscal
    2006 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company committed
    to a plan to restructure its Club Monaco retail business. In
    particular, this plan consisted of the closure of all five Club
    Monaco factory stores and the intention to dispose of by sale or
    closure all eight of the Caban Stores (collectively, the
    “Club Monaco Restructuring Plan”). In connection with
    this plan, an aggregate restructuring-related charge of
    $12 million was recognized in Fiscal 2006. This charge
    consisted of (a) a $3 million writedown of inventory
    to estimated net realizable value, which has been classified as
    a component of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements
    of operations, (b) a $5 million writedown of fixed and
    other net assets, which has been classified as a component of
    restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of
    operations and (c) the recognition of a $4 million
    liability relating to lease termination costs, which has been
    classified as a component of restructuring charges in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

There were no significant restructuring charges recognized by
    the Company during Fiscal 2008.

POLO

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has available federal, state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards of $0.9 million,
    $5.4 million and $11.6 million, respectively, for tax
    purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss
    carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal 2009. The utilization
    of the federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to
    the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which
    applies following certain changes in ownership of the entity
    generating the loss carryforward.

Also, the Company has available state and foreign net operating
    loss carryforwards of $7.9 million and $1.2 million,
    respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been
    recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded since
    management does not believe that the Company will more likely
    than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future
    taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax
    assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such
    recognition.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign
    taxes on $418.0 million of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings have been and are expected
    to continue to be reinvested. These earnings could become
    subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign
    earnings were lent to Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation
    (“PRLC”), a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of
    PRLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries were sold.
    Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
    liability with respect to such earnings is not practical.
    Management believes that the amount of the additional taxes that
    might be payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if
    remitted, would be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax
    credits.

Uncertain
    Income Tax Benefits

Impact of
    FIN 48 Adoption

As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized a $62.5 million reduction in retained earnings
    as the cumulative effect to adjust its net liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits as of April 1, 2007. This
    adjustment consisted of a $99.9 million increase to the
    Company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, offset
    in part by a $37.4 million increase to the Company’s
    deferred tax assets principally representing the value of future
    tax benefits that could be realized at the U.S. federal
    level if the related liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
    at the state and local levels ultimately are required to be
    settled. The total balance of unrecognized tax benefits,
    including interest and penalties, was $173.8 million as of
    April 1, 2007. The total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s
    effective tax rate was $123.4 million as of April 1,
    2007.

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as part of its provision for income
    taxes. Accordingly, included in the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits is a liability for interest and penalties in the
    amount of $45.7 million as of April 1, 2007.

    included within non-current liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits in the consolidated balance sheet. The total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the
    Company’s effective tax rate was $123.6 million as of
    March 29, 2008.

Future
    Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the
    Company’s tax positions is subject to change based on
    future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of
    ongoing audits

and/or

the
    expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the
    outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, it is
    reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax
    benefits, excluding interest and penalties, could potentially be
    reduced by up to approximately $40 million during the next
    12 months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected
    outcomes and timing of those events could cause the
    Company’s current estimate to change materially in the
    future.

The Company files tax returns in the U.S. federal and
    various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. With few
    exceptions for those tax returns, the Company is no longer
    subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for
    years prior to Fiscal 2000.

The Company has a credit facility that provides for a
    $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through
    November 2011 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
    Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of March 29, 2008, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility, but the Company was
    contingently liable for $23.0 million of outstanding
    letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase
    commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its
    borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the
    agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
    facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory
    reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the
    Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility
    (“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the
    Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to
    Consolidated EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”), as such
    terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of March 29,
    2008, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to
    the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s
    Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenant described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of
    Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities fail
    to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power
    of the Company’s common stock.

The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22,
    2007 to provide for the addition of a ¥20.5 billion
    loan (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan was made to Polo
    JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and was
    guaranteed by the Company, as well as the other subsidiaries of
    the Company which currently guarantee the Credit Facility. The
    proceeds of the Term Loan were used to finance the Japanese
    Business Acquisitions. Borrowings under the Term Loan bore
    interest at a fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the

borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using
    approximately $200 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand
    acquired as part of the acquisition. See Note 5 for further
    discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

Fair
    Value of Debt

Based on the prevailing level of market interest rates as of
    March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, the carrying value
    of the Company’s 2006 Euro Debt exceeded its fair value by
    approximately $50 million and $4 million,
    respectively. As of March 31, 2008, the carrying value of
    the Company’s Term Loan approximated its fair value.
    Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not result in the
    realization or expenditure of cash, unless the debt is retired
    prior to its maturity.

14.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company primarily has exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash
    flows from its international operations and possible declines in
    the fair value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign
    operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, the Company periodically uses derivative financial
    instruments to manage such risks.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following is a summary of the Company’s risk management
    strategies and the effect of those strategies on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts —
    General

The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange rate
    fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty
    payments made by certain of its international operations,
    intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing
    efforts of its international operations, other foreign
    currency-denominated operational obligations including payroll,
    rent, insurance, and benefit payments, and foreign
    currency-denominated revenues. As part of its overall strategy
    to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of
    the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British
    Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign
    currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve-month to
    two-year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency
    exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three
    months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout
    the hedging period.

The Company records the above described foreign currency
    exchange contracts at fair value in its consolidated balance
    sheets. Foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash
    flow hedges at hedge inception are accounted for in accordance
    with FAS 133. As such, to the extent these hedges are
    effective the related gains or losses are deferred in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are then
    recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as
    follows:

•

Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as part of the
    cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold
    when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments

and

Marketing
    Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency
    gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Operational Obligations

— Recognized primarily
    within SG&A expenses in the period in which the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings.

To the extent that any of these foreign currency exchange
    contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in
    offsetting the change in the value of the hedged item, any
    changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are
    immediately recognized in earnings. If a hedge relationship is
    terminated, the change in fair value of the derivative recorded
    in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in
    earnings when the hedged cash flows are expended or received,
    consistent with the original hedging strategy. In addition,
    changes in fair value relating to undesignated foreign currency
    exchange contracts are immediately recognized in earnings.

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that
    $17.9 million of net losses deferred in accumulated other
    comprehensive income related to general foreign currency
    exchange contracts outstanding as of March 29, 2008 will be
    recognized in earnings. The Company recognized a net loss on
    foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of approximately
    $8 million for Fiscal 2008, and net gains of approximately
    $4 million and $5 million for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal
    2006, respectively.

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts — Other

On October 10, 2007, the Company entered into a foreign
    exchange contract to purchase €13.5 million at a fixed
    rate. This contract hedges the foreign currency exposure related
    to the annual Euro interest payment due on October 6, 2008
    for Fiscal 2009 in connection with the Company’s
    outstanding 2006 Euro Debt. In accordance with FAS 133, the
    contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge. Since neither
    the terms of the hedge contract or the underlying exposure have
    changed, the related gains of $0.7 million have been
    reclassified from stockholders’ equity to foreign currency
    gains (losses) within our consolidated statement of operations
    to offset the related transaction loss arising from the
    remeasurement of the associated foreign currency-denominated
    accrued interest liability, as permitted by FAS 133, during
    Fiscal 2008.

On April 2, 2007, the Company entered into a similar
    foreign exchange contract to purchase €13.5 million at
    a fixed rate, hedging the foreign currency exposure related to
    the annual Euro interest payment made on October 4, 2007
    for Fiscal 2008. This contract also was designated as a cash
    flow hedge. Consistent with the accounting treatment discussed
    above, the related gains of $1.1 million were reclassified
    from stockholders’ equity to foreign currency gains
    (losses) within our consolidated statement of operations during
    Fiscal 2008.

During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company entered
    into foreign currency option contracts with a notional value of
    $159 million giving the Company the right, but not the
    obligation, to purchase foreign currencies at fixed rates by
    May 23, 2007. These contracts hedged the majority of the
    foreign currency exposure related to the financing of the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions, but did not qualify under
    FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. The Company did not
    exercise any of the contracts and recognized a loss of
    $1.6 million within foreign currency gains (losses) in our
    consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2008.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, the
    Company entered into a foreign currency exchange contract with a
    notional value of $5 million hedging the foreign currency
    exposure related to an intercompany term loan provided by PRLC
    to Ralph Lauren Retail Japan (“RLRJ”) in connection
    with the Japanese Business Acquisitions minority squeeze-out, as
    discussed in Note 5. This contract, which hedges the
    foreign currency exposure related to a Yen-denominated payment
    to be made by RLRJ during the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, did
    not qualify under FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment.
    As such, the Company recognized a related loss of
    $0.4 million within foreign currency gains (losses) in our
    consolidated statement of operations during Fiscal 2008.

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that
    $0.7 million of net gains deferred in accumulated other
    comprehensive income related to the October 10, 2007 fixed
    rate foreign exchange contract outstanding as of March 29,
    2008 will be recognized in earnings. A total of
    $1.8 million has been reclassified from stockholders’
    equity to foreign currency gains (losses) in Fiscal 2008. No
    related gains (losses) were recognized by the Company in Fiscal
    2007 or Fiscal 2006.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company designated the entire principal amount of its
    outstanding 2006 Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries. As required by
    FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative
    instrument or a non-derivative financial instrument (such as
    debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a
    foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a
    translation adjustment under FAS No. 52, “Foreign
    Currency Translation,” to the extent it is effective as a
    hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the 2006 Euro Debt
    resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and
    continue to be, reported in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company
    recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income the
    translation effects of the 2006 Euro Debt to U.S. dollars,
    resulting in aggregate net losses of $45.4 million for
    Fiscal 2008 and $24.5 million for Fiscal 2007, and an
    aggregate net gain of $4.2 million for Fiscal 2006.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

Historically, the Company has used floating-rate interest rate
    swap agreements to hedge changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate 1999 Euro Debt. These interest swap agreements, which
    effectively converted fixed interest rate payments on the
    Company’s 1999 Euro Debt to a floating-rate basis, were
    designated as a fair value hedge in accordance with
    FAS 133. All interest rate swap agreements were terminated
    in late Fiscal 2006 and there were no outstanding agreements at
    the end of any fiscal year presented.

During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered
    into three forward-starting interest rate swap contracts
    aggregating €200 million notional amount of
    indebtedness in anticipation of the Company’s proposed
    refinancing of the 1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in
    October 2006. The Company designated these agreements as a cash
    flow hedge of a forecasted transaction to issue new debt in
    connection with the planned refinancing of its 1999 Euro Debt.
    The interest rate swaps hedged a total of
    €200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest
    rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of
    the three interest swap contracts, the Company paid a
    weighted-average fixed rate of interest of 4.1% and received
    variable interest based upon six-month EURIBOR. The Company
    terminated the swaps on September 28, 2006, which was the
    date the interest rate for the 2006 Euro Debt was determined. As
    a result, the Company made a payment of approximately
    €3.5 million ($4.4 million based on the exchange
    rate in effect on that date) in settlement of the swaps. An
    amount of $0.2 million was recognized as a loss for the
    three months ending September 30, 2006 due to the partial
    ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result of the
    forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006 instead
    of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999 Euro
    Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million has been deferred
    as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity and is being recognized in earnings as an adjustment to
    interest expense over the seven-year term of the 2006 Euro Debt.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

The Company operates its retail stores under various leasing
    arrangements. The Company also occupies various office and
    warehouse facilities and uses certain equipment under numerous
    lease agreements. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for
    under the provisions of FAS 13 as either operating leases
    or capital leases. In this context, capital leases include
    leases whereby the Company is considered to have the substantive
    risks of ownership during construction of a leased property
    pursuant to the provisions of

EITF 97-10.

Information on the Company’s operating and capital leasing
    activities is set forth below.

Operating
    Leases

The Company is typically required to make minimum rental
    payments, and often contingent rental payments, under its
    operating leases. Substantially all factory and full-price
    retail store leases provide for contingent rentals based upon
    sales, and certain rental agreements require payment based
    solely on a percentage of sales. Terms of the Company’s
    leases generally contain renewal options, rent escalation
    clauses and landlord incentives. Rent expense, net of sublease
    income which was not significant, was approximately
    $208 million in Fiscal 2008, $172 million in Fiscal
    2007 and $137 million in Fiscal 2006. Such amounts include
    contingent rental charges of approximately $14 million for
    Fiscal 2008, and approximately $12 million for both Fiscal
    2007 and Fiscal 2006. In addition to such amounts, the Company
    is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs
    relating to the leased real estate properties.

Litigation

Credit
    Card Matters

The Company is subject to various claims relating to allegations
    of security breaches in certain of its retail store information
    systems. These claims have been made by various credit card
    issuers, issuing banks and credit card processors with respect
    to cards issued by them pursuant to the rules imposed by certain
    credit card issuers, particularly
    Visa

®

and
    MasterCard

®

.
    The allegations include fraudulent credit card charges, the cost
    of replacing credit cards, related monitoring expenses and other
    related claims.

In Fiscal 2005, the Company was subject to various claims
    relating to an alleged security breach of its point-of-sale
    systems that occurred at certain Polo retail stores in the
    U.S. The Company had previously recorded a reserve for an
    aggregate amount of $13 million to provide for its best
    estimate of losses related to these claims. The Company
    ultimately paid approximately $11 million in settlement of
    these various claims and the eligibility period for filing any
    such claims has expired.

In addition, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company
    was notified of an alleged compromise of its retail store
    information systems that process its credit card data for
    certain Club Monaco stores in Canada. As of the end of Fiscal
    2007, the Company had recorded a total reserve of
    $5.0 million for this matter based on its best estimate of
    exposure at that time. While the final settlement of this matter
    is pending approval by the credit card issuers, the
    Company’s Canadian credit card processor returned
    three-quarters of the funds previously escrowed to cover
    potential claims by the end of April 2008. Accordingly, based on
    the progress in this matter and the available evidence to date,
    the Company reversed $4.1 million of its original
    $5.0 million reserve into income during Fiscal 2008. The
    Company was also recently advised that the Quebec Privacy
    Commission has ceased its investigation of Club Monaco in
    connection with this matter.

The Company is cooperating with law enforcement authorities in
    both the U.S. and Canada in their investigations of these
    matters.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd.
    (“Wathne”), our domestic licensee for luggage and
    handbags, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in
    the Southern District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren,
    our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other
    things, federal trademark law violations, breach of contract,
    breach of obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and
    negligent misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other
    relief, injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. We believe this lawsuit to be without
    merit, and moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims.
    Wathne cross-moved for partial summary judgment. A hearing on
    these motions occurred on November 1, 2007. The judge
    presiding in this case provided a written ruling on the summary
    judgment motion on April 11, 2008. The Court granted
    Polo’s summary judgment motion to dismiss in large measure,
    and denied Wathne’s cross-motion. Wathne has appealed the
    dismissal of its claims. A trial date has not yet been
    established in connection with this matter. We intend to
    continue to contest the few remaining claims in this lawsuit
    vigorously. Accordingly, management does not expect that the
    ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

    on July 19, 2001, the USPA and Jordache filed a lawsuit
    against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York. This suit, which was effectively a
    counterclaim by them in connection with the original trademark
    action, asserted claims related to our actions in connection
    with our pursuit of claims against the USPA and Jordache for
    trademark infringement and other unlawful conduct. Their claims
    stemmed from our contacts with the USPA’s and
    Jordache’s retailers in which we informed these retailers
    of our position in the original trademark action. All claims and
    counterclaims, except for our claims that the defendants
    violated the Company’s trademark rights, were settled in
    September 2003. We did not pay any damages in this settlement.

On July 30, 2004, the Court denied all motions for summary
    judgment, and trial began on October 3, 2005 with respect
    to the four “double horseman” symbols that the
    defendants sought to use. On October 20, 2005, the jury
    rendered a verdict, finding that one of the defendant’s
    marks violated our world famous Polo Player Symbol trademark and
    enjoining its further use, but allowing the defendants to use
    the remaining three marks. On November 16, 2005, we filed a
    motion before the trial court to overturn the jury’s
    decision and hold a new trial with respect to the three marks
    that the jury found not to be infringing. The USPA and Jordache
    opposed our motion, but did not move to overturn the jury’s
    decision that the fourth double horseman logo did infringe on
    our trademarks. On July 7, 2006, the judge denied our
    motion to overturn the jury’s decision. On August 4,
    2006, the Company filed an appeal of the judge’s decision
    to deny the Company’s motion for a new trial to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On
    March 4, 2008, the Court of Appeals issued a decision
    affirming the judgment of the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York.

California
    Labor Law Litigation

On March 2, 2006, a former employee at our Club Monaco
    store in Los Angeles, California filed a lawsuit against us in
    the San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations of
    California wage and hour laws. The plaintiff purports to
    represent a class of Club Monaco store employees who allegedly
    have been injured by being improperly classified as exempt
    employees and thereby not receiving compensation for overtime
    and not receiving meal and rest breaks. The complaint seeks an
    unspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement of
    profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. We believe
    this suit is without merit and intend to contest it vigorously.
    Accordingly, management does not expect that the ultimate
    resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs
    purport to represent a class of employees who allegedly have
    been injured by not properly being paid commission earnings, not
    being paid overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to
    work off of the clock while waiting to enter or leave the store
    and being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave the store.
    The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory
    damages, damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of
    profits, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    and declaratory relief. We have filed a cross-claim against one
    of the plaintiffs for his role in allegedly assisting a former
    employee misappropriate Company property. Subsequent to
    answering the complaint, we had the action moved to the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California.
    We believe this suit is without merit and intend to contest it
    vigorously. Accordingly, management does not expect that the
    ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

On August 21, 2007, eleven former and current employees of
    our Club Monaco stores in California filed a lawsuit in Los
    Angeles Superior Court alleging similar claims as the Club
    Monaco action in San Francisco. The complaint seeks an
    unspecified amount of compensatory damages, attorney’s fees
    and punitive damages. We

Other
    Matters

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims and

    intellectual property, licensing, employee relations and other
    matters incidental to our business. We believe that the

    individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect

Stockholders’
    Equity

Capital
    Stock

The Company’s capital stock consists of two classes of
    common stock. There are 500 million shares of Class A
    common stock and 100 million shares of Class B common
    stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and
    Class B common stock have substantially identical rights,
    except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A
    common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of
    Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share.
    Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class
    on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval,
    except with respect to the election and removal of directors or
    as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares
    of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

In August 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    an expansion of the Company’s existing common stock
    repurchase program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to
    an additional $250 million of Class A common stock.
    Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject
    to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2008,
    6.1 million shares of Class A common stock were
    repurchased at a cost of $476.4 million under the expanded
    and pre-existing programs, including $24.0 million
    (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of
    the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. The
    remaining availability under the common stock repurchase program
    was approximately $142 million as of March 29, 2008.

In addition, during Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan.

In Fiscal 2007, share repurchases amounted to 3.5 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $231.3 million. In Fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased
    69.3 thousand shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $3.8 million.

Repurchased shares are accounted for as treasury stock at cost
    and will be held in treasury for future use.

In May 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
    further expansion of the Company’s existing common stock
    repurchase program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to
    an additional $250 million of Class A common stock.

Dividends

Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash
    dividend of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per share on an annual
    basis, on its common stock. Dividends paid amounted to
    $20.5 million in Fiscal 2008, $20.9 million in Fiscal
    2007 and $20.8 million in Fiscal 2006.

Stock-based
    Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted FAS 123R
    using the modified prospective application transition method.
    Under this transition method, the compensation expense
    recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
    beginning April 2, 2006 includes compensation expense for
    (a) all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
    vested as of, April 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    FAS 123 and (b) all stock-based payments granted
    subsequent to April 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    FAS 123R.

Prior to the adoption of
    FAS 123R and in accordance with existing accounting
    principles, the Company recognized stock-based compensation
    expense in connection with both service-based and
    performance-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), as
    well as for shares of restricted stock.

Transition
    Information

Prior to April 2, 2006, the Company accounted for
    stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method
    in accordance with APB 25 and adopted the disclosure-only
    provisions of FAS 123. Under this standard, the Company did
    not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of stock
    options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the
    market price at the date of grant. However, as required, the
    Company disclosed, in the notes to the consolidated financial
    statements, the pro forma expense impact of the stock option
    grants as if the fair-value-based recognition provisions of
    FAS 123 were applied. Compensation expense was previously
    recognized for restricted stock and RSUs. The effect of
    forfeitures on restricted stock and RSUs was recognized when
    such forfeitures occurred.

In accordance with the modified prospective application
    transition method, prior period financial statements have not
    been restated to reflect the effects of implementing
    FAS 123R. The following table presents the Company’s
    pro forma net income and net income per share if compensation
    expense for fixed stock option grants had been determined based

Long-term
    Stock Incentive Plan

The Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as
    amended (the “1997 Plan”), authorizes the grant of
    awards to participants with respect to a maximum of
    26.0 million shares of the Company’s Class A
    common stock; however, there are limits as to the number of
    shares available for certain awards and to any one participant.
    Equity awards that may be made under the 1997 Plan include
    (a) stock options, (b) restricted stock and
    (c) RSUs. The Company also granted awards under the 1997
    Non-Employee Director Option Plan prior to that plan’s
    expiration on December 31, 2006. No future awards will be
    made under the 1997 Non-Employee Director Option Plan.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable ratably
    (a graded-vesting schedule), over a three-year vesting period.
    Stock options generally expire either seven or ten years from
    the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense
    for share-based awards that have graded vesting and no
    performance conditions on an accelerated basis.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
    estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires
    the input of subjective assumptions. The Company develops its
    assumptions primarily by analyzing the historical exercise
    behavior of employees and non-employee directors. The
    Company’s assumptions used for the fiscal years presented
    were as follows:

Expected Term

— The estimate of expected term
    is based on the historical exercise behavior of employees and
    non-employee directors, as well as the contractual life of the
    option grants.

Expected Volatility

— The expected volatility
    factor is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock for a period equal to the stock
    option’s expected term.

Expected Dividend Yield

— The expected dividend
    yield is based on the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05
    per share.

Risk-free Interest Rate

— The risk-free
    interest rate is determined using the implied yield for a traded
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the
    option’s expected term.

The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used to estimate
    the fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years
    presented were as follows:

Restricted
    Stock and RSUs

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based RSUs to certain of its senior executives
    and non-employee directors. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to such senior executives and other key
    executives, and certain other employees of the Company.

Restricted shares of Class A common stock, which entitle
    the holder to receive a specified number of shares of
    Class A common stock at the end of a vesting period, are
    accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. In addition,
    holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash
    dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the
    Company’s Class A common stock. Generally, restricted
    stock grants vest over a five-year period of time, subject to
    the executive’s continuing employment. Restricted stock
    shares granted to non-employee directors vest over a three-year
    period of time.

RSUs entitle the grantee to receive shares of Class A
    common stock at the end of a vesting period. Service-based RSUs
    are payable in shares of Class A common stock and generally
    vest over a five-year period of time, subject to the
    executive’s continuing employment. Performance-based RSUs
    also are payable in shares of Class A common stock and
    generally vest (a) upon the completion of a three-year
    period of time (cliff vesting), subject to the

employee’s continuing employment and the Company’s

    period or (b) ratably, over a three-year period of time

    employment during the applicable vesting period and the
    achievement by the Company of certain performance goals either
    (i) in each year of the vesting period for grants made
    prior to Fiscal 2008 or (ii) solely in the initial year of
    the vesting period for grants made in Fiscal 2008. In addition,
    holders of certain RSUs are entitled to receive dividend
    equivalents in the form of additional RSUs in connection with
    the payment of dividends on the Company’s Class A
    common stock. RSUs, including shares resulting from dividend
    equivalents paid on such units, are accounted for at fair value
    at the date of grant. The fair value of a restricted security is
    based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A common
    stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those
    restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend
    equivalents. Compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is
    recognized over the related service period when attainment of
    the performance goals is deemed probable.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Profit
    Sharing Retirement Savings Plans

The Company sponsors two defined contribution benefit plans
    covering substantially all eligible U.S. employees not
    covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include
    a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal
    Revenue Code. The Company makes discretionary contributions to
    the plans and contributes an amount equal to 50% of the first 6%
    of salary contributed by an employee.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is 100% vested in
    Company matching and discretionary contributions after five
    years of credited service. Contributions made by the Company
    under these plans approximated $6 million, $4 million
    and $5 million in Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006,
    respectively.

Supplemental
    Retirement Plan

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for
    certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the
    401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans are expected to
    be constrained by the operation of certain Internal Revenue Code
    limitations. These supplemental benefits vest over time and the
    related compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period. Amounts of $29 million and $26 million were
    accrued under these plans as of March 29, 2008 and
    March 31, 2007, respectively, and are reflected within
    other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheets. Total compensation expense recognized related to these
    benefits was $4 million, $3 million and
    $5 million in Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plans

The Company has deferred compensation arrangements for certain
    key executives which generally provide for payments upon
    retirement, death or termination of employment. The amounts
    accrued under these plans were approximately $2 million as
    of both March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, and are
    reflected within other non-current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense related
    to these compensation arrangements was $0.3 million in each
    of the three fiscal years presented. The Company funds a portion
    of these obligations through the establishment of trust accounts
    on behalf of the executives participating in the plans. The
    trust accounts are reflected within other assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Union
    Pension Plan

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is
    required to make contributions to the UNITE HERE (which was
    previously known as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
    Textile Employees, prior to its merger with the Hotel Employees
    and Restaurant Employees International Union)
    (“Union”) for dues based on wages paid to union
    employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to
    a retirement fund which provides defined benefits to
    substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not
    participate in the management of the plan and has not been
    furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits
    provided, vested and non-vested benefits or assets.

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a
    multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its
    proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits.
    Such withdrawal liability was assumed in conjunction with the
    acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee.
    The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the
    plan.

International
    Defined Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit
    plans and participates in certain multi-employer defined benefit
    plans at international locations, which are not considered to be
    material individually or in the aggregate as of March 29,
    2008. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas
    that reflect the

F-45


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

employees’ years of service and compensation levels during
    their employment period. The aggregate funded status of the
    single-employer defined benefit plans was a net liability of
    $6.6 million as of March 29, 2008, primarily recorded
    within other non-current liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet. These single-employer defined
    benefit plans had aggregate projected benefit obligations of
    $21.3 million and an aggregate fair value of plan assets of
    $18.8 million as of March 29, 2008. Pension expense
    for these plans, recorded within SG&A expenses in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of operations, was
    $3.6 million in Fiscal 2008, $2.2 million in Fiscal
    2007 and $1.8 million in Fiscal 2006.

It is the Company’s intention to withdraw from the
    multi-employer defined benefit plans assumed in the Japanese
    Business Acquisitions during Fiscal 2009. Accordingly, the
    Company has recorded a withdrawal liability within other
    non-current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet of
    $4.4 million as of March 29, 2008. Total contributions
    to these multi-employer plans were $0.5 million in Fiscal
    2008. The Company did not participate in any multi-employer
    defined benefit plans in Fiscal 2007 or Fiscal 2006.

20.

Segment
    Information

The Company has three reportable segments based on its business
    activities and organization: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.
    Such segments offer a variety of products through different
    channels of distribution. The Wholesale segment consists of
    women’s, men’s and children’s apparel,
    accessories and related products which are sold to major
    department stores, specialty stores, golf and pro shops and the
    Company’s owned and licensed retail stores in the
    U.S. and overseas. The Retail segment consists of the
    Company’s worldwide retail operations, which sell products
    through its full-price and factory stores, as well as
    RalphLauren.com, its

e-commerce

website. The stores and website sell products purchased from the
    Company’s licensees, suppliers and Wholesale segment. The
    Licensing segment generates revenues from royalties earned on
    the sale of the Company’s apparel, home and other products
    internationally and domestically through licensing alliances.
    The licensing agreements grant the licensees rights to use the
    Company’s various trademarks in connection with the
    manufacture and sale of designated products in specified
    geographical areas for specified periods.

The accounting policies of the Company’s segments are
    consistent with those described in Note 3. Sales and
    transfers between segments generally are recorded at cost and
    treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are
    eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating
    segment performance. Each segment’s performance is
    evaluated based upon operating income before restructuring
    charges and certain one-time items, such as legal charges, if
    any. Corporate overhead expenses (exclusive of certain expenses
    for senior management, overall branding-related expenses and
    certain other corporate-related expenses) are allocated to the
    segments based upon specific usage or other allocation methods.

Net revenues and operating income for each segment are as

Related
    Party Transactions

In the ordinary course of conducting its business, the Company
    periodically enters into transactions with other entities or
    people that are considered related parties.

Prior to the Japanese Business Acquisitions that occurred in May
    2007, the Company received royalty payments pursuant to a
    licensing agreement with Impact 21 that allowed Impact 21 to
    sell high quality apparel and related merchandise in Japan using
    certain of the Company’s trademarks. The Company had an
    approximately 20% interest in Impact 21, which was accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting. Royalty payments received
    under this arrangement were approximately $34 million in
    Fiscal 2007 and approximately $34 million in Fiscal 2006.
    See Note 5 for further discussion of the Company’s
    Japanese Business Acquisitions.

In addition, Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer, sometimes uses the services of
    certain employees of the Company for non-Company related
    purposes. Mr. Lauren reimburses the Company for the direct
    expenses incurred in connection with those services, including
    an allocation of such

employees’ salaries and benefits. Such aggregate costs and

    Transactions

Significant non-cash investing activities included the

    obligations in the net amount of $39.8 million for Fiscal
    2008 and $45.2 million for Fiscal 2007. Significant
    non-cash investing activities also included the non-cash
    allocation of the fair value of the net assets acquired in
    connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions and the Small
    Leathergoods Business Acquisition in Fiscal 2008, the RL Media
    Minority Interest Acquisition in Fiscal 2007 and the
    acquisitions of the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses in Fiscal
    2006. See Note 5 for further discussion of the
    Company’s acquisitions.

Significant non-cash financing activities included the
    repurchase of 0.4 million shares of Class A common
    stock at a cost of $24.0 million that was traded prior to
    the end of Fiscal 2008 for which settlement occurred in April
    2008. In addition, as a result of the adoption of FIN 48,
    the Company recognized a non-cash reduction in retained earnings
    of $62.5 million as the cumulative effect to adjust its net
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of April 1,
    2007. See Note 12 for further discussion of the
    Company’s adoption of FIN 48.

There were no other significant non-cash investing or financing
    activities for the three fiscal years presented.

Licensing-related
    Transactions

Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement

In February 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into
    a ten-year exclusive licensing agreement with Luxottica Group,
    S.p.A. and affiliates (“Luxottica”) for the design,
    production, sale and distribution of prescription frames and
    sunglasses under the

Polo Ralph Lauren

brand (the
    “Eyewear Licensing Agreement”).

The Eyewear Licensing Agreement took effect on January 1,
    2007 after the Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement
    with another licensee expired. In early January, the Company
    received a prepayment of approximately $180 million, net of
    certain tax withholdings, in consideration of the annual minimum
    royalty and design-services fees to be earned over the life of
    the contract. The prepayment is non-refundable, except with
    respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the Company, in
    which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment as
    determined based on the specific terms of the agreement would be
    required to be repaid. The prepayment was recorded by the
    Company as deferred income and is being recognized in earnings
    as earned in accordance with the terms of the agreement based
    upon the higher of (a) contractually guaranteed minimum
    royalty levels or (b) estimates of sales and royalty data
    received from the licensee.

Underwear
    Licensing Agreement

The Company licensed the right to manufacture and sell
    Chaps-branded underwear under a long-term license agreement,
    which was scheduled to expire in December 2009. During Fiscal
    2007, the Company and the licensee agreed to terminate the
    licensing and related design-services agreements. In connection
    with this agreement, the Company received a portion of the
    minimum royalty and design-service fees due to it under the
    underlying agreements on an accelerated basis. The approximate
    $8 million of proceeds received by the Company has been
    recognized as licensing revenue in the consolidated financial
    statements for Fiscal 2007.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of March 29, 2008 and
    March 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
    of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 29,
    2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company as of March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, and
    the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
    three fiscal years in the period ended March 29, 2008, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

As discussed in Note 3 to the notes to consolidated
    financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” effective April 1, 2007.
    Also, as discussed in Note 4 to the notes to consolidated
    financial statements, the Company elected application of Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,”
    effective April 2, 2006. As discussed in Note 3 to the
    notes to consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment,” effective April 2, 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    March 29, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated May 28, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of March 29, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in
    Management’s Report of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal
    control over financial reporting at Impact 21, which was
    acquired on May 29, 2007, and whose financial statements
    constitute 14.2% of total consolidated assets, 5.2% of total
    consolidated revenues, and 4.6% of total consolidated operating
    income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
    for the year ended March 29, 2008. Accordingly, our audit
    did not include the internal control over financial reporting at
    Impact 21. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of March 29, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    March 29, 2008, of the Company and our report dated
    May 28, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph
    relating to the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” effective April 1, 2007.
