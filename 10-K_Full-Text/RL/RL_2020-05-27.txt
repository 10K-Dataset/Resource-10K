PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies.

We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.

We organize our business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments. See "

Our Segments

" for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.

Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our


retail stores and


concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at over

11,000

doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate


Ralph Lauren stores,


Ralph Lauren concession shops, and


Club Monaco stores and shops.


We continue to invest in our business to stimulate growth. Over the past five fiscal years, we have invested approximately

$1.331 billion

for capital improvements, primarily funded through strong operating cash flow. We also have continued to return value to our shareholders through our common stock share repurchases and payment of quarterly cash dividends. Over the past five fiscal years, the cost of shares of Class A common stock repurchased pursuant to our common stock repurchase program was approximately

$1.800 billion

and dividends paid amounted to approximately

$892 million

.

We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As of

March 28, 2020

, Mr. R. Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately

84%

of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.

Objectives and Opportunities

We believe that our size and the global scope of our operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our different businesses. Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle brands, a well-diversified global multi-channel distribution network, an investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet, and an experienced management team. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in Item 7 — "

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends,

" we believe our core strengths will allow us to execute our long-term growth strategy.

An overview of our long-term growth strategy is presented below:


Global Citizenship and Sustainability

Global citizenship and sustainability at Ralph Lauren Corporation is rooted in the heritage of our brand and our purpose to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We believe that delivering the next 50 years for Ralph Lauren means rethinking our impact on the environment and society and utilizing creativity, the power of design, and innovative technologies to drive meaningful change.

Although we are at the beginning of this journey, the values and purpose that have defined our business for half a century underline the authenticity of our commitment for our next 50 years. We call our plan "Design the Change," which is guided by the following three pillars:

1.

Create Timeless Style

•

Sustainable Product Design

— We commit to designing more sustainable products and experiences by sourcing responsibly, manufacturing efficiently, and investing in innovation that advances these efforts.

•

Sourcing & Traceability

— We are committed to sourcing responsibly, securing a long-term, sustainable supply for key raw materials, as well as implementing a supplier engagement strategy that drives transparency, efficiency and partnerships that advance our work to deliver positive social and environmental impacts across our value chain.

•

Chemical Management

— We commit to monitor and reduce hazardous chemical use and discharge, ultimately eliminating all hazardous chemicals from the production of our products.

2.

Protect the Environment

•

Carbon and Energy

— We commit to address the issue of global climate change and the contributing impacts of our business by reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain.

•

Waste Management

— We commit to integrating zero waste principles across our business with an aim to divert waste from landfill through increasing recycling and upcycling, reducing waste at its source, and implementing other best practices.

•

Water Stewardship

— We commit to reducing water consumption across our value chain, and to safeguarding and preserving water resources in the communities where we operate.

3.

Champion Better Lives

•

Diversity and Inclusion

— We are committed to advancing an inclusive environment where everyone has a sense of belonging throughout our value chain.

•

Health, Safety & Working Conditions

— We aim to enrich the quality of work and life for all workers in our value chain by ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential in a safe and comfortable work environment.

•

Community Engagement & Philanthropy

— We commit to meaningfully engaging our communities through our work across cancer care as well as our global employee volunteerism program.

Additional information relating to Design the Change can be found in our annual sustainability report, which is available at our website at http://investor.ralphlauren.com under the caption "Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report." The content of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.


Recent Developments

COVID-19 Pandemic

A novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe in recent months, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty, companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work furloughs and reduced pay, which could lower consumers’ disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Further, even after such government restrictions and company initiatives are lifted, consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as their willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.

In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. For example, a significant number of our stores in parts of Asia were closed for a substantial portion of our fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020. Although our stores in Asia were largely reopened by the end of our Fiscal 2020, certain countries, including Japan, began imposing new restrictions during our first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Retail traffic also continues to be challenging in those regions in which our stores are open. Additionally, our stores in North America and the majority in Europe closed mid-March or earlier, and although certain stores have since reopened, a large number remain closed and we are uncertain when they will reopen. Our wholesale business has also been adversely affected, particularly in North America and Europe, as a result of department store closures and lower traffic and consumer demand.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity, including:

•

drawing down $475 million from our Global Credit Facility to bolster cash balances;

•

entering into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional

$500 million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements;

•

temporarily suspending our common stock repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividend;

•

temporarily reducing the base compensation of our executives and senior management team, as well as our Board of Directors;

•

carefully managing our expense structure across all key areas of spend, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand and postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities; and

•

temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees who nevertheless remain eligible for employee benefits during such period.

The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent this crisis will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, taking into account the guidance of local governments and global health organizations to determine when our operations can begin returning to normal course of business. See Item 1A — "

Risk Factors

—

Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business

"

for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Swiss Tax Reform

In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"), which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to


increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period. In connection with this transitional provision, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of

$122.9 million

during Fiscal 2020, which decreased our effective tax rate by

3,760 basis points

.

See

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act.

Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan

On June 4, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with our strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive sustainable growth (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan includes the following restructuring-related activities: (i) rightsizing and consolidation of our global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of our stores and shop-within-shops. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in gross annualized expense savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million.

In connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, we have recorded cumulative charges of

$145.8 million

since its inception, of which

$48.5 million

and

$97.3 million

were recorded during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.

See

Note 9

to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan.

Our Segments

We organize our business into the following three reportable segments:

•

North America

— Our North America segment, representing approximately

51%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club Monaco. In North America, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores.

•

Europe

— Our Europe segment, representing approximately

26%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, excluding Club Monaco. In Europe, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.

•

Asia

— Our Asia segment, representing approximately

17%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018. In addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.

No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately

6%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances, excluding Club Monaco.

This segment structure is consistent with how we establish our overall business strategy, allocate resources, and assess performance of our Company.

Effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, operating results related to our business in Latin America are included within our Europe segment due to a change in how we manage this business. Previously, such results were included within our other non-reportable segments. All prior period segment information has been recast to reflect this change on a comparative basis.

Approximately

46%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See

Note 20

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues and operating income by segment, as well as net revenues and long-lived assets by geographic location.

Our Retail Business

Our retail business sells directly to customers throughout the world via our


retail stores and


concession-based shop-within-shops, totaling approximately

4.1 million

and

0.7 million

square feet, respectively, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. We operate our business using a global omni-channel retailing strategy that seeks to deliver an integrated shopping experience with a consistent message of our brands and products to our customers, regardless of whether they are shopping for our products in physical stores or online.

Ralph Lauren Stores

Our Ralph Lauren stores feature a broad range of apparel, footwear, accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments in an atmosphere reflecting the distinctive attitude and image of the Ralph Lauren, Polo, and Double RL brands, including exclusive merchandise that is not sold in department stores. During

Fiscal 2020

, we opened


new Ralph Lauren


stores and closed

six

stores. Our Ralph Lauren stores are primarily situated in major upscale street locations and upscale regional malls, generally in large urban markets.

The following table presents the number of Ralph Lauren stores by segment as of

March 28, 2020

:

Our

nine

flagship Ralph Lauren regional store locations showcase our iconic styles and products and demonstrate our most refined merchandising techniques.

Our Ralph Lauren stores range in size from approximately

600 to 37,900

square feet.

Factory Stores

We extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our


factory stores worldwide, which are principally located in major outlet centers. Our worldwide factory stores offer selections of our apparel, footwear, accessories, and fragrances. In addition to these product offerings, certain of our factory stores in North America and Europe offer home furnishings. During

Fiscal 2020

, we opened


new factory stores and closed


factory stores.

The following table presents the number of factory stores by segment as of

March 28, 2020

:

Our factory stores range in size from approximately

1,100 to 28,300

square feet. Factory stores obtain products from our suppliers, our product licensing partners, and our other retail stores and digital commerce operations, and also serve as a secondary distribution channel for our excess and out-of-season products.

Concession-based Shop-within-Shops

The terms of trade for shop-within-shops are largely conducted on a concession basis, whereby inventory continues to be owned by us (not the department store) until ultimate sale to the end consumer. The salespeople involved in the sales transactions are generally our employees and not those of the department store.

The following table presents the number of concession-based shop-within-shops by segment as of

March 28, 2020

:

(a)

Our concession-based shop-within-shops were located at approximately


retail locations.

Directly-Operated Digital Commerce Websites

In addition to our stores, our retail business sells products online in North America and Europe through our various directly-operated digital commerce sites, which include www.RalphLauren.com and www.ClubMonaco.com, among others, as well as through our Polo mobile app in North America and the United Kingdom. In Asia, we sell products online through our directly-operated digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018, as well as through various third-party digital partner commerce sites.

Our Ralph Lauren digital commerce sites offer our customers access to a broad array of Ralph Lauren, Polo, and Double RL apparel, footwear, accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments, and reinforce the luxury image of our brands. While investing in digital commerce operations remains a primary focus, it is an extension of our investment in the integrated omni-channel strategy used to operate our overall retail business, in which our digital commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores.

Our Club Monaco digital commerce sites offer our domestic and Canadian customers access to our global assortment of Club Monaco apparel, footwear, and accessories product lines, as well as select online exclusives.

Our Wholesale Business

Our wholesale business sells our products globally to leading upscale and certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores, and golf and pro shops, as well as to various third-party digital partners. We have continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store product assortment and presentation, as well as full-price sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of

Fiscal 2020

, our wholesale products were sold through over

11,000

doors worldwide, with the majority in specialty stores. Our products are also increasingly being sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers.

The primary product offerings sold through our wholesale channels of distribution include apparel, footwear, accessories, and home furnishings. Our luxury brands, including Ralph Lauren Collection and Ralph Lauren Purple Label, are distributed worldwide through a limited number of premier fashion retailers. In North America, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores. In Europe, our wholesale business is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops. We also distribute our wholesale products to certain licensed stores operated by our partners in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

We sell the majority of our excess and out-of-season products through secondary distribution channels worldwide, including our retail factory stores.


Worldwide Wholesale Distribution Channels

The following table presents by segment the number of wholesale doors in our primary channels of distribution as of

March 28, 2020

:

We have three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During

Fiscal 2020

, sales to our three largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately

18%

of our total net revenues. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our North America segment.

Our products are sold primarily by our own sales forces. Our wholesale business maintains its primary showrooms in New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical element of our distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our products.

The following table presents by segment the number of shop-within-shops in our primary channels of distribution as of

March 28, 2020

:

The size of our shop-within-shops ranges from approximately

85 to 9,200

square feet. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and components, decorative items, and flooring. We normally share in the cost of building out these shop-within-shops with our wholesale customers.

Replenishment Program.

Core products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, select accessories, and home products can be ordered by our wholesale customers at any time through our replenishment program. We generally ship these products within two to five days of order receipt.

Our Licensing Business

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute the majority of product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory. Our licensing business has been aggregated with other non-reportable segments.

Product Licensing

We grant our product licensees the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, our licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger allocations typically are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our license agreements generally have two to five-year terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.


We work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed to reach the intended consumer and are presented consistently across product categories to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for most of our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, and advertising.

The following table lists our largest licensing agreements as of

March 28, 2020

for the product categories presented. Except as noted in the table, these product licenses cover North America only.

International Licensing

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given geographic area and source products from us, our product licensing partners, and independent sources. International licensees' rights may include the right to own and operate retail stores. As of

March 28, 2020

, our international licensing partners operated


Ralph Lauren stores,


Ralph Lauren concession shops, and


Club Monaco stores and shops.

Digital Ecosystem

Investing in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy that spans across owned and partnered channels, both physical and digital. Our digital ecosystem is comprised of directly-operated platforms, wholesale partner websites, third-party digital pure players, and social commerce.

Our directly-operated digital commerce sites represent our digital flagships, displaying the most elevated expression of our brands. The strategy for our digital flagships is to deliver distinct and immersive brand experiences, continuously enhance consumer experience, and develop digital content that drives deeper consumer engagement and conversion. With the ongoing launch of our localized sites, including in Ireland and Switzerland this year, we continue to expand the reach of our digital flagship experience. In connection with our long-term growth strategy, we are also working to broaden our omni-channel service offerings, such as buy online and pickup and return in store. In addition to our directly-operated digital commerce sites, we have also recently launched our Polo mobile app in the United Kingdom, our first mobile app launch outside of North America.

Our products are also sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers across the globe. With all partners in our ecosystem, we seek to showcase the brand consistently with our values. We collaborate with our key wholesale customers to deliver the right content to the right audience, and leverage consumer insights to develop a holistic, channel-agnostic view of our consumer.

We also sell our products online through various third-party digital pure-play sites to reach younger consumers and amplify our brand messages. On many of these sites, we have created digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories, and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. We also partner closely with our pure-play


customers on marketing content and events, as well as optimizing search and other data analyses to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands. We also continue to tap into the social commerce opportunity, such as our launch of Instagram shopping in Europe this year.

In connection with our digital commerce operations, we engage consumers through various digital and social media platforms, which are supported through our collaboration with influencers who have an authentic connection to our brand.

Seasonality of Business

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.

Product Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong international appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.

Our Ralph Lauren products are designed by, and under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff. We form design teams around our brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales, and production staff, these teams support all of our businesses in order to gain market information and other valuable input.

Marketing and Advertising

Our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to the success of our product offerings. The majority of our advertising program is created and executed by our in-house creative and advertising agency to ensure consistency of presentation, which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies.

We create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren aesthetic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by us and, in some cases, our licensing partners. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. With regard to influencers, we believe in fostering long-term relationships with those who have an authentic connection to our brand and influence the areas of culture that matter most to our audiences. We also continue to advertise through print and outdoor media, and, to a lesser extent, through television and cinema.

Our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, including the RL Magazine, RL Style Guide, and a wide array of video and social media content. We deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through online, mobile, video, email, and social media. Our digital commerce sites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle online, while offering a broad array of our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home product lines.


Additionally, we advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our retail and licensing partners. We have outdoor advertising placements in key cities as well, focusing on impact and reach. We also provide point-of-sale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners are required to spend an amount equal to a percentage of their licensed product sales on advertising, in certain cases we coordinate the advertising placement on their behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our global flagship locations, contribute to and enhance the themes of our brands to consumers.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. For example, we typically introduce each of the spring and fall menswear and womenswear collections at press presentations in major cities such as New York City and Milan. Such fashion events, in addition to celebrity red carpet dressing moments and events hosted in our stores and restaurants, including The

Polo Bar

in New York City, generate extensive domestic and international media and social coverage.

We continue to be the official outfitter for all on-court officials at both the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open tennis tournaments. Both tournaments provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams, with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits and associated leisure wear. Most recently, we dressed Team U.S.A. for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, and will be dressing the team for the next Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. As part of our involvement with Team U.S.A., we have established a partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns. We are also the official apparel outfitter for the Professional Golfers' Association ("PGA") of America, the PGA Championship, and the U.S. Ryder Cup Team, as well as a partner of the American Junior Golf Association. We sponsor a roster of professional golfers, including Billy Horschel, Davis Love III, Doc Redman, Justin Thomas, Nick Watney, and Tom Watson.

We believe our partnerships with such prestigious global athletic events reinforce our brand's sporting heritage in a truly authentic way and serve to connect our Company and brands to our consumers through their individual areas of passion.

Sourcing, Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Over


different manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home products, with no one manufacturer providing more than

4%

of our total production during

Fiscal 2020

. We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, and other trim. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. In

Fiscal 2020

, approximately

98%

of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately

25%

of our products sourced from China. See "

Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations,

" Item 1A — "

Risk Factors — Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business,"

and Item 1A — "

Risk Factors — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications

."

Most of our businesses must commit to the manufacturing of our garments before we sell finished goods, whether to wholly-owned retail stores or to wholesale customers. We also must commit to the purchase of fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers' demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn, we primarily sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn in our factory stores or through other secondary distribution channels.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. All products are produced according to our specifications and standards. Production and quality control staff in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed early in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.


Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel, footwear, accessories, fragrances, and home furnishing products, both domestic and international. We also face increasing competition from companies selling our product categories through the Internet. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, value, and service, which depend on our ability to:

•

anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online shopping;

•

create and maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and reputation for quality;

•

develop and produce innovative, high-quality products that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;

•

competitively price our products and create an acceptable value proposition for consumers;

•

provide strong and effective marketing support;

•

obtain additional points of distribution and sufficient retail floor space, and effectively present our products to consumers;

•

attract consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and websites;

•

source raw materials at cost-effective prices;

•

anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;

•

ensure product availability and optimize supply chain and distribution efficiencies;

•

maintain and grow market share;

•

recruit and retain key employees; and

•

protect our intellectual property.

See Item 1A — "

Risk Factors — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate

."

Distribution

To facilitate global distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution centers around the world for inspection, sorting, packing, and delivery to our retail locations and digital commerce and wholesale customers. This network includes the following primary distribution facilities:

(a)

Includes Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.


All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.

Information Systems

Our information systems facilitate business processes, consumer experiences, and decision-making support across the Company and our extended ecosystem of manufacturers, vendors, business partners, and customers. Our system applications are connected to support the flow of information across functions, including:

•

product design, sourcing, and production;

•

comprehensive order processing, fulfillment, and distribution;

•

retail store and digital commerce operations;

•

marketing and advertising;

•

financial accounting and management reporting; and

•

human resources.

Our retail operation systems, including point-of-sale registers and merchandising, planning, and inventory management systems, support operational processes within our store network and link with our digital commerce processes to support omni-channel capabilities.

We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. During Fiscal 2020, we migrated our Asia operations to a new financial reporting information technology system, Microsoft AX Dynamics 365. In addition to this system implementation, during Fiscal 2020, we began reconfiguring the financial reporting information technology system used by our Europe operations, SAP, in order to utilize enhanced financial reporting functionality. We are also continually enhancing the consumer experience by adding new functionality on our digital commerce sites.

We have a longstanding information security risk program committed to regular risk management practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes various technical controls, including security monitoring, data leakage protection, network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential or sensitive data. We have also implemented employee awareness training programs around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. We continually evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, employees and partners, and have instituted additional measures to help protect us from system intrusion or data breaches. Additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection, should a data breach occur.

See Item 1A — "

Risk Factors

—

A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business

" and "

Risk Factors

—

Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively

."

Wholesale Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners, and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite our accounts receivables, nor do we maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional activities are provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — "

Risk Factors

—

A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers

."


Wholesale Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers, with the exception of orders received through our replenishment program, which ship within two to five days of order receipt. Our wholesale orders are generally subject to broad cancellation rights.

The following table presents our wholesale backlog by segment as of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

:

Approximately 45% of our wholesale backlog was subsequently canceled during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 driven by adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, which include temporary department and specialty store closures worldwide, as well as declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. Accordingly, we cannot predict at this time how much of our remaining wholesale backlog will be fulfilled within the next 12 months.

The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the replenishment program's usage. As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period-to-period may not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.

Trademarks

We own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO BY RALPH LAUREN DESIGN, and the famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the U.S. and approximately 120 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we own include:

•

PURPLE LABEL;

•

DOUBLE RL;

•

RRL;

•

RLX;

•

LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;

•

PINK PONY;

•

LAUREN;

•

RALPH;

•

CHAPS;

•

CLUB MONACO; and

•

Various other trademarks, including those pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.

Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.


Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark infringement in certain parts of Asia.

In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A — "

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.

" for further discussion). Although we have not suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.

Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand is subject to duties. In addition, most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as "anti-dumping" actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the U.S. government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a U.S. industry.

In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import-related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations or executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A — "

and

"

Risk Factors

—

Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.

"

We are also subject to other international trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and other special trade preference programs. A portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs.

Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. Our products are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing, particularly with respect to products used by children. Any failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties and require us to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as


applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not anticipate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the next fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.

We are also subject to disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to identify the origin and existence of certain "conflict minerals" under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of specific actions to eradicate abusive labor practices in our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. While we require our suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and our operating guidelines which promote ethical and socially responsible business practices, any violation of labor, environmental, health, and safety or other laws, or any divergence by an independent supplier's labor practices from generally accepted industry standards, could damage our reputation, disrupt our sourcing capabilities, and increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations. See Item 1A — "

Risk Factors

—

Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.

Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.

Employees

As of

March 28, 2020

, we had approximately 24,900 employees, comprised of approximately 13,700 full-time and approximately 11,200 part-time employees. Approximately 13,800 of our employees are located in the U.S. and approximately 11,100 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 15 of our U.S. production employees in the womenswear business are members of Workers United (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an industry association collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.

Information About Our Executive Officers

The following are our current executive officers and their principal recent business experience:



Item 1A.

Risk Factors

There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risk factors could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our results of operations, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and/or the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods or if circumstances change.

The loss of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren, members of our executive management team, or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren's leadership in the design and marketing areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our Company. Mr. R. Lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears his name. Our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with Mr. R. Lauren's name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. The death or disability of Mr. R. Lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We also depend on the service and management experience of other key executive officers and other members of senior management who have substantial experience and expertise in our industry and our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. Competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our reputation, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and economic conditions, among other factors. The loss of the services of any of our key executive officers or other members of senior management, or one or more of our other key personnel, or the concurrent loss of several of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance covering our executive officers, including Mr. R. Lauren, or other members of senior management. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, but competition for experienced executives in our industry is intense and the non-compete period with respect to certain of our executive officers could, in some circumstances in the event of their termination of employment with our Company, end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements.

Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business could be adversely affected by infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19. COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe in recent months, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.

In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors, as described in Item 1 — "

Business

Recent Developments.

" The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent this crisis will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. Potential impacts to our business include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

our ability to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy during these uncertain times;

•

temporary closures of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities for unknown periods of time, as well as those of our wholesale customers and licensing partners;

•

potential declines in the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, caused by lower disposal income levels, travel restrictions, or other factors beyond our control;


•

the potential build-up of excess inventory as a result of store closures and/or lower consumer demand, including those resulting from potential changes in consumer behavior and/or shopping preferences, such as their willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations;

•

supply chain disruptions resulting from closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

•

our ability to access capital markets and maintain compliance with covenants associated with our existing debt instruments, as well as the ability of our key customers, suppliers, and vendors to do the same in regard to their own obligations;

•

the potential loss of one or more of our significant wholesale customers, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale customers, if they are not able to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables;

•

our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and

•

diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale.

Additional discussion related to the various risks and uncertainties described above is included elsewhere within this "Risk Factors" section of our Form 10-K.

Economic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic and other factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel, footwear, accessory, and home product industries, including, among others:

•

man-made or natural disasters, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19;

•

consumer perceptions of personal well-being and safety;

•

consumer perceptions of current and future economic conditions;

•

employment levels and wage rates;

•

stock market performance;

•

inflation;

•

interest rates;

•

foreign currency exchange rates;

•

the housing market;

•

consumer debt levels;

•

the availability of consumer credit;

•

commodity prices, including fuel and energy costs;

•

taxation;

•

general domestic and international political conditions;

•

the threat, outbreak, or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities; and

•

weather conditions.

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower. Unfavorable economic conditions and other factors, such as disease pandemics and other health-related concerns, political unrest, war, and acts of terrorism, may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores and shop-within-shops are located.


Further, consumers may prefer to spend more of their discretionary income on "experiences," such as dining and entertainment, over consumer goods. A downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we, or our wholesale customers and licensing partners, sell our products may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Item 7 — "

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

—

Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends

" for further discussion.

Our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

We have implemented key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain. Although we have shortened lead times for the design, sourcing, and production of certain of our product lines, we expect to continue to place orders with our vendors for the majority of products in advance of the related selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand and pricing shifts. Our failure to continue to shorten lead times or to correctly anticipate consumer preferences and demand could result in the build-up of excess inventory. Other factors beyond our control could also result in the build-up of excess inventory, including unforeseen adverse economic conditions or business disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess inventory levels could result in the utilization of less-preferred distribution channels, markdowns, promotional sales, destruction, or donations to dispose of such excess or slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our overall profitability and/or impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty, and result in lost sales. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Additionally, our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional retail environment, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. Although we continue to limit our promotional activity in connection with our quality of sales initiatives, these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, changes in our customer, channel, and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability.

A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers.

Several of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. A substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. During

Fiscal 2020

, sales to our three largest wholesale customers, accounted for approximately

18%

of total net revenues for

Fiscal 2020

, and constituted approximately

32%

of our total gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of

March 28, 2020

. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our North America segment.

We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our product lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by economic conditions, financial difficulties, competitive conditions, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their "private label" initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our wholesale customers have experienced significant business disruptions, including reduced traffic and temporary store closures. There can be no assurance that our wholesale customers have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged periods of such adverse economic conditions. The loss of one or more significant wholesale customers, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.


Further, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our large wholesale customers, particularly those located in the U.S., have been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, including our products. The continuation of such promotional activity could negatively impact our brand image and/or lead to requests from those customers for increased markdown allowances at the end of the season, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In response and in connection with our growth plan, we strategically reduce shipments to certain of our customers when deemed appropriate.

The department store sector has also experienced numerous consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, and other ownership changes in recent years, which could potentially increase in frequency in the near-term given the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such actions could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry our products, and the stores that remain open may purchase fewer of our products and/or reduce the retail floor space designated to our brands. There can be no assurance that consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, or other ownership changes in the department store sector will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Item 1 — "

Wholesale Credit Control.

"

Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.

Although we believe that our existing cash and investments, cash provided by operations, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and commercial paper borrowing program will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of economic conditions on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and their ability to access global capital markets cannot be predicted. The inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. Deterioration in global financial or capital markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs, increase the cost of any future financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit facilities. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.

We have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for shareholders, as described in Item 1 — "

Business

—

Objectives and Opportunities.

" Our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy is subject to various risks and uncertainties, as described within this "Risk Factors" section of our Form 10-K.

Although we believe that our growth strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute the various elements of our growth strategy, changes in consumer preferences, competition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such a failure could also result in the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.

Achievement of our growth strategy may require investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies. These investments may result in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. There can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and other costs, if at all.


We may not be successful in the expansion of our multi-channel distribution network or accelerating growth in certain product categories.

Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our multi-channel distribution network, including within international markets such as China, which is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:

•

identify new or underpenetrated markets where our products and brand will be accepted by consumers;

•

attract customers, particularly in new markets;

•

identify desirable freestanding and department store locations, the availability of which may be out of our control;

•

negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances;

•

efficiently and cost effectively build-out stores and shop-within-shops;

•

source sufficient inventory levels to meet the needs of the new stores and shop-within-shops;

•

hire, train, and retain competent store personnel; and

•

integrate new stores and shop-within-shops into our existing systems and operations.

Any of these challenges could delay or otherwise prevent us from successfully executing our distribution expansion strategy. There can be no assurance that our new stores and shop-within-shops will be successful and profitable or if the capital costs associated with the build-out of such new locations will be recovered. Further, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new or existing competitors that have a more established market presence than us or other competitive advantages. Other risks related to our international expansion plans include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and any resulting anti-American sentiment, political instability, and foreign government regulation, among other risks described herein. If our expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to maintain, enhance, and expand our digital footprint and capabilities. Consumers are increasingly shopping online using computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce platforms, including mobile apps, could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our digital commerce business, sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where digital commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.

Our growth strategy also includes accelerating growth in certain high-value, underdeveloped product categories, comprised of denim, wear to work, outerwear, footwear, and accessories. We compete with other retailers in these product categories, some of which may be significantly larger than us and more established in these product categories, and competition is intense, as described within other risk factors herein. There can be no assurance that our targeted expansion in these product categories will be successful.

The success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner, develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, and provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers.

The industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, current economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. This issue is further compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared across the globe. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer preferences in the future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if


manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For a discussion of risks related to our inventory management, see "

Our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

"

Our marketing and advertising programs are integral to the success of our product offerings and on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. However, we cannot assure that our marketing and advertising programs will be successful or appeal to consumers.

The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable omni-channel experience for our customers. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to a shopping experience through multiple technologies, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as our customers have become increasingly technologically savvy. We are increasingly using digital and social media platforms to interact with customers and enhance their shopping experience. If we are unable to develop and continuously improve our customer-facing technologies, we may not be able to provide a convenient and consistent experience to our customers regardless of the sales channel. This could negatively affect our ability to compete with other retailers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We have also implemented, and expect to continue to implement, new store design concepts as part of our growth strategy. There can be no assurance that any of our store designs will resonate with customers or otherwise achieve the desired sales and profitability measures necessary to recover our initial capital investments. If customers are not receptive to the design layout or visual merchandising of our stores, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the failure of our store designs to achieve acceptable results could lead to our decision to close a store prior to the lease expiration date. For additional discussion of risks related to the early termination of our leases, see "

Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.

"

The success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value and reputation of our brands.

Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate, identify, and respond to customers' demands, preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products, including the preference for certain products to be manufactured in the U.S. As the Ralph Lauren name is integral to our business, any negative publicity regarding Mr. R. Lauren or our Company, especially through social media which accelerates and increases the potential scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact the image of our brands with our customers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, even if the subject of such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. There is also increased focus from consumers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. Although we have established certain long-term initiatives and goals regarding our impact on the environment and society as a whole, there can be no assurance that our various stakeholders will agree with our initiatives or if we will be successful in achieving our goals. Our failure to comply with ethical, social, product safety, labor, health, environmental or other standards and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions and/or investment decisions by investors, as well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Even if we react appropriately to negative publicity, our customers' perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Any failure on our part to retain the value and reputation of brands could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.

We face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, footwear, accessories, home, and other of our product categories through the Internet. Although we sell our products through the Internet, increased competition and promotional activity in the worldwide apparel, footwear, accessory, and home product industries from Internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also face intense competition from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel, footwear, accessory, and casual apparel producers that sell products through brick and mortar stores and wholesale and licensing channels. We compete with these companies primarily on the basis of:

•

anticipating and responding in a timely fashion to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online shopping;

•

creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality;


•

developing and producing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;

•

competitively pricing our products and creating an acceptable value proposition for consumers;

•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at stores and shop-within-shops;

•

attracting consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and websites;

•

sourcing raw materials at cost-effective prices;

•

anticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with third-party manufacturers and retailers;

•

maintaining and growing market share;

•

recruiting and retaining key employees;

•

protecting our intellectual property; and

•

the ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions.

Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources, more desirable store locations, and/or greater digital commerce presence than us, among other competitive advantages. Such competitive advantages may enable them to better withstand unfavorable economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, and/or more quickly respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences than us. In addition, technological advances and the retail industry's low barriers to entry allow for the introduction of new competitors and products at a rapid pace.

Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional capital-related transactions in the future.

As of March 28, 2020, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.171 billion, comprised of our outstanding borrowings under our Global Credit Facility and Senior Notes. Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the original agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility from $500 million to

$1 billion

through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. Further, in May 2020, we entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional

$500 million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

We rely on our operating cash flows to repay our outstanding borrowings, as well as to fund any working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. Prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as our recent store closures in North America, Europe, and Asia due to COVID-19, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations.

In addition, certain of our debt instruments contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants. On May 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Global Credit Facility that relaxed certain financial covenants while providing additional restrictions under our negative covenants for a specified period of time as further described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our failure to comply with such covenants, or otherwise secure temporary waivers of non-compliance, could result in our lenders demanding all amounts outstanding to be immediately repaid. Credit rating agencies also periodically review our capital structure and our ability to generate earnings. A prolonged period of deteriorated financial performance or our inability to comply with debt covenants could make future financing more difficult to secure and/or expensive.


Moreover, our Global Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, including that there has been no material adverse change in the business, operations, property or condition (financial  or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a wholes, since March 2019. It is a condition to making each borrowing and to the issuance, increase, renewal or extension of each letter of credit that our representations be true at the time of the event in question. The recent amendment to the Global Credit Facility provides that through March 31, 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as disclosed to the lenders in May 2020 or reasonably foreseeable based on the disclosure to the lenders will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a material adverse change has occurred.

Further, factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, could disrupt capital markets and limit the availability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital to us in the future. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing markets is subject to certain risks associated with operating in various locations around the globe. These include, but are not limited to:

•

complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, trade, labor, product labeling, and product safety restrictions, as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and similar foreign country laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibits U.K. and related companies from any form of bribery;

•

adapting to local customs and culture;

•

unexpected changes in laws, judicial processes, or regulatory requirements;

•

the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges or other barriers to trade;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;

•

political instability, such as the recent protests in Hong Kong, and terrorist attacks;

•

pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices. For example, although trade relations between the U.S. and China have begun to ease, both countries have imposed new tariffs on each other related to the importation of certain product categories, including imports of apparel into the U.S. from China. As a result of actions to mitigate our exposure to the resulting tariffs, which include diverting production to and sourcing from other countries, driving productivity within our existing supplier base, and taking pricing actions, the tariffs enacted to date are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business operations. However, if the U.S. decides to impose additional tariffs on apparel or other of our goods imported from China, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset all related increased costs, which could be material to our business operations as approximately 25% of our products are sourced from China. There have also been recent changes to U.S. participation in, and discussion regarding the potential renegotiation of, certain international trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. We cannot predict if, and to what extent, there will be changes to international trade agreements or the resulting impact such changes would have on our business operations. For a discussion of risks associated with the importation of products, see "

Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.

"

Our business could also be impacted by changes to the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD"), which represents a coalition of member countries, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. In response, certain member countries are beginning to implement legislation to align their international tax rules with the OECD's recommendations, such as Switzerland’s recently enacted Swiss Tax Act, as described in Item 1 — "

Business

—

Recent Developments.

" Taxing authorities of certain state, local, and other foreign jurisdictions may also decide to modify existing tax


laws. We cannot predict which, if any, of these items or others will be enacted into law or the resulting impact any such enactment will have on our business operations. However, if new legislation were enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Additionally, the United Kingdom recently withdrew from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit." Although it ceased to be a member of the European Union effective January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is now in a “transition period” during which its existing trading relationship with the European Union will remain in place and it will continue to follow the European Union’s rules. Negotiations during the transition period to determine the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union post-transition period, including terms of trade, are expected to be complex. It is not clear at this time what, if any, agreements will be reached by the current December 31, 2020 transition period deadline. Brexit could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union could also adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products. Although we are closely monitoring the latest developments regarding Brexit and are assessing risk and opportunities and developing strategies to mitigate our exposure once the transition period expires, any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Brexit has also contributed to significant volatility and uncertainty in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and such volatility could continue to occur as the negotiation process progresses. For a discussion of risks related to currency exchange fluctuations, see "

Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.

"

Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. Our products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over


foreign manufacturers in various countries. In

Fiscal 2020

, approximately

98%

of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately

25%

of our products sourced from China. Risks inherent in importing our products include:

•

pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

•

changes in social, political, and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;

•

the imposition of additional regulations, quotas, or safeguards relating to imports or exports, and costs of complying with such regulations and other laws relating to the identification and reporting of the sources of minerals used in our products;

•

the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports;

•

unfavorable changes in the availability, cost, or quality of raw materials and commodities;

•

increases in the cost of labor, travel, and transportation;

•

disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters, labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes, strikes, or otherwise), or other unforeseen events;

•

heightened terrorism-related cargo and supply chain security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent, or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in the delivery of cargo;

•

decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures, and damage to the reputation of our brands; and

•

the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by national governments.

Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For a discussion of risks related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "

Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.

"


In addition, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Prices of raw materials used to manufacture our products may also fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors, including general economic conditions, energy prices, crop yields, and availability of labor and the related costs of such labor. Any increases in prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales. Furthermore, the cost of labor at many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries such as China continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. The cost of transportation remains significant as well, and it is likely that such cost will fluctuate significantly if oil prices remain volatile. We may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, freight, or labor costs through pricing actions or other means.

A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business.

We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including our digital commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our digital commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. In our normal course of business, we often collect, transmit, and/or retain certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information. There is significant concern by consumers, employees, and lawmakers alike over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy, as cyber-criminals are becoming increasingly more sophisticated in their attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and confidential or sensitive data.

Despite the security measures we currently have in place (including those described in Item 1 — "

Business

—

Information Systems

"), our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, phishing attacks, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other Internet or email events. The increased use of smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices, as well as the need for a substantial portion of our corporate employees to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, may also heighten these and other operational risks. The retail industry in particular continues to be the target of many cyber-attacks, which are becoming increasingly more difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature. Although we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance to provide a level of financial protection should a data breach occur, such insurance may not cover us against all claims or costs associated with such a breach. Additionally, the technology we use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated as a result of advances in computer capabilities or other technological developments. Further, measures we implement to protect our computer systems against cyber-attacks may make them harder to use or reduce the speed at which they operate, which in turn could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales.

Any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties, and liability, and result in deterioration in our customers' and employees' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our employees, customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, result in lost sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and/or reduce our ability to attract and retain employees and customers. As these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and our infrastructure, including the implementation of new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, deployment of additional personnel and protection-related technologies, engagement of third-party consultants, and training of employees.

In addition, the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly more demanding with frequent new requirements surrounding the handling, protection, and use of personal and sensitive information. We may incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information. Additionally, failing to comply with such laws and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions, as well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.


Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.

We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, accounting for and reporting financial results, and managing our employees and employee benefit programs. In addition, we have digital commerce and other informational websites in North America, Europe, and Asia, including Australia and New Zealand, and have plans for additional digital commerce sites in the future. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on a daily basis, it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems.

Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, technical malfunctions, inadequate system capacity, power outages, natural disasters, and usage errors by our employees or third-party consultants. If our information technology systems become damaged or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or replace them. Additionally, confidential or sensitive data related to our customers or employees could be lost or compromised. We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software, which also involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation, or transition of such systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in the sourcing, sale, and shipment of our product, delays in the collection of cash from our customers, and/or adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner. Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors may place larger orders than we do, and thus may have an advantage in securing production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us. See Item 1 — "

Business

-

Sourcing, Production and Quality.

" We enter into purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.

In addition, we rely on a number of owned, leased, and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and perform other related logistic services. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of these distribution centers. Our distributions centers generally utilize computer-controlled and automated equipment, which are subject to various risks, including software viruses, security breaches, power interruptions, or other system failures. If any of our distribution centers were to close or become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or if we fail to successfully consolidate existing facilities or transition to new facilities, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of deliveries to our customers and our stores, increased costs, and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be required to reopen or replace the facility. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services is subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, potential labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes, strikes, or otherwise), severe weather, and pandemic diseases, which could delay the timing of shipments, and increases in wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher transportation costs. Any delays in the timing of our product shipments or increases in transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.


Our business could be adversely affected by man-made or natural disasters and other catastrophic events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.

We have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to man-made or natural disasters, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, severe weather, geological events, and other catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks and military conflict, any of which could disrupt our operations. In addition, our customers and suppliers also have operations in these locations and could experience similar disruptions. The occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect financial markets and the availability of capital.  In addition, our business can be affected by unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the summer. Any of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.

We are subject to income and non-income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any given time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules. Additionally, our products are subject to import and excise duties, and/or sales, consumption, value-added taxes ("VAT"), and other non-income taxes in certain international jurisdictions. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the appropriate amount of income or non-income taxes could subject us to substantial fines and penalties and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change, such as the recently-enacted Swiss Tax Act, or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of risks related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "

Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.

"

Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.

Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. Specifically, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies impact our financial results from a transactional perspective, as our foreign operations generally purchase inventory in U.S. dollars, as is common for most apparel companies. Given that we source most of our products overseas, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as affect the U.S. Dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Additionally, the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as their financial results are translated from the respective local currency into U.S. Dollars during the financial statement consolidation process. The foreign currencies to which we are exposed to from a transactional and translational perspective primarily include the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi. The expansion of our international business increases our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.

Although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the availability of hedging instruments. As such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. See Item 7 — "

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Market Risk Management

."


Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.

We generally operate most of our stores and corporate facilities under long-term, non-cancellable leasing arrangements. Our retail store leases typically require us to make minimum rental payments, and often contingent rental payments based upon sales. In addition, our leases generally require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities. We generally cannot cancel our leases at our option. If we decide to close a store, or if we decide to downsize, consolidate, or relocate any of our corporate facilities, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store or corporate facility. In addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term, even after the space is exited or otherwise closed (such as our recent temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic). Such costs and obligations related to the early or temporary closure of our stores or termination of our leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, as each of our leases naturally expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could lead to store closures resulting in lost sales.

The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance, including our ability to return value to shareholders.

Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that, from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings. While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our guidance or other forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and full fiscal year expectations. Additionally, external analysts and investors may publish their own independent predictions of our future performance. We do not endorse such predictions or assume any responsibility to correct such predictions when they differ from our own expectations. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.

In addition, we periodically return value to shareholders through our payment of quarterly cash dividends and common stock share repurchases. Investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, further increase our cash dividend rate, and/or repurchase shares available under our Class A common stock repurchase program. Our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase our Class A common stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control, such as impacts related to COVID-19, which has resulted in us temporarily suspending our quarterly cash dividend and share repurchases during the crisis. Further, our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, elect to suspend or otherwise alter these programs at any time. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend payments and/or Class A common stock share repurchase activity differ from investors' expectations.

We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans.

We have implemented restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives, such as the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, as described in Item 1 — "

Business

—

Recent Developments.

" Although designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth, restructuring plans present significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including:

•

higher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the U.S.;

•

higher than anticipated lease termination and store closure costs (see "

Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases

");

•

failure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge;

•

failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to completing, our restructuring plans;


•

diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale;

•

attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce; and

•

damage to our reputation and brand image due to our restructuring-related activities, including the closure of certain of our stores.

If we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements, sales growth, and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our failure to achieve targeted results for any reason, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could also lead to the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.

Changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business.

Certain members of our executive and senior management team have departed in recent years, and we may implement other management and organizational changes in connection with our growth strategy. Any changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. The departure of certain key individuals and the failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could hinder or delay our strategic planning and execution, as well as adversely affect our ability to attract and retain other experienced and talented employees. Further, our recent decision to furlough a significant portion of our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt our business operations and processes, as well as our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any such disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.

We believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. However, significant counterfeiting and imitation of our products continue to exist. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries. Over the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights to some of our key trademarks that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting, lost business, or brand dilution, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to challenge brands arising from imitation of our products. Also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all.

Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.

We are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.

In addition, we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor, environmental, or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or licensing partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.


Certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely affect our business.

We are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers, licensees, or other third parties. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our Company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries where we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Item 3 — "

Legal Proceedings

" for further discussion of our Company's legal matters.

In addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other regulatory agencies. If and when effective, such changes to accounting standards could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recently issued accounting standards.

The voting shares of our Company's stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.

As of

March 28, 2020

, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately

84%

of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of our Company. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren serves as our Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Mr. R. Lauren's son, Mr. David Lauren, serves as our Chief Innovation Officer, Strategic Advisor to the CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, and we employ other members of the Lauren family. From time to time, we may have other business dealings with Mr. R. Lauren, members of the Lauren family, or entities affiliated with Mr. R. Lauren or the Lauren family. As a result of his stock ownership and position in our Company, Mr. R. Lauren has the ability to exercise significant control over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a class and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

We rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses. Failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing partner's business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner's ability to:

•

obtain capital;

•

execute its business plans;

•

manage its labor relations;

•

maintain relationships with its suppliers and customers; and

•

manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively.

Although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. While we have significant control over our licensing partners' products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.

Although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.

Properties.

We lease space for our retail stores, showrooms, warehouses, and offices in various domestic and international locations. We do not own any real property except for our retail digital commerce call center and distribution facility in High Point, North Carolina; and our retail stores in Southampton and Easthampton, New York, and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

We believe that our existing facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition, and are adequate for our present level of operations.

square feet. We anticipate that we will be able to extend our retail store leases, as well as those leases for our non-retail facilities, which expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to desirable alternate locations. We generally lease our freestanding retail stores for initial periods ranging from

5 to 15 years

Legal Proceedings.

We are involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to our business, including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation of products, taxation, unclaimed property, and employee relations. We believe at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, our assessment of any litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

As of

May 22, 2020

, there were 667 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 6 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "RL." All of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren, Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family. Shares of our Class B common stock may be converted immediately into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder. There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company. The shares of Class A common stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No shares of our Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock during the fiscal quarter ended

March 28, 2020

.

The following table sets forth repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock during the fiscal quarter ended

March 28, 2020

:

(a)

Includes 11,827 shares surrendered to or withheld by the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards issued under its long-term stock incentive plans.

(b)

As of

March 28, 2020

, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately

$580 million

, reflecting the

May 13, 2019

approval by our Board of Directors to expand the program by up to an additional

$600 million

of Class A common stock repurchases. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. Accordingly, as a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity.


The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) on our Class A common stock to the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and a peer group index of companies that we believe are closest to ours (the "Peer Group") for the period from March 28, 2015, the last day of our 2015 fiscal year, through

March 28, 2020

, the last day of our


fiscal year. Our Peer Group consists of Burberry Group PLC, Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, EssilorLuxottica SA, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Hermes International, Kering, LVMH, PVH Corp., Tapestry, Inc., Tiffany & Co., Tod's S.p.A., and V.F. Corporation. All calculations for foreign companies in our Peer Group are performed using the local foreign issue of such companies. The returns are calculated by assuming a $100 investment made on March 28, 2015 in Class A common stock or March 31, 2015 in an index, with all dividends reinvested.

OVERVIEW

Our Business

Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, Chaps, and Club Monaco, among others.

We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.


We organize our business into the following three reportable segments:

•

North America

— Our North America segment, representing approximately

51%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club Monaco. In North America, our retail business is comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores.

•

Europe

— Our Europe segment, representing approximately

26%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, excluding Club Monaco. In Europe, our retail business is comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.

•

Asia

— Our Asia segment, representing approximately

17%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018. In addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.

No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately

6%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances, excluding Club Monaco.

Effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, operating results related to our business in Latin America are included within our Europe segment due to a change in how we manage this business. Previously, such results were included within our other non-reportable segments. All prior period segment information has been recast to reflect this change on a comparative basis.

Approximately

46%

of our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See

Note 20

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments.

Recent Developments

COVID-19 Pandemic

A novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe in recent months, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty, companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work furloughs and reduced pay, which could lower consumers’ disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Further, even after such government restrictions and company initiatives are lifted, consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as their willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.

In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. For example, a significant number of our stores in parts of Asia were closed for a substantial portion of our fourth


quarter of Fiscal 2020. Although our stores in Asia were largely reopened by the end of our Fiscal 2020, certain countries, including Japan, began imposing new restrictions during our first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Retail traffic also continues to be challenging in those regions in which our stores are open. Additionally, our stores in North America and the majority in Europe closed mid-March or earlier, and although certain stores have since reopened, a large number remain closed and we are uncertain when they will reopen. Our wholesale business has also been adversely affected, particularly in North America and Europe, as a result of department store closures and lower traffic and consumer demand.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity, including:

•

drawing down $475 million from our Global Credit Facility to bolster cash balances;

•

entering into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional

$500 million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements;

•

temporarily suspending our common stock repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividend;

•

temporarily reducing the base compensation of our executives and senior management team, as well as our Board of Directors;

•

carefully managing our expense structure across all key areas of spend, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand and postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities; and

•

temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees who nevertheless remain eligible for employee benefits during such period.

The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent this crisis will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, taking into account the guidance of local governments and global health organizations to determine when our operations can begin returning to normal course of business. See Item 1A — "

for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Swiss Tax Reform

In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"), which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period. In connection with this transitional provision, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of

$122.9 million

during Fiscal 2020, which decreased our effective tax rate by

3,760 basis points

.

See

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act.

Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan

On June 4, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with our strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive sustainable growth (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan includes the following restructuring-related activities: (i) rightsizing and consolidation of our global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of our stores and shop-within-shops. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in gross annualized expense savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million.

In connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, we have recorded cumulative charges of

$145.8 million

since its inception, of which

$48.5 million

and

$97.3 million

were recorded during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Actions


associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.

See

Note 9

to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan.

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"), which became effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.

During Fiscal 2018, we recorded net charges of

$221.4 million

within our income tax provision in connection with the TCJA, which increased our effective tax rate by

4,520 basis points

. Subsequently, during Fiscal 2019, we recorded net measurement period adjustments of

$27.6 million

as permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"). These measurement period adjustments increased our effective tax rate by

470 basis points

during Fiscal 2019.

See

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the TCJA.

Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends

The global economy and retail industry are impacted by many different factors. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in heightened uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. As discussed in "

Recent Developments,"

governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such actions, together with changes in consumers' willingness to congregate in populated areas and lower levels of disposal income due to rising unemployment rates, have resulted in significant business disruptions across a wide array of industries and an overall decline of the global economy.

The global economy has also been impacted by the domestic and international political environment, including volatile international trade relations and political unrest. Although trade relations between the U.S. and China have begun to ease, both countries have imposed new tariffs on each other related to the importation of certain product categories. Concerns also exist regarding the United Kingdom's recent withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit." The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the European Union, effective January 31, 2020, and has entered a "transition period" during which its existing trading relationship with the European Union will remain in place and it will continue to follow the European Union's rules. Negotiations during the transition period to determine the United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union, including terms of trade, are expected to be complex. It is not clear at this time what, if any, agreements will be reached by the current December 31, 2020 transition period deadline and the resulting impact on consumer sentiment. Additionally, certain other worldwide events, including political protests such as those that recently took place in Hong Kong, acts of terrorism, taxation or monetary policy changes, fluctuations in commodity prices, and rising healthcare costs, also increase volatility in the global economy.

The retail landscape in which we operate has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including widespread temporary closures of stores and distribution centers and declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers had been increasingly shifting their shopping preference from physical stores to online. This shift in preference could potentially be amplified in the future as a byproduct of the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers may prefer to avoid populated locations, such as shopping centers, in fear of exposing themselves to infectious diseases. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many retailers, including certain of our large wholesale customers, have been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise on a periodic basis in an attempt to offset declines in physical store traffic. The retail industry, particularly in the U.S., has also experienced numerous bankruptcies, restructurings, and ownership changes in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate these trends if companies do not have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions. The continuation of these industry trends could further impact consumer spending and consumption behavior in our industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.

We have implemented various strategies globally to help address many of these current challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term profitable growth centered around strengthening our consumer-facing areas of product, stores, and


marketing across channels and driving a more efficient operating model. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity, as described in

"Recent Developments."

Investing in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which could reshape consumer shopping preferences. We also continue to take deliberate actions to ensure promotional consistency across channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience, including better aligning shipments and inventory levels with underlying demand. We also remain committed to optimizing our wholesale distribution channel and enhancing our department store consumer experience. Further, in response to the recent trade developments between the U.S. and China, we have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to the resulting tariffs, including diverting production to and sourcing from other countries, driving productivity within our existing supplier base, and taking pricing actions. As a result of these efforts, the tariffs enacted to date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are also closely monitoring the latest Brexit developments and are assessing risks and opportunities and developing strategies to mitigate our exposure once the transition period expires, including evaluating scenarios in which the transition period ends without trade agreements in place.

We will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and will evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and foreign currency and cost management opportunities to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting and elevating the value of our brand.

For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A — "

Summary of Financial Performance

Operating Results

In

Fiscal 2020

, we reported net revenues of

$6.160 billion

, net income of

$384.3 million

, and net income per diluted share of

$4.98

, as compared to net revenues of

$6.313 billion

, net income of

$430.9 million

, and net income per diluted share of

$5.27

in

Fiscal 2019

. The comparability of our operating results has been affected by adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, as well as restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges. Our operating results have also been affected by international and domestic tax reform.

Our operating performance for

Fiscal 2020

reflected revenue declines of

2.4%

on a reported basis and

1.2%

on a constant currency basis, as defined within "

Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition

"

below, reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions.

Our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues

decreased

by

230 basis points

to

59.3%

during

Fiscal 2020

, primarily driven by inventory charges recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by favorable geographic, channel, and product mix, improved pricing, and lower levels of promotional activity.

Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of net revenues

increased

by

240 basis points

to

52.6%

during

Fiscal 2020

, primarily driven by operating deleverage on lower net revenues and higher bad debt expense, both largely attributable to COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix.

Net income

decreased

by

$46.6 million

to

$384.3 million

in

Fiscal 2020

as compared to

Fiscal 2019

, primarily due to a

$244.8 million

decrease in operating income reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, partially offset by a

$209.5 million

decrease in our income tax provision largely driven by the combined impact of international and domestic tax reform. Net income per diluted share decreased by

$0.29

to

$4.98

per share in

Fiscal 2020

as compared to

Fiscal 2019

, due to lower net income, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during

Fiscal 2020

.

Net income during

Fiscal 2020

reflected a one-time income tax benefit of

$122.9 million

, or

$1.59

per diluted share, recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act and and net income during

Fiscal 2019

reflected TCJA enactment-related charges of

$27.6 million

, or

$0.34

per diluted share. Our operating results during

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets (including an equity method investment), and certain other charges (including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions) totaling

$321.8 million

and

$163.1 million

, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by

$244.8 million

, or

$3.17

per diluted share, and

$129.0 million

, or

$1.58

per diluted share, respectively.


Financial Condition and Liquidity

We ended

Fiscal 2020

in a net cash and investments position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt) of

$945.3 million

, compared to

$1.343 billion

as of the end of

Fiscal 2019

. The decrease in our net cash and investments position was primarily due to our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of

$694.8 million

, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through

$270.3 million

in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of

$203.9 million

, partially offset by our operating cash flows of

$754.6 million

.

We generated

$754.6 million

of cash from operations during

Fiscal 2020

, compared to

$783.8 million

during

Fiscal 2019

. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period.

Our equity decreased to

$2.693 billion

as of

March 28, 2020

, compared to

$3.287 billion

as of

March 30, 2019

, primarily due to our share repurchase activity, dividends declared, and cumulative adjustments from our adoption of new accounting standards, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during

Fiscal 2020

.

Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition

The comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain events, including:

•

pretax charges incurred in connection with our restructuring plans, as well as certain other asset impairments and other charges, including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions, as summarized below (references to "Notes" are to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements):

(a)

Non-routine inventory charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. Fiscal 2020 includes non-routine inventory charges of

$157.3 million

related to adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions. All other non-routine inventory charges related to our restructuring plans (see Note 9).

(b)

COVID-19-related bad debt expense is recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

(c)

Fiscal 2020 includes a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. All other impairment charges were recorded within impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations.

•

adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including, but not limited to, incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded during Fiscal 2020, as summarized in the table above;

•

a one-time benefit of

$122.9 million

recorded within our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2020 in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, which decreased our effective tax rate by

3,760 basis points

. See

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion; and

•

TCJA enactment-related charges of

$27.6 million

and

$221.4 million

recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, which increased our effective tax rate by

470 basis points

and

4,520 basis points

, respectively. See

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.


Since we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the "Results of Operations" section where applicable.

Our discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics are calculated on a constant currency basis.

Our "Results of Operations" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting comparability. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues

decreased

by

$153.2 million

, or

2.4%

, to

$6.160 billion

in

Fiscal 2020

as compared to

Fiscal 2019

, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of

$77.1 million

. On a constant currency basis, net revenues

decreased

by

$76.1 million

, or

1.2%

, reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions.

The following table summarizes the percentage change in our

Fiscal 2020

consolidated comparable store sales as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions:


Our global average store count increased by 43 stores and concession shops during

Fiscal 2020

compared with the prior fiscal year, largely driven by new openings in Asia and Europe. The following table details our retail store presence by segment as of the periods presented:

In addition to our stores, we sell products online in North America and Europe through our various digital commerce sites, which include www.RalphLauren.com and www.ClubMonaco.com, among others, as well as through our Polo mobile app in North America and the United Kingdom. In Asia, we sell products online through our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018, as well as through various third-party digital partner commerce sites.

Net revenues for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's net revenues from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:

North America net revenues

— Net revenues

decreased

by

$62.4 million

, or

2.0%

, during

Fiscal 2020

as compared to

Fiscal 2019

, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of

$1.4 million

. On a constant currency basis, net revenues

decreased

by

$61.0 million

, or

1.9%

, reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions.

The

$62.4 million

net

decline

in North America net revenues was driven by:

•

a $101.2 million net decrease related to our North America wholesale business, largely driven by weaker demand and challenging department store traffic trends, as well as COVID-19 business disruptions.

This decrease was partially offset by:

•

an increase of $38.8 million related to our North America retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $0.7 million and the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $39.5 million driven by an increase of $47.1 million in non-comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change


in comparable store sales related to our North America retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:

Europe net revenues

— Net revenues

decreased

by

$50.8 million

, or

3.0%

, during

Fiscal 2020

as compared to

Fiscal 2019

, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of

$63.6 million

. On a constant currency basis, net revenues

increased

by

$12.8 million

, or

0.8%

, despite adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions.

The

$50.8 million

net

decline

in Europe net revenues was driven by:

•

a $44.3 million net decrease related to our Europe wholesale business driven by net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $32.3 million and COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by stronger demand prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; and

•

a $6.5 million net decrease related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $31.3 million and the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $24.8 million driven by an increase of $32.4 million in non-comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:

Asia net revenues

— Net revenues

decreased

by

$23.8 million

, or

2.3%

, during

Fiscal 2020

as compared to

Fiscal 2019

, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of

$11.6 million

. On a constant currency basis, net revenues

decreased

by

$12.2 million

, or

1.2%

, reflecting estimated adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions.

The

$23.8 million

net

decline

in Asia net revenues was driven by:

•

a $21.9 million net decrease related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $10.7 million and the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $11.2 million, reflecting a decrease of $36.4 million in comparable store sales, partially offset by an increase of $25.2 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions:

•

a $1.9 million net decrease related to our Asia wholesale business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $0.9 million and the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit

decreased

by

$232.7 million

, or

6.0%

, to

$3.653 billion

in

Fiscal 2020

, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of

$53.7 million

. The decline in gross profit reflects adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including incremental inventory charges of

$157.3 million

. Gross profit during

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

also reflected inventory charges of

$2.2 million

and

$7.2 million

, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues

decreased

to

59.3%

in

Fiscal 2020

from

61.6%

in

Fiscal 2019

.


The

230 basis point

decline

was primarily driven by higher inventory charges and deleverage on lower net revenues, partially offset by favorable geographic, channel, and product mix, improved pricing, and lower levels of promotional activity.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

SG&A expenses include compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, rent and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A expenses

increased

by

$69.2 million

, or

2.2%

, to

$3.238 billion

in

Fiscal 2020

, including net favorable foreign currency effect of

$35.5 million

. The increase in SG&A expenses reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including incremental bad debt expense of

$56.4 million

. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues

increased

to

52.6%

in

Fiscal 2020

from

50.2%

in

Fiscal 2019

. The

240 basis point

increase

was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues and higher bad debt expense, both primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins).

The

$69.2 million

net increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are carefully managing our expense structure across all areas of spend, including temporarily postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities. However, we remain committed to spending on key strategic initiatives including marketing, digital, expanding and renovating our global retail stores and concession shops, and investing in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. We expect to make these investments while continuing to manage our cost base with discipline.

Impairment of Assets.

During

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of

$31.6 million

and

$21.2 million

, respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets in connection with our restructuring plans and identification of underperforming stores. Additionally, as a result of our decision to sell our corporate jet in connection with our cost savings initiative, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of

$4.6 million

during

Fiscal 2019

to reduce the carrying value of the asset held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. See

Note 8

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Restructuring and Other Charges.

During

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

, we recorded restructuring charges of

$37.6 million

and

$93.6 million

, respectively, in connection with our restructuring plans, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as a loss on sale of property during the prior fiscal year period. Additionally, during

Fiscal 2020

, we recorded other charges of

$29.6 million

primarily related to the charitable donation of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of our corporate jet, and rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. During

Fiscal 2019

, we recorded other charges of

$36.5 million

primarily related to our sabbatical leave program initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, depreciation expense associated with our former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, and a customs audit. See

Note 9

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


Operating Income.

Operating income

decreased

by

$244.8 million

, or

43.6%

, to

$317.0 million

in

Fiscal 2020

, including net unfavorable foreign currency effect of

$18.2 million

. The decline in operating income reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including total incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense of

$213.7 million

, as previously discussed. Our operating results during

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling

$101.0 million

and

$163.1 million

, respectively, as previously discussed. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues

decreased

to

5.1%

in

Fiscal 2020

from

8.9%

in

Fiscal 2019

. The

380 basis point

decline

was primarily driven by the decline in our gross margin and the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by lower restructuring-related charges recorded during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, all as previously discussed.

Operating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:

North America operating margin

declined

by


basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 440 basis points related to incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions. The remaining 140 basis point decline largely related to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Europe operating margin

declined

by


basis points, primarily due to the net unfavorable impact of 210 basis points related to incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by lower non-cash charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decline in operating margin also reflected a 40 basis point decline largely related to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a 20 basis point decline related unfavorable foreign currency.

Asia operating margin

declined

by


basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 160 basis points related to incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions. The remaining 160 basis point decline largely related to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and Hong Kong protests.

Unallocated corporate expenses

decreased

by

$14.7 million

to

$648.7 million

in

Fiscal 2020

. The

decline

in unallocated corporate expenses was due to lower compensation-related expenses of $11.5 million, lower staff-related expenses of $8.8 million, lower consulting fees of $6.7 million, and lower marketing and advertising expenses of $5.9 million, partially offset by lower intercompany sourcing commission income of $10.2 million (which is offset at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation) and higher other expenses of $8.0 million.

Unallocated restructuring and other charges

decreased

by

$62.9 million

to

$67.2 million

in

Fiscal 2020

, as previously discussed above and in

Note 9

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.

Non-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income (expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses. During

Fiscal 2020

, we reported non-operating income, net, of

$9.4 million

, as compared to

$20.7 million

in

Fiscal 2019

. The

$11.3 million

decline was primarily driven by:

•

an

$8.0 million

increase in other expense, net, driven by a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment. See

Note 8

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements; and

•

a

$6.4 million

decrease in interest income driven by the lower balance of our investment portfolio, as well as lower interest rates in financial markets during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year.

Income Tax Benefit (Provision).

The income tax benefit (provision) represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. We reported an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of

$57.9 million

and

(17.7%)

, respectively, in Fiscal 2020, as compared to an income tax provision and effective tax rate of

$151.6 million

and

26.0%

, respectively, in

Fiscal 2019

. The

$209.5 million

decline

in the income tax provision was largely driven by lower pretax income primarily due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions. The decline in our income provision also reflected a one-time benefit of

$122.9 million

recorded in Fiscal 2020 in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, which lowered our effective tax rate by

3,760 basis points

, as well as the absence of a

$27.6 million

TCJA enactment-related charge recorded in the prior fiscal year, which negatively impacted our prior fiscal year effective tax rate by

470 basis points

. In addition to this combined 4,230 basis point improvement related to tax reform impacts, the decline in our effective tax rate also reflected the net favorable impact of 140 basis points primarily attributable to other factors, including the tax impacts of earnings in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S. and favorable provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits. Our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. See

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act and TCJA.

Net Income.

Net income

decreased

to

$384.3 million

in

Fiscal 2020

, from

$430.9 million

in

Fiscal 2019

. The

$46.6 million

decline

in net income was primarily due to the decrease in our operating income, partially offset by the decrease in our income tax provision, both as previously discussed. Net income during

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

reflected a one-time income tax benefit of

$122.9 million

recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform

and

TCJA enactment-related charges of

$27.6 million

, respectively, both as previously discussed. Our operating results during

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets (including an equity method investment), and certain other charges (including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions) totaling

$321.8 million

and

$163.1 million

, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by

$244.8 million

and

$129.0 million

, respectively.

Net Income per Diluted Share.

Net income per diluted share decreased to

$4.98

in

Fiscal 2020

, from

$5.27

in

Fiscal 2019

. The

$0.29

per share

decline

was due to the lower level of net income, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during

Fiscal 2020

driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share in

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

were favorably impacted by

$1.59

per share as a result of a one-time income tax benefit recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act and negatively impacted by

$0.34

per share as a result of TCJA enactment-related charges, respectively, both as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share in

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

were also negatively impacted by

$3.17

per share and

$1.58

per share, respectively, as a result of restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets (including an equity method investment), and certain other charges (including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions), as previously discussed.


Fiscal 2019

Compared to

Fiscal 2018

The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions. All percentages shown in the below table and the discussion that follows have been calculated using unrounded numbers.

(a)

Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax provision by income before income taxes.

NM    Not meaningful.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by $130.7 million, or 2.1%, to $6.313 billion in Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $42.0 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $172.7 million, or 2.8%.

The following table summarizes the percentage change in our Fiscal 2019 consolidated comparable store sales as compared to the prior fiscal year:


Our global average store count increased by 34 stores and concession shops during Fiscal 2019 compared with the prior fiscal year, largely driven by new openings in Asia. The following table details our retail store presence by segment as of the periods presented:

In addition to our stores, we sold products online in North America and Europe through our various digital commerce sites, which include www.RalphLauren.com and www.ClubMonaco.com, among others. In Asia, we sold products online through our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018, as well as through various third-party digital partner commerce sites.

Net revenues for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's net revenues from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:

North America net revenues

— Net revenues decreased by $28.1 million, or 0.9%, during Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $3.3 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $24.8 million, or 0.8%.

The $28.1 million net decline in North America net revenues was driven by a $57.0 million net decrease related to our North America wholesale business, largely driven by a strategic reduction of shipments (including within the off-price channel) and points of distribution in connection with our long-term growth strategy.

This decline was partially offset by:

•

a $28.9 million net increase related to our North America retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $1.8 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $30.7 million driven by an increase of $30.3 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our North America retail business:


Europe net revenues

— Net revenues increased by $74.7 million, or 4.6%, during Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $27.7 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $102.4 million, or 6.4%.

The $74.7 million net increase in Europe net revenues was driven by:

•

a $51.5 million net increase related to our Europe wholesale business largely driven by stronger demand, partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $18.2 million; and

•

a $23.2 million net increase related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $9.5 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $32.7 million driven by an increase of $38.6 million in non-comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Europe retail business:

Asia net revenues

— Net revenues increased by $107.3 million, or 11.5%, during Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $10.9 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $118.2 million, or 12.7%.

The $107.3 million net increase in Asia net revenues was driven by:

•

a $95.6 million net increase related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $9.1 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $104.7 million, reflecting increases of $65.3 million in non-comparable store sales and $39.4 million in comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Asia retail business:

•

an $11.7 million net increase related to our Asia wholesale business, primarily driven by our expansion in Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased by $134.3 million, or 3.6%, to $3.886 billion in Fiscal 2019. Gross profit during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 reflected inventory charges of $7.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. The increase in gross profit also included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $15.2 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 61.6% in Fiscal 2019 from 60.7% in Fiscal 2018. The 90 basis point increase was primarily driven by improved pricing and lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy, and favorable product and geographic mix, partially offset by higher inventory reserves.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

SG&A expenses increased by $72.8 million, or 2.4%, to $3.168 billion in Fiscal 2019. This increase included a net favorable foreign currency effect of $17.4 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly to 50.2% in Fiscal 2019 from 50.1% in Fiscal 2018. The 10 basis point increase was primarily due to our increased marketing investment, new store expansion, and the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins). These increases were partially offset by our operational discipline.


The $72.8 million net increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:

Impairment of Assets.

During Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $21.2 million and $41.2 million, respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets related to our restructuring plans and identification of underperforming stores. Additionally, as a result of our decision to sell our corporate jet, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.6 million during Fiscal 2019 to reduce the carrying value of the asset held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. During Fiscal 2018, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 million to reduce the carrying value of a certain intangible asset to its estimated fair value as a result of a change in the planned usage of the asset. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Restructuring and Other Charges.

During Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $93.6 million and $79.2 million, respectively, in connection with our restructuring plans, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, and lease termination and store closure costs. In addition, during Fiscal 2019, we recorded other charges of $36.5 million primarily related to our sabbatical leave program initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, depreciation expense associated with our former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, and a customs audit. During Fiscal 2018, we recorded other net charges of $28.8 million primarily related to depreciation expense associated with our former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, a customs audit, the departure of Mr. Stefan Larsson, and the reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of certain non-income tax issues. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased by $63.6 million, or 12.8%, to $561.8 million in Fiscal 2019. Our operating results during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $163.1 million and $165.6 million, respectively, as previously discussed. Foreign currency effects did not have a meaningful impact on operating income during Fiscal 2019. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased to 8.9% in Fiscal 2019 from 8.1% in Fiscal 2018. The 80 basis point increase was primarily driven by the increase in our gross profit margin, partially offset by the slight increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, all as previously discussed.


Operating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:

North America operating margin

improved by 30 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of 50 basis points related to our wholesale business, largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in our gross profit margin. Partially offsetting this increase was 20 basis points attributable to unfavorable channel mix.

Europe operating margin

improved by 90 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impacts of 80 basis points related to foreign currency effects and 60 basis points related to our retail business, largely driven by an increase in our gross profit margin. The increase in operating margin also reflected a favorable impact of 10 basis points related to channel mix. Partially offsetting these increases in our operating margin was a 40 basis point unfavorable impact related to higher non-cash charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as a 20 basis point decline related to our wholesale business, largely driven by a decrease in our gross profit margin, partially offset by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues.

Asia operating margin

improved by 80 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impacts of 50 basis points related to our wholesale business and 30 basis points related to our retail business, both largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit margin.

Unallocated corporate expenses

decreased by $9.4 million to $663.4 million in Fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower impairment of asset charges of $14.8 million and lower compensation-related expenses of $8.4 million, partially offset by higher consulting fees of $6.1 million, higher marketing and advertising expenses of $5.1 million, and higher other expenses of $2.6 million.

Unallocated restructuring and other charges

increased by $22.1 million to $130.1 million in Fiscal 2019, as previously discussed above and in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.

During Fiscal 2019, we reported non-operating income, net, of $20.7 million, as compared to non-operating expense, net, of $9.0 million in Fiscal 2018. The $29.7 million improvement was primarily driven by higher interest income of $28.5 million due to the increased balance of our investment portfolio, as well as a favorable shift to higher interest rate environments attributable to cash repatriations from our foreign subsidiaries.

Income Tax Provision.

The income tax provision and effective tax rate in Fiscal 2019 were $151.6 million and 26.0%, respectively, as compared to $326.4 million and 66.7%, respectively, in Fiscal 2018. The $174.8 million decline in the income tax provision was primarily due to lower TCJA enactment-related charges recorded during Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by the increase in pretax income. During Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, we recorded TCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million and $221.4 million, respectively, which increased our effective tax rates by 470 basis points and 4,520 basis points, respectively. In addition to this 4,050 basis point improvement attributable to lower TCJA enactment-related charges recorded, the decline in our effective tax rate also reflected the net favorable impact of 20 basis points due to other factors, including a net favorable change related to compensation-related adjustments, partially offset by the tax impact of the change in geographic


mix of our worldwide earnings. See

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the TCJA.

Net Income.

Net income increased to $430.9 million in Fiscal 2019, from $162.8 million in Fiscal 2018. The $268.1 million increase in net income was primarily due to the decrease in our income tax provision and the increases in operating income and interest income, all as previously discussed. Net income during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 reflected TCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million and $221.4 million, respectively, as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $163.1 million and $165.6 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $129.0 million and $113.3 million, respectively.

Net Income per Diluted Share.

Net income per diluted share increased to $5.27 in Fiscal 2019, from $1.97 in Fiscal 2018. The $3.30 per share increase was due to the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal 2019 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by $0.34 per share and $2.68 per share, respectively, as a result of TCJA enactment-related charges. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were also negatively impacted by $1.58 per share and $1.38 per share, respectively, as a result of restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges, as previously discussed.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Financial Condition

The following table presents our financial condition as of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

.

(a)

Recorded within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

(b)

See

Note 11

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt.

(c)

"Net cash and investments" is defined as cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt.

The decrease in our net cash and investments position at

March 28, 2020

as compared to

March 30, 2019

was primarily due to our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of

$694.8 million

, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through

$270.3 million

in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of

$203.9 million

, partially offset by our operating cash flows of

$754.6 million

.

The decrease in equity was primarily attributable to our share repurchase activity, dividends declared, and cumulative adjustments from our adoption of new accounting standards, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during

Fiscal 2020

.


Cash Flows

Fiscal 2020

Compared to

Fiscal 2019

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to

$754.6 million

during

Fiscal 2020

, from

$783.8 million

during

Fiscal 2019

. The

$29.2 million

net decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:

•

a favorable change related to our inventories, largely driven by higher inventory charges primarily related to adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions;

•

a favorable change related to our prepaid expenses and other current assets, largely driven by the timing of cash payments; and

•

a favorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by lower wholesale sales during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year driven by COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as the timing of cash receipts.

These increases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:

•

an unfavorable change related to our income tax receivables and payables, largely as a result of the absence of charges recorded during the prior fiscal year in connection with the TCJA's mandatory transition tax; and

•

an unfavorable change related to our accrued liabilities driven by larger decreases in our bonus accrual and restructuring reserves as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as the timing of cash payments.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.

Net cash provided by investing activities was

$702.1 million

during

Fiscal 2020

, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of

$879.3 million

during

Fiscal 2019

. The

$1.581 billion

net increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by:

•

a

$1.624 billion

increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During

Fiscal 2020

, we received net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of

$950.7 million

, as compared to making net investment purchases of

$673.3 million

during

Fiscal 2019

; and

•

a

$23.8 million

decrease in payments made to settle net investment hedges.

These increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by:

•

a

$72.6 million

increase in capital expenditures. During

Fiscal 2020

, we spent

$270.3 million

on capital expenditures, as compared to

$197.7 million

during

Fiscal 2019

. Our capital expenditures during

Fiscal 2020

primarily related to new store openings, retail and department store renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems, and the consolidation of our corporate office footprint.


In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are temporarily postponing non-critical capital expenditures as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity. However, we remain committed to expanding and renovating our global store fleet and investing in our digital ecosystem.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net cash used in financing activities was

$438.2 million

during

Fiscal 2020

, as compared to

$605.7 million

during

Fiscal 2019

. The

$167.5 million

net decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:

•

a

$386.8 million

increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During

Fiscal 2020

, we borrowed

$475.0 million

under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During Fiscal 2019, we received $398.1 million in proceeds from our issuance of 3.750% unsecured senior notes in August 2018, a portion of which was used to repay $300.0 million of our 2.125% unsecured senior notes that matured in September 2018. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019 we repaid approximately $10 million that had been borrowed under our credit facilities during Fiscal 2018.

This decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by:

•

a

$192.2 million

increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During

Fiscal 2020

, we used

$650.3 million

to repurchase shares of Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional

$44.5 million

in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during

Fiscal 2019

,

$470.0 million

in shares of Class A common stock were repurchased and

$32.6 million

in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes;

•

a

$21.8 million

decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options; and

•

a

$13.2 million

increase in payments of dividends, driven by an increase to the quarterly cash dividend per share (as discussed within "

Dividends

" below). Dividends paid amounted to

$203.9 million

and

$190.7 million

during

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

, respectively.

Fiscal 2019

Compared to

Fiscal 2018

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $783.8 million during Fiscal 2019, from $975.1 million during Fiscal 2018. The $191.3 million net decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by an increase in net income before non-cash charges. The net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:

•

a year-over-year increase in our inventory levels largely to support revenue growth, as well as the timing of inventory receipts;

•

an unfavorable change related to our income tax payable, largely a result of the decrease in charges recorded in connection with the TCJA's mandatory transition tax as compared to the prior fiscal year;

•

an unfavorable change related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities largely driven by fluctuations associated with our derivative instruments; and


•

unfavorable changes related to our accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, largely driven by the timing of cash receipts and payments, respectively.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $879.3 million during Fiscal 2019, as compared to $189.1 million during Fiscal 2018. The $690.2 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:

•

a $650.4 million increase in purchases of investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. During Fiscal 2019, we made net investment purchases of $673.3 million, as compared to $22.9 million during Fiscal 2018;

•

a $36.1 million increase in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2019, we spent $197.7 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $161.6 million during Fiscal 2018. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2019 primarily related to new store openings, retail and department store renovations, and enhancements to our information technology systems; and

•

a $23.8 million increase in payments made to settle net investment hedges.

These increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by cash proceeds of $20.0 million from the sale of one of our distribution centers in North America during Fiscal 2019.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $605.7 million during Fiscal 2019, as compared to $197.5 million during Fiscal 2018. The $408.2 million net increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:

•

a $485.5 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2019, we used $470.0 million to repurchase shares of Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $32.6 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2018, no shares of Class A common stock were repurchased and $17.1 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes; and

•

a $28.3 million increase in payments of dividends, driven by an increase to the quarterly cash dividend per share. Dividends paid amounted to $190.7 million and $162.4 million during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.

These increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by:

•

a $78.1 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During Fiscal 2019, we received $398.1 million in proceeds from our issuance of 3.750% unsecured senior notes in August 2018, a portion of which was used to repay $300.0 million of our 2.125% unsecured senior notes that matured in September 2018. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019 we repaid approximately $10 million that had been borrowed under our credit facilities during Fiscal 2018; and

•

a $21.7 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options.

Sources of Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, availability under our credit facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options.

During

Fiscal 2020

, we generated

$754.6 million

of net cash flows from our operations. As of

March 28, 2020

, we had

$2.116 billion

in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which

$587.9 million

were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax as of December 31, 2017 are not considered to be permanently reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax. However, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to applicable U.S. and foreign taxes.


The following table presents our total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit facilities and Commercial Paper Program as of

March 28, 2020

:

(a)

As defined in

Note 11

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(b)

Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, we do not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Global Credit Facility to exceed $500 million.

(c)

Includes

$9.0 million

of outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the Global Credit Facility as of

March 28, 2020

.

We believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of

March 28, 2020

, there were eight financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to

$1 billion

through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. Further, in May 2020, we entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional

$500 million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit and matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating regional branches of JPMorgan Chase (the "Banks"), subject to availability of the Banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility and the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future.

Our sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, payment of dividends, debt repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as our recent temporary store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations.

See

Note 11

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.

Debt and Covenant Compliance

In August 2015, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued

$300 million

aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due

August 18, 2020

, which bear interest at a fixed rate of

2.625%

, payable semi-annually (the "2.625% Senior Notes"). In August 2018, we completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional

$400 million

aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due

September 15, 2025

, which bear interest at a fixed rate of

3.750%

, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes").


The indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the "Indenture") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.

We have a credit facility that provides for a

$500 million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit through

August 12, 2024

, also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the "Global Credit Facility"). Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to expand the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to

$1 billion

, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. Further, in May 2020, we entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional

$500 million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.

In March 2020, we borrowed

$475.0 million

under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These borrowings have been classified as short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of

March 28, 2020

. We were also contingently liable for

$9.0 million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in remaining availability under the Global Credit Facility of

$16.0 million

as of

March 28, 2020

.

The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in

Note 11

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of

March 28, 2020

, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.

See

Note 11

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

On

May 13, 2019

, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase up to an additional

$600 million

of Class A common stock. As of

March 28, 2020

, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately

$580 million

. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. Accordingly, as a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity.

See

Note 16

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase program.

Dividends

Since 2003, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock. On

May 13, 2019

, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from

$0.625

to

$0.6875

per share.

As a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended our quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.

See

Note 16

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program.


Contractual and Other Obligations

Firm Commitments

The following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of

March 28, 2020

, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. We expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing.

The following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of

March 28, 2020

:

•

Senior Notes

represent the principal amount of our outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);

•

Borrowings under credit facilities

represents the principal amount outstanding under our Global Credit Facility. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);

•

Interest payments on debt

represent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes and the interest payments due on the borrowings under our Global Credit Facility.  Amounts do not include the impact of potential cash flows underlying our related swap contracts (see

Note 13

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our swap contracts);

•

Lease obligations

represent fixed payments due over the lease term of our noncancelable leases of real estate and operating equipment, including rent, real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs. For lease terms that have commenced, information has been presented separately for operating and finance leases. Other lease commitments relate to executed lease agreements for which the related lease terms have not yet commenced;

•

Inventory purchase commitments

represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices;

•

Mandatory transition tax payments

represent our remaining tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the TCJA (see

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the TCJA); and

•

Other commitments

primarily represent our legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.


Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of

$88.9 million

as of

March 28, 2020

, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) other than lease obligations and mandatory transition tax payments, amounts recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of

March 28, 2020

, which will be paid within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred income), or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a "purchase obligation" as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes, derivative financial instruments, and other miscellaneous items).

We also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. See

Note 15

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit amounted to

$9.0 million

as of

March 28, 2020

. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

As discussed in

Note 13

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage such risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

Given our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of

March 28, 2020

. However, we do have in aggregate $56.6 million of derivative instruments in net asset positions with seven creditworthy financial institutions.

Foreign Currency Risk Management

We manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. Refer to

Note 13

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments for the fiscal periods presented.

Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

We enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally hedge a portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.

Our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels,


transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses.

Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent such contracts are designated as qualifying cash flow hedges of inventory transactions, related gains or losses are initially deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations when the related inventory is sold.

Cross-Currency Swap Contracts

During our fiscal year ended April 2, 2016 ("Fiscal 2016"), we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swaps with notional amounts of €280 million and €274 million which we designated as hedges of our net investment in certain of our European subsidiaries. The €280 million notional cross-currency swap, which was settled during the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, swapped the U.S. Dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a fixed spread (as paid under the 2.125% Interest Rate Swap discussed below) for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") plus a fixed spread, which, in combination with the 2.125% Interest Rate Swap, economically converted our previously-outstanding $300 million fixed-rate 2.125% Senior Notes obligation to a €280 million floating-rate Euro-denominated obligation. Similarly, the €274 million notional cross-currency swap, which matures on August 18, 2020, swaps the U.S. Dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread (as paid under the 2.625% Interest Rate Swap discussed below) for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month EURIBOR plus a fixed spread, which, in combination with the 2.625% Interest Rate Swap, economically converts our $300 million fixed-rate 2.625% Senior Notes obligation to a €274 million floating-rate Euro-denominated obligation.

Additionally, in August 2018, we entered into pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of €346 million which we designated as hedges of our net investment in certain of our European subsidiaries. These contracts, which mature on September 15, 2025, swap the U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments on our 3.750% Senior Notes for Euro-denominated 1.29% fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting our $400 million fixed-rate 3.750% Senior Notes obligation to a €346 million fixed-rate 1.29% Euro-denominated obligation.

Sensitivity

We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. In doing so, we assess the risk of loss in the fair values of these contracts that would result from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of

March 28, 2020

, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $123 million. This hypothetical net change in fair value should ultimately be largely offset by the net change in fair values of the underlying hedged items.

Interest Rate Risk Management

During Fiscal 2016, we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts which we designated as hedges against changes in the respective fair values of our previously-outstanding fixed-rate 2.125% Senior Notes and our fixed-rate 2.625% Senior Notes attributed to changes in a benchmark interest rate. The interest rate swap related to the 2.125% Senior Notes (the "2.125% Interest Rate Swap"), which matured on September 26, 2018 concurrent with the maturity of the related debt, had a notional amount of $300 million and swapped the fixed interest rate on the 2.125% Senior Notes for a variable interest rate based on 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The interest rate swap related to the 2.625% Senior Notes (the "2.625% Interest Rate Swap"), which matures on August 18, 2020 and also has a notional amount of $300 million, swaps the fixed interest rate on the 2.625% Senior Notes for a variable interest rate based on 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread.

Sensitivity

As of

March 28, 2020

, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. As such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to changes in the fair values of our fixed-rate Senior Notes. As of

March 28, 2020

, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes were

$714.9 million

. A 25-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes by approximately $5 million based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder


of the period. Such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be realized if we were to retire all or a portion of the debt prior to its maturity.

Investment Risk Management

As of

March 28, 2020

, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of

$1.620 billion

, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included

$495.9 million

of short-term investments, consisting of investments in time deposits and commercial paper with original maturities greater than 90 days; and

$9.4 million

of restricted cash held in escrow with certain banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax matters and real estate leases.

We actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See

Note 13

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of

March 28, 2020

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that the following list represents our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, see

Note 3

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts

A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, revenue related to our wholesale business is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Revenue related to our retail business, including digital commerce sales, is also reduced by an estimate of returns.

In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and cooperative advertising allowances, we analyze historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances as of

March 28, 2020

would have decreased our

Fiscal 2020

net revenues by approximately $2 million.

Similarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts (including consideration of their financial condition and ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions), a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category, and current economic and market conditions. Based on this information, we provide a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for those risks as part of our bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business operations, such as those resulting from business disruptions caused by disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows, and/or financial condition. A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of

March 28, 2020

would have increased our

Fiscal 2020

SG&A expenses by approximately $1 million.

See "Accounts Receivable" in

Note 3

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.


Inventories

We hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. We also hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. Substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.

The estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our factory stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and economic and market conditions. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates.

A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of

March 28, 2020

would have decreased our

Fiscal 2020

gross profit by approximately $3 million.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable.

We generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. However, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we periodically perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.

Performance of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. This requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. We also give consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was performed. If the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.

The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. However, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of the respective reporting unit's allocated goodwill.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including an assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons, and recent transactions. These approaches involve significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in those future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and selection of appropriate market comparable metrics and transactions.


We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of

Fiscal 2020

using the qualitative approach discussed above, while giving consideration to our then-most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test (the results of which indicated that the fair values of our reporting units with allocated goodwill significantly exceeded their respective carrying values). Based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment performed, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.

Subsequent to performing our Fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment assessment, we determined that indicators of impairment were present during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 as a result of adverse business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of our stores in North America, Europe, and Asia. As a result, we performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of goodwill assigned to our reporting units using a quantitative approach as of March 28, 2020. The estimated fair values of our reporting units were determined with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. Based on the results of the quantitative impairment assessment, we concluded that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and were not at risk of impairment. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. See

Note 12

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

In evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition where probable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions.

During Fiscal 2018, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 million as a result of a change in the planned usage of a certain intangible asset to reduce the value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. There were no other finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded during any of the fiscal periods presented. See

Note 8

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. Such changes could result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment and lease-related right-of-use ("ROU") assets, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets) and its eventual disposition, where applicable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.

In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. For example, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could negatively impact consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences and result in actual results differing from our estimates. Additionally, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, where applicable.

During

Fiscal 2020

,

Fiscal 2019

, and

Fiscal 2018

, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $38.7 million,

$21.2 million

, and

$41.2 million

, respectively, to write-down the carrying values of certain long-lived assets based upon their assumed fair values. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019, we recorded a non-cash charge of $4.6 million to reduce the carrying value of a certain asset held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. See

Note 8

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.


Income Taxes

In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we consider that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically involves the use of significant estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances.

See

Note 10

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.

Contingencies

We are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, alleged information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.

Stock-Based Compensation

We expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

We have granted restricted shares of our Class A common stock to our non-employee directors and grant service-based RSUs to certain of our senior executives and other employees, as well as to our non-employee directors. In addition, we grant RSUs with performance-based and market-based vesting conditions to such senior executives and other key employees.

The fair values of our restricted stock, service-based RSU, and performance-based RSU awards are measured based on the fair value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Related compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the employees' requisite service period, to the extent that our attainment of performance goals (upon which vesting is dependent) is deemed probable, and involves judgment as to expectations surrounding our achievement of certain defined operating performance metrics.


The fair value of our market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return ("TSR") of our Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is measured on the grant date based on estimated projections of our relative TSR over the performance period. These estimates are made using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of our Class A common stock and that of the peer group to evaluate and determine our ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Related compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. See

Note 18

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Stock Options

Stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of both subjective and objective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual results.

No stock options were granted during any of the fiscal years presented. See

Note 18

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Sensitivity

The assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of our stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. In addition, projecting the achievement level of certain performance-based awards, as well as estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited, requires judgment. If actual results or forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, or if assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of future stock-based award grants are significantly changed, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be materially impacted. A hypothetical 10% change in our

Fiscal 2020

stock-based compensation expense would have affected net income by approximately $9 million.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See

Note 4

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued accounting standards which have impacted our consolidated financial statements, or may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, see "Market Risk Management" in Item 7 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

See the "Index to Consolidated Financial Statements" appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

Not applicable.


Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company's assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as included elsewhere herein.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

Except as discussed below, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of

Fiscal 2020

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

In addition to the changes discussed below, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities beginning during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, as described within

"Recent Developments."

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken various preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity, including temporarily furloughing and/or reducing work hours for a significant portion of both our store and corporate employees, with those corporate employees not furloughed in affected regions working remotely. Despite such actions, we have not experienced any material changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate and monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our internal controls. See Item 1A —

"Risk Factors — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business"

for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.


Leases

In connection with our adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of the beginning of the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, changes were made to certain lease-related processes and control activities, including information systems, in order to monitor and maintain appropriate controls over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as our lease-related processes and procedures evolve. See

Note 4

to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our adoption of ASU 2016-02.

Implementation and Reconfiguration of Financial Reporting Systems

In connection with our initiative to integrate and upgrade our global systems and processes, we migrated our Asia operations to a new financial reporting information technology system, Microsoft AX Dynamics 365, in Fiscal 2020. In addition to this system implementation, during Fiscal 2020, we began reconfiguring the financial reporting information technology system used by our Europe operations, SAP, in order to utilize enhanced financial reporting functionality.

As a result of these actions, we expect to experience certain changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. While we expect these system changes to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as processes and procedures in each of the affected areas evolve. For a discussion of risks related to the implementation of new systems, see Item 1A — "

Risk Factors — Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.

"

Description of Business

Ralph Lauren Corporation ("RLC") is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. RLC's long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. RLC's brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, Chaps, and Club Monaco, among others. RLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the "Company," "we," "us," "our," and "ourselves," unless the context indicates otherwise.

The Company diversifies its business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows the Company to maintain a dynamic balance as its operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. The Company sells directly to consumers through its integrated retail channel, which includes its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. The Company's wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which the Company has licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using its trademarks. In addition, the Company licenses to third parties for specified periods the right to access its various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.

The Company organizes its business into the following

three

reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments. See

Note 20

for further discussion of the Company's segment reporting structure.

"); and fiscal year


will end on March 27, 2021 and will be a 52-week period ("Fiscal


").

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include reserves for bad debt, customer returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances; the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation and other contingencies; useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; fair value measurements; accounting for income taxes and related uncertain tax positions; valuation of stock-based compensation awards and related forfeiture rates; reserves for restructuring activity; and accounting for business combinations, among others.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial information in order to conform to the current period's presentation, including a change to the Company's segment reporting structure as further described in

Note 20

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue across all channels of the business when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create variability in the amount of consideration that the Company ultimately expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services, and is subject to an overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales and other related taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.

Revenue from the Company's retail business is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of the products, which occurs either at the point of sale for merchandise purchased at the Company's retail stores and concession-based shop-within-shops, or upon receipt of shipment for merchandise ordered through direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. Such revenues are recorded net of estimated returns based on historical trends. Payment is due at the point of sale.

Gift cards issued to customers by the Company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. The Company also estimates and recognizes revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed (referred to as "breakage") to the extent that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions.

Revenue from the Company's wholesale business is generally recognized upon shipment of products, at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. In certain arrangements where the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment, revenue is recognized upon receipt of products by the customer. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. The Company's historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results.

Revenue from the Company's licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to the Company's trademarks (i.e., symbolic intellectual property) and benefit from such access through their sales of licensed products. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements may be subject to a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are generally due quarterly and, depending on time of receipt, may be recorded as a liability until recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for providing access to its trademarks.

As of

March 28, 2020

, contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amounts expected to be recognized as revenue during future periods were as follows:

Deferred Income

Deferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company's transfer of control of products or services to its customers and is generally comprised of unredeemed gift cards, net of breakage, and advance royalty payments from licensees.

The Company's deferred income balances were

$

14.6

million

and

$

14.8

million

as of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

, respectively, and were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. During

Fiscal 2020

, the Company recognized

$

9.3

million

of net revenues from amounts recorded as deferred income as of

March 30, 2019

. The majority of the deferred income balance as of

March 28, 2020

is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months.

Cost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated as qualifying cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges ("handling costs"), are included in selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs (described above) billed to customers are included in revenue.

A summary of shipping and handling costs is as follows:

Advertising and Marketing Costs

Advertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Advertising costs paid to wholesale customers under cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising costs, but rather are reflected as a reduction of revenue since generally the benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of the Company's products by customers. Costs associated with the marketing and promotion of the Company's products are included within SG&A expenses.

Advertising and marketing expenses were

$

278.0

million

,

$

272.8

million

, and

$

241.1

million

in

Fiscal 2020

,

Fiscal 2019

, and

Fiscal 2018

, respectively. Deferred advertising, marketing, and promotional costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet been exhibited or services that have not yet been received, were

$

10.1

million

and

$

9.6

million

at the end of

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

, respectively, and were recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and operating results of the Company's foreign operations are accounted for in their respective functional currencies, which are primarily consistent with the local currency. For purposes of consolidation, local currency assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. Dollars at the rates of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. The resulting translation gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") and in the consolidated statements of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Gains and losses on the translation of intercompany loans made to foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term investment nature are also included within this component of equity.

F-10

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company also recognizes gains and losses on both third-party and intercompany balances that are denominated in a currency other than the respective entity's functional currency. Such foreign currency transactional gains and losses are recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, inclusive of the effects of any related hedging activities, and reflected net losses of

$

1.1

million

and

$

2.8

million

in

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

, respectively, and net gains of

$

4.5

million

in

Fiscal 2018

.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income, which is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of equity, consists of net income and certain other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income and referred to as OCI. Components of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains (losses); net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts; net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments; and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) related to the Company's defined benefit plans.

Net Income per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock. Diluted net income per common share adjusts basic net income per common share for the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units ("RSUs"), stock options, and any other potentially dilutive instruments, only in the periods in which such effects are dilutive.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share as follows:

All earnings per share amounts have been calculated using unrounded numbers.

The Company has outstanding performance-based and market-based RSUs, which are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance or market conditions (i) have been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive. In addition, options to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price greater than the average market price of the common stock during the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of diluted net income per common share.

As of the end of

Fiscal 2020

,

Fiscal 2019

, and

Fiscal 2018

, there were

0.8

million

,

1.4

million

, and

2.0

million

, respectively, of additional shares issuable contingent on vesting of performance-based RSUs and upon exercise of anti-dilutive options, that were excluded from the diluted shares calculations.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.  The grant date fair value of the Company's market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return ("TSR") of its Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant date fair values of restricted stock awards, service-based RSUs, and performance-based RSUs are determined based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of any stock option awards. Compensation expense for all performance-based RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period when attainment of the performance goal is deemed

F-11

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

probable, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense for market-based RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. The Company recognizes compensation expense on an accelerated basis for all awards with graded vesting terms, including restricted stock, certain RSUs, and stock options. For RSU awards with cliff vesting terms, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. For certain RSU awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, the related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over a term commensurate with the period that the employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award. See

Note 18

for further discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including investments in time deposits and debt securities. Investments in debt securities are diversified across high-credit quality issuers in accordance with the Company's risk-management policies.

Restricted Cash

The Company is periodically required to place cash in escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees of corresponding amounts made by the banks to international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain international tax audits, as well as to secure guarantees related to certain real estate leases. Such cash is classified as restricted cash and reported as a component of either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Investments

The Company's investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company's investment policy.

Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year, including time deposits and debt securities, which have original maturities greater than 90 days. Non-current investments, which are classified within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets, consist of those investments which the Company does not expect to convert into cash within one year.

The Company classifies all of its investments at the time of purchase as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses classified as a component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses recorded within income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and purchase of investments are classified as investing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.

Equity-method Investments

Investment ownership interests that provide the Company with significant influence, but less than a controlling interest, over an investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of the investee.

Under the equity method of accounting, the following amounts are generally recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements: the Company's original investment, as subsequently adjusted for its share of the investee's earnings (losses) and reduced by any dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments recorded, is included in the consolidated balance sheets; the Company's share of the investee's periodic earnings (losses) is included in the consolidated statements of operations; and dividends and other cash distributions received from the investee and additional cash investments made in or other cash paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Company's share of equity-method investee earnings and losses is recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations, and reflected net gains of

$

0.1

million

and

$

2.9

million

in

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

, respectively, and net losses of

$

4.5

million

in

Fiscal 2018

.

F-12

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Impairment Assessment

The Company evaluates its investments that are in unrealized loss positions, if any, and equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis (see

Note 12

). Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers or investees. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which an investment's fair value has been below its cost; (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) the length of time to maturity; (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (v) the Company's intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value; and (vii) whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's carrying amount might not be recoverable. See

Note 13

for further information relating to the Company's investments.

During Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a

$

7.1

million

impairment charge within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations relating to an equity method investment (see

Note 8

).

Accounts Receivable

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to wholesale customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Payment is generally due within

30 to 120 days

and does not include a significant financing component. Accounts receivable is recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and is presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets net of certain reserves and allowances. These reserves and allowances consist of (i) reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances (see the "

Revenue Recognition

" section above for further discussion of related accounting policies) and (ii) allowances for doubtful accounts.

A rollforward of the activity in the Company's reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances is presented below:

An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of accounts receivable aging, assessments of collectability based on evaluation of historical and anticipated trends, the financial condition of the Company's customers and their ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and evaluation of the impact of other economic and market conditions, among other factors.

The Company's estimated allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 28, 2020 reflects adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, which include temporary department and specialty store closures worldwide, as well as declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.

A rollforward of the activity in the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is presented below:

(a)

Amounts recorded to bad debt expense are included within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. In the Company's wholesale business, concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, the Company has

three

key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During

Fiscal 2020

, the Company's sales to its

three

largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately


%

of total net revenues. Substantially all of the Company's sales to its

three

largest wholesale customers related to its North America segment. As of

March 28, 2020

, these

three

key wholesale customers constituted approximately


%

of total gross accounts receivable.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold in its retail stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. The Company also holds inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners. Substantially all of the Company's inventories consist of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.

The estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company's individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current in-house orders for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through the Company's factory stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and actual economic and market conditions. In addition, reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. The Company's historical estimates of the realizable value of its inventory and its reserves for inventory shrinkage have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could result in the Company's actual results differing materially from its estimates.

The Company's estimated realizable value of its inventory as of March 28, 2020 reflects adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, which include temporary closures of the Company's stores and those of its wholesale customers worldwide, as well as declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets, which range from

three

to

seven years

for furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and capitalized software; and from

ten

to

forty years

for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the term of the related lease.

F-14

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see

Note 12

). In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-lived intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan for disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.

Leases

As discussed in

Note 4

, the Company adopted a new lease accounting standard as of the beginning of Fiscal 2020.

The Company's lease arrangements primarily relate to real estate, including its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, corporate offices, and warehouse facilities, and to a lesser extent, certain equipment and other assets. The Company's leases generally have initial terms ranging from

three

to

fifteen

years and may include renewal or early-termination options, rent escalation clauses, and/or lease incentives in the form of construction allowances and rent abatements. Renewal rent payment terms generally reflect market rates prevailing at the time of renewal. The Company is typically required to make fixed minimum rent payments, variable rent payments based on performance (e.g., percentage-of-sales-based payments), or a combination thereof, directly related to its right to use an underlying leased asset. The Company is also often required to pay for certain other costs that do not relate specifically to its right to use an underlying leased asset, but that are associated with the asset, including real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs (referred to collectively herein as "non-lease components"), which may be fixed or variable in amount, depending on the terms of the respective lease agreement. The Company's leases do not contain significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the arrangement's inception. If a lease is determined to exist, its related term is assessed at lease commencement, once the underlying asset is made available by the lessor for the Company's use. The Company's assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods and/or periods covered by early-termination options for which the Company is not considered reasonably certain of exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options for which it is considered reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance (formerly referred to as "capital") at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation thereof reflected in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.

For leases with a lease term exceeding 12 months, a lease liability is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement reflecting the present value of its fixed payment obligations over such term. A corresponding right-of-use ("ROU") asset equal to the initial lease liability is also recorded, increased by any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease, and reduced by any lease incentives received. The Company includes fixed payment obligations related to non-lease components in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities, as it elects to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Variable lease payments are not included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets associated with finance leases are presented separate from those associated with operating leases, and are included within property and equipment, net on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement, as rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a secured basis an amount equal to the lease payments and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease.

For operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the initial ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease liability, which is ultimately reduced by the related fixed payments as they are made. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (referred to as a "short-term lease"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. Variable lease cost, if any, is recognized as incurred for all leases.

ROU assets, along with any other related long-lived assets, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see

Note 12

). To the extent that an ROU asset and any related long-lived assets are determined to be impaired, they are written down accordingly on a relative carrying amount basis,

with the ROU asset written down to an amount no lower than its estimated fair value. Subsequent to the recognition of any such impairment, total remaining lease cost is recognized on a front-loaded basis over the remaining lease term.

See

Note 14

for further discussion of the Company's leases.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which typically consist of reacquired license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and/or order backlog. The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, both tangible and intangible, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. The Company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. Under the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. The Company also periodically performs a quantitative test to assess its goodwill for impairment in lieu of using the qualitative approach in order to reassess the fair values of its reporting units.

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See discussion of the Company's accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as previously described under the caption "

Property and Equipment, Net.

"

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable, and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that warrant adjustments.

In determining the income tax benefit (provision) for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Company's estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax benefit (provision) in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties are recorded within the income tax benefit (provision) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets together with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company records derivative financial instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are either (i) offset through earnings against the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments or (ii) recognized in equity as a component of AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the instrument is hedging against changes in fair value or cash flows and net investments, respectively.

Each derivative instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk associated with the related exposure. For each instrument that is designated as a hedge, the Company documents the related risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk exposure, as well as how hedge effectiveness will be assessed over the instrument's term. To assess hedge effectiveness at the inception of a hedging relationship, the Company generally uses regression analysis, a statistical method, to compare changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument to changes in the fair value or cash flows of the related hedged item. The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to remain highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is assessed by the Company on at least a quarterly basis.

Given its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk from derivative transactions include ongoing review and assessment of its counterparties' creditworthiness. The Company also enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. In the event of default or termination (as such terms are defined within the respective master netting arrangement), these arrangements allow the Company to net-settle amounts payable and receivable related to multiple derivative transactions with the same counterparty. The master netting arrangements specify a number of events of default and termination, including the failure to make timely payments.

The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. For cash flow reporting purposes, proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a derivative instrument are classified in the same manner as the related item being hedged, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency. To the extent designated as cash flow hedges, related gains or losses on such instruments are initially deferred in equity as a component of AOCI and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations when the related inventory is sold.

If a derivative instrument is dedesignated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the instrument is not expected to be highly effective in hedging the designated exposure, any further gains (losses) are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. Upon discontinuance of hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative instrument recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the related hedged item affects earnings, consistent with the hedging strategy, unless the related forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring, in which case the accumulated amount is immediately recognized in earnings within other income (expense), net.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company periodically uses cross-currency swap contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations on certain of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of such hedges, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related hedging instrument. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are amortized into earnings as interest expense using a systematic and rational method over the instrument's term. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e., those due to changes in the spot rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment.

Fair Value Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with offsetting changes in the fair value of the related hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings. To the extent that the change in the fair value of the hedged item does not fully offset the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument, the resulting net impact is reflected in earnings within the income statement line item associated with the hedged item.

Undesignated Hedges

The Company uses undesignated hedges primarily to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk related to third-party and intercompany balances and exposures. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Implementation Costs in Cloud Computing Arrangements

In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2018-15, "Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract" ("ASU 2018-15"). ASU 2018-15 addresses diversity in practice surrounding the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing hosting arrangement that is a service contract by establishing a model for capitalizing or expensing such costs, depending on their nature and the stage of the implementation project during which they are incurred. Any capitalized costs are to be amortized over the reasonably certain term of the hosting arrangement and presented in the same line within the statement of operations as the related service arrangement's fees. ASU 2018-15 also requires enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding hosting arrangements that are service contracts. ASU 2018-15 is effective for the Company beginning in its Fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted, and may be adopted on either a retrospective or prospective basis. Other than the new disclosure requirements, the Company does not currently expect that the adoption of ASU 2018-15 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, "Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" ("ASU 2018-02"). Existing accounting guidance requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax laws or rates to be included in net income, including the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to items recorded within AOCI. ASU 2018-02 provides an entity with the option to adjust AOCI for the "stranded" tax effect of such remeasurements resulting from the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") through a reclassification to retained earnings.

The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 as of the beginning of the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 and elected to reclassify the income tax effect stranded in AOCI related to the TCJA, inclusive of state income tax-related effects, resulting in a

$

4.9

million

increase to its opening retained earnings. The Company generally releases income tax effects from AOCI when the corresponding pretax AOCI items are reclassified to earnings.

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13, which was further updated and clarified by the FASB through issuance of additional related ASUs, amends the guidance surrounding measurement and recognition of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade receivables and investments in certain debt securities, by requiring upfront recognition of an allowance for credit losses expected to be incurred over an asset's lifetime based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and supportable forecasts impacting its ultimate collectibility. It is expected that application of this "expected loss" model will result in earlier recognition of credit losses than the current "as incurred" model, under which losses are recognized only upon occurrence of an event that gives rise to the incurrence of a probable loss. While the Company's historical bad debt write-off activity has generally been insignificant, similar to current practice, the extent of losses ultimately recognized will depend on prevailing

F-18

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

conditions and ongoing consideration of information and forecasts that inform assessments of collectability. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning in its Fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted, and is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases." ASU No. 2016-02, along with certain other ASUs that were subsequently issued to clarify and modify certain of its provisions (collectively "ASU 2016-02"), supersedes historical lease accounting guidance and requires that, among its provisions, a lessee's rights and fixed payment obligations under most leases be recognized as ROU assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet, initially measured based on the present value of its fixed payment obligations over the lease term. Under historical guidance, only those leases classified as capital were recognized on a lessee's balance sheet; operating leases were not recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 retains a dual model for classifying leases as either finance (formerly referred to as "capital") or operating, consistent with historical guidance, which governs the pattern of expense recognition reflected in the statement of operations over the lease term. Accordingly, recognition of lease expense in the statement of operations will not significantly change. Additionally, variable lease payments based on performance, such as percentage-of-sales-based payments, are not included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities and, consistent with historical practice, are recognized as an expense in the period incurred. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative lease-related disclosures.

The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 as of the beginning of the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 using a modified retrospective approach under which the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized as an adjustment to its opening retained earnings (discussed further below), with no restatement of prior year amounts. In connection therewith, the Company applied an optional package of practical expedients intended to ease transition to the standard for existing leases by, among its provisions, carrying forward its original lease classification conclusions without reassessment. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company recognized initial ROU asset and lease liability balances of approximately

$

1.60

billion

and

$

1.75

billion

, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet.

Additionally, in connection with its adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company recorded an adjustment to reduce its opening retained earnings balance by

$

131.6

million

, net of related income tax benefits, reflecting the impairment of an ROU asset for a certain real estate lease of which, under historical accounting guidance, the Company was previously deemed the owner for accounting purposes (commonly referred to as a "build-to-suit" lease arrangement). Specifically, although the Company no longer generates revenue or other cash flows from its rights underlying the leased asset given it no longer actively uses the space for commercial purposes, the asset was previously not considered impaired under historical accounting guidance as its fair value, assessed from an ownership perspective (and not from that of a lessee), exceeded its carrying value. However, in accordance with and upon transitioning to ASU 2016-02, the Company derecognized the remaining asset and liability balances previously recognized solely as a result of the arrangement's build-to-suit designation, as the related construction activities that originally gave rise to such designation have since ended, and established initial ROU asset and lease liability balances measured based on the Company's remaining fixed payment obligations under the lease. The initial ROU asset was then assessed for impairment based on the aggregate estimated cash flows that could be generated by transferring the lease to a market participant sublessee for the remainder of its term, which were lower than the aggregate remaining lease payments underlying the measurement of the initial ROU asset. Accordingly, the Company impaired the initial ROU asset by

$

175.4

million

to its estimated fair value which was recorded as a reduction to its opening retained earnings balance, net of related income tax benefits of

$

43.8

million

, upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, as previously noted.

The Company also recorded other initial ROU asset impairments to reduce its opening retained earnings balance upon adoption of the standard related to leases of certain underperforming retail locations for which the carrying value of the respective store's initial operating lease ROU asset exceeded its fair value. These impairments totaled

$

49.7

million

and were recorded as adjustments to reduce the Company's opening retained earnings balance by

$

37.8

million

, net of related income tax effects. Leasehold improvements related to these underperforming retail locations were previously fully-impaired prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02.

Restructuring and Other Charges

A description of significant restructuring and other activities and their related costs is included below.

Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan

On June 4, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with the Company's strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive sustainable growth (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan includes the following restructuring-related activities: (i) rightsizing and consolidation of the Company's global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of its stores and shop-within-shops.

Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.

A summary of the charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan during the fiscal periods presented, as well as the cumulative charges recorded since its inception, is as follows:

(a)

Inventory-related charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.

(b)

Accelerated stock-based compensation expense, which is recorded within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations, was recorded in connection with vesting provisions associated with certain separation agreements.

(c)

Loss on sale of property, which was recorded within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2019, was incurred in connection with the sale of one of the Company's distribution centers in North America. Total cash proceeds from the sale were

Note 4

).

Way Forward Plan

On June 2, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable sales growth and long-term value creation for shareholders (the "Way Forward Plan"). In connection with the Way Forward Plan, the Company refocused on its core brands and its product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase desirability and relevance. It also evolved its operating model by significantly improving quality of sales, reducing supply chain lead times, improving its sourcing, and executing a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion strategy. The Company reduced its cost structure and implemented a return on investment-driven financial model to free up resources to invest in the brand and drive high-quality sales. The Company also strengthened its leadership team and created a more nimble organization by moving from an average of nine to six layers of management. The Way Forward Plan also included the discontinuance of the Company's Denim & Supply brand and the integration of its denim product offerings into its Polo Ralph Lauren brand. Collectively, these actions, which were substantially completed during the Company's fiscal year ended April 1, 2017 ("Fiscal 2017"), resulted in a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and shop-within-shops.

On March 30, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the following additional restructuring-related activities associated with the Way Forward Plan: (i) the restructuring of its in-house global digital commerce platform which was in development and shifting to a more cost-effective, flexible platform through a new agreement with Salesforce's Commerce Cloud, formerly known as Demandware; (ii) the closure of its Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City; and (iii) the further streamlining of the organization and the execution of other key corporate actions. These additional restructuring-related activities were largely completed during Fiscal 2018 and resulted in a further reduction in workforce and the closure of certain corporate office and store locations.

). As of March 28, 2020, there was no remaining restructuring reserve associated with this plan, and no charges were recorded for this plan in any of the fiscal years presented.

Other Charges

During Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded other charges of

$

20.8

million

related to the donation of net cash proceeds received from the sale of its corporate jet. This donation was made to the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation (formerly known as the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation), a non-profit, charitable foundation that supports various philanthropic programs. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded other charges of

$

8.8

million

primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired.

During Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded other charges of

$

14.1

million

related to depreciation expense associated with the Company's former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, recorded after the store closed during the first quarter of Fiscal 2018. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded other charges of

$

4.2

million

primarily related to a customs audit, as well as

$

18.2

million

primarily related to the launch of its new sabbatical leave program, which entitles eligible employees to periodic paid leave based on the attainment of certain employment tenure milestones. Other than this initial charge to establish its estimated liability for services rendered to-date, the Company does not expect there will be a significant, ongoing impact to the consolidated financial statements in future periods related to its sabbatical leave program.

During Fiscal 2018, the Company recorded other charges of

$

14.1

Income Taxes

Swiss Tax Reform

In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"), which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period.

During the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Swiss Tax Act was enacted into law, resulting in an immaterial adjustment associated with the revaluation of the Company's Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and estimated annual effective tax rate.

Subsequently, as a result of additional information received from the tax authorities and analyses performed related to the transitional provision noted above, the Company recorded a one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of

$

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"), which became effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from


%

to


%

, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.

ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," requires the effects of changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. However, due to the complexity and significance of the TCJA's provisions, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") on December 22, 2017, which allowed companies to record the tax effects of the TCJA on a provisional basis based on a reasonable estimate, and then, if necessary, subsequently adjust such amounts during a limited measurement period as additional information became available and further analyses were completed. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, not to extend beyond one year from enactment.

During the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company recorded charges of

$

231.3

million

within its income tax provision in connection with the TCJA, of which

$

215.5

million

related to the mandatory transition tax, and

$

15.8

million

related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities. Subsequently, as a result of finalizing its full Fiscal 2018 operating results, the issuance of new interpretive guidance, and other analyses performed, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, whereby it reversed

$

6.2

million

of the charges related to the mandatory transition tax and

$

5.5

million

related to the revaluation of its deferred taxes. These reversals were partially offset by an incremental charge of

$

1.8

million

related to the expected future remittance of certain previously deferred foreign earnings. Collectively, these net charges of

$

221.4

million

, which were recorded on a provisional basis, increased the Company's effective tax rate by

4,520 basis points

during Fiscal 2018.

During the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional measurement period adjustment as a result of the issuance of new interpretive guidance related to stock-based compensation for certain executives, whereby it recorded an income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of

$

4.7

million

. Subsequently, during the third quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company completed its analyses and recorded its final measurement period adjustments, whereby it recorded incremental charges of

$

32.3

million

within its income tax provision, substantially all of which related to the mandatory transition tax. These measurement period adjustments increased the Company's effective tax rate by

470 basis points

during Fiscal 2019. Approximately

$


million

of the cumulative TCJA enactment-related charges recorded related to the mandatory transition tax (see

Note 15

).

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017, and therefore the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. See "

Deferred Taxes

" for additional discussion.

The Company also decided to account for the minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") in the period in which it is incurred and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2019.

Tax Rate Reconciliation

The differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and income taxes provided are as set forth below:

(a)

The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate was

21.0

%

during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019. The previous statutory rate of

35.0

%

was reduced to

21.0

%

by the TCJA effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended statutory rate of

31.5

%

for the Company's Fiscal 2018.

(b)

Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax benefit (provision) by income (loss) before income taxes.

The Company's Fiscal 2020 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of


%

primarily due to the one-time income tax benefit recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, as previously discussed, the favorable impact of the change in geographic mix of its worldwide earnings and the favorable impact of tax benefits associated with provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits. The Company's Fiscal 2019 effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of


%

F-29

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

primarily due to the SAB 118 measurement period adjustments recorded, as previously discussed, state and local income taxes, and compensation-related adjustments, partially offset by the favorable impact of the proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed jurisdictions. The Company's Fiscal 2018 effective tax rate was higher than the blended statutory rate of

31.5

%

primarily due to the enactment-related charges recorded in connection with the TCJA, as previously discussed, the negative impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"), and the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits, partially offset by the favorable impact of the proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S. and tax benefits associated with adjustments recorded on deferred tax assets and provision to tax return adjustments.

Deferred Taxes

Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

(a)

Net deferred tax balances as of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

were comprised of non-current deferred tax assets of

$

245.2

million

and

$

67.0

million

, respectively, recorded within deferred tax assets, and non-current deferred tax liabilities of

$

10.0

million

and

$

50.2

million

, respectively, recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of

$

0.7

million

and

$

5.9

million

(both net of tax), respectively, for tax purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal


.

The Company also has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of

$

7.8

million

and

$

28.1

million

(both net of tax), respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against these carryforwards since the Company does not believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such recognition. The valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryforwards increased by

$

0.6

million

(net of tax) as a result of net operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company does not believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards in the future. The valuation allowance relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards decreased by

$

1.1

million

as a result of reductions in net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

As a result of the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, the Company reevaluated its permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on approximately

$


million

of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. These earnings could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were lent to RLC, a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of RLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.

Future Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not limited to, settlements of ongoing tax audits and assessments and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will change significantly during the next twelve months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes, and timing of such events could cause the Company's current estimate to change materially in the future.

The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is generally no longer subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for years prior to its fiscal year ended March 30, 2013.

Senior Notes

In August 2015, the Company completed a registered public debt offering and issued

$


million

aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due

August 18, 2020

, which bear interest at a fixed rate of

2.625

%

, payable semi-annually (the "2.625% Senior Notes"). The 2.625% Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to

99.795

%

of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes.

In August 2018, the Company completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional

$


million

aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due

September 15, 2025

, which bear interest at a fixed rate of

3.750

%

, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). The 3.750% Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to

99.521

%

of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Company's previously outstanding

$


million

principal amount of unsecured

2.125

%

senior notes that matured

September 26, 2018

(the "2.125% Senior Notes").

The Company has the option to redeem the 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes"), in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date plus the greater of (i)


%

of the principal amount of the series of Senior Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present value of Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined in the supplemental indentures governing such Senior Notes (together with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the "Indenture").

The Indenture contains certain covenants that restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease,

F-32

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

or convey all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.

Commercial Paper

The Company has a commercial paper borrowing program that allows it to issue up to

$


million

of unsecured commercial paper notes through private placement using third-party broker-dealers (the "Commercial Paper Program").

Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility, as defined below. Accordingly, the Company does not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Global Credit Facility to exceed

$


million

. Commercial Paper Program borrowings may be used to support the Company's general working capital and corporate needs. Maturities of commercial paper notes vary, but cannot exceed


days from the date of issuance. Commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally with the Company's other forms of unsecured indebtedness. As of

March 28, 2020

, there were

no

borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.

Revolving Credit Facilities

Global Credit Facility

In August 2019, the Company replaced its existing credit facility and entered into a new credit facility that provides for a

$


million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit through

August 12, 2024

(the "Global Credit Facility") under terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the previous facility. The Global Credit Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen, and are guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic significant subsidiaries. In accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Global Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to

$


billion

, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.

In March 2020, the Company borrowed

$

475.0

million

under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This borrowing has been classified as short-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of

March 28, 2020

. The Company was also contingently liable for

$

9.0

million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in remaining availability under the Global Credit Facility of

$

16.0

million

as of

March 28, 2020

.

Under the Global Credit Facility as originally implemented, U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings under the Global Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, either at (a) a base rate, by reference to the greatest of: (i) the annual prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time, (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal funds rate plus

50 basis points

, or (iii) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus

100 basis points

; or (b) LIBOR, adjusted for the Federal Reserve Board's Eurocurrency liabilities maximum reserve percentage, plus a spread of

75 basis points

, subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings ("Adjusted LIBOR"). Foreign currency-denominated borrowings bear interest at Adjusted LIBOR.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Global Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Global Credit Facility relating to the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of

6.5

basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings. These provisions were amended in May 2020, as discussed below.

The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain investments. As originally implemented, the Global Credit Facility also required the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the "leverage ratio") of no greater than 4.25 as of the date of measurement for the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, plus all operating lease obligations. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) operating lease cost, (v) restructuring and other non-recurring expenses, and (vi) acquisition-related

F-33

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

costs.

This requirement was amended in May 2020, as discussed below. As of

March 28, 2020

,

no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company's Global Credit Facility

.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Global Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal, interest, and fee payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Company's common stock.

In May 2020, the Company entered into an amendment of its Global Credit Facility (the "Amendment"). Under the Amendment, until the earlier of (a) the date on which the Company provides the periodic reporting information required under the Global Credit Facility for the quarter ending

September 30, 2021

and (b) the date on which the Company certifies that its leverage ratio as of the last day of the two most recent fiscal quarters was no greater than 4.25 (the "Ratings-Based Toggle Date"), for loans based on Adjusted LIBOR, the spread over Adjusted LIBOR will be increased to

187.5 basis points

, the spread on loans based on the base rate will be 87.5 basis points and the commitment fee will be increased to

25 basis points

, in each case with no adjustments based on the Company's credit rating. The pricing will return to the original levels set forth in the Global Credit Facility on the Ratings-Based Toggle Date. Additionally, the leverage ratio requirements have been waived until the quarter ending

September 30, 2021

. For that Fiscal Quarter the maximum permitted leverage ratio would be

5.25

to

1.00

. For the fiscal quarter ending

December 31, 2021

and the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022 the maximum would be

4.75

to

1.00

. For each fiscal quarter ending on or after

June 30, 2022

, the leverage ratio test would return to

4.25

to

1.00

. The Amendment also (a) imposes a new requirement that would remain in effect until the Ratings-Based Toggle Date that the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash of the Company and its subsidiaries plus the undrawn amounts available under the Global Credit Facility may not be less than

$


million

, (b) restricts the amount of dividends and distributions on, or purchases, redemptions, retirements or acquisitions of, the Company's stock until the Specified Period Termination Date (as defined below), (c) until March 31, 2021, amends the material adverse change representation to disregard pandemic-related impacts to the business and (d) until the Specified Period Termination Date, adds certain other restrictions on indebtedness incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries and investments and acquisitions by the Company and its subsidiaries. The "Specified Period Termination Date" is the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company provides the periodic reporting information required under the Global Credit Facility for the quarter ending

June 30, 2022

and (ii) the date on which the Company certifies that its leverage ratio as of the last day of the two most recent fiscal quarters was no greater than 4.25.

364 Day Facility

In May 2020, the Company entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility (the "364 Day Facility"). The 364 Day Facility provides for a

$


million

senior unsecured revolving line of credit and matures on

May 25, 2021

; provided that the maturity date may be earlier if the Company issues senior notes other than to refinance the currently outstanding senior notes due in August 2020. The terms of the 364 Day Facility are otherwise substantially similar to the terms of the Global Credit Facility as in effect until the Specified Period Termination Date, including with respect to having the same borrowers and guarantors, including with respect to having the same borrowers and guarantors, except that (a) no letters of credit may be issued under the 364 Day Facility, (b) the interest rate under the 364 Day Facility is

187.5 basis points

above Adjusted LIBOR or

87.5 basis points

above the alternate base rate, and the commitment fee is

25 basis points

per annum, in each case subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit rating, (c) the 364 Day Facility contains provisions that limit borrowings if consolidated unrestricted cash and liquid investments of the Company exceed

$


billion

and (d) there is no leverage ratio requirement under the 364 Day Facility. Under the terms of the 364 Day Facility, if the Company does not satisfy certain customary closing conditions by June 15, 2020 (which date will be extended to June 17, 2020 under certain circumstances), the lenders' commitment to make loans will expire.

Pan-Asia Credit Facilities

Certain of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia have uncommitted credit facilities with regional branches of JPMorgan Chase (the "Banks") in China and South Korea (the "Pan-Asia Credit Facilities"). These credit facilities are subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital and corporate needs of the Company's operations in the respective countries. Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the Banks, subject to availability of the Banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities do not contain any financial covenants. The Company's Pan-Asia Credit Facilities by country are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements

U.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy for a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in its valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are market-based (observable) or internally-derived (unobservable). A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:

•

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.

•

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components:

(a)

Based on Level 2 measurements.

(b)

Amount as of

March 28, 2020

was included within short-term investments in the consolidated balance sheet. As of

,

$

54.7

million

was included within cash and cash equivalents and

$

236.0

million

was included within short-term investments in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company's investments in commercial paper are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's investments. To the extent the Company invests in bonds, such investments are also classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets based on quoted prices in active markets.

The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that are primarily based on market observable external inputs, including spot and forward currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and discount rates consistent with the instrument's tenor, and consider the impact of the Company's own credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.

The Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits are recorded at carrying value, which generally approximates fair value based on Level 1 measurements.

F-35

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company's debt instruments are recorded at their carrying values in its consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the Senior Notes are estimated based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices, and with reference to comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates, credit ratings, and trading frequency, among other factors. The fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, are estimated using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's outstanding borrowings. Due to their short-term nature, the fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, generally approximate their carrying values.

The following table summarizes the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments:

(a)

See

Note 11

for discussion of the carrying values of the Company's senior notes.

(b)

Based on Level 2 measurements.

Unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's debt instruments do not result in the realization or expenditure of cash, unless the debt is retired prior to its maturity.

Non-financial Assets and Liabilities

The Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at carrying value in its consolidated balance sheet. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if ultimately considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant assumptions.

During

Fiscal 2020

,

Fiscal 2019

, and

Fiscal 2018

, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, the related inputs of which included estimates of the amount and timing of the assets' net future discounted cash flows (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets), based on historical experience and consideration of current trends, market conditions, and comparable sales, as applicable.

The following tables summarize non-cash impairment charges recorded by the Company during the fiscal years presented in order to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values as of the assessment date:

No

goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. In

Fiscal 2020

, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of the fiscal year. In performing the assessment, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair values and/or carrying amounts of its reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, the results of the Company's then-most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of its qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their respective carrying values, and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.

Subsequent to performing its Fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company determined that indicators of impairment were present during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 as a result of adverse business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of its stores in North America, Europe, and Asia. As a result, the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of goodwill assigned to its reporting units using a quantitative approach as of March 28, 2020. The estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units were determined with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. Based on the results of the quantitative impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the fair values of its reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and were not at risk of impairment. Accordingly, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded.

Financial Instruments

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily relating to certain anticipated cash flows and the value of the reported net assets of its international operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations attributed to changes in a benchmark interest rate. Accordingly, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding derivative instruments recorded on its consolidated balance sheets as of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

:

(a)

FC = Forward foreign currency exchange contracts; IRS = Interest rate swap contracts.

(b)

PP = Prepaid expenses and other current assets; AE = Accrued expenses and other current liabilities; ONCA = Other non-current assets; ONCL = Other non-current liabilities.

(c)

Includes cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the Company's net investment in certain foreign operations.

(d)

Relates to third-party and intercompany foreign currency-denominated exposures and balances.

The Company presents the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting arrangements. However, if the Company were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of all of its derivative instruments on a net basis in accordance with the terms of each of its master netting arrangements, spread across

Risk Management Strategies

Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. dollars. As part of its overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, the Company generally hedges a portion of its related exposures anticipated over the next

twelve months

using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of

two months

to

one year

to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

During Fiscal 2016, the Company entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts which it designated as hedges against changes in the respective fair values of its fixed-rate

2.125

%

Senior Notes and its fixed-rate

2.625

%

Senior Notes, attributed to changes in a benchmark interest rate (the "Interest Rate Swaps"). The interest rate swap related to the

2.125

%

Senior Notes (the "2.125% Interest Rate Swap"), which matured on

September 26, 2018

concurrent with the maturity of the related debt, had a notional amount of

$

2.125

%

Senior Notes for a variable interest rate based on the 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The interest rate swap related to the

2.625

Senior Notes (the "2.625% Interest Rate Swap"), which matures on

August 18, 2020

and also has a notional amount of

$


million

, swaps the fixed interest rate on the

2.625

In connection with the TCJA's provision that subjects previously deferred foreign earnings to a one-time mandatory transition tax, the Company recorded cumulative charges of approximately

$


million

Note 10

). The remaining related income tax payable obligation of

Employee Agreements

The Company has employment agreements with certain executives in the normal course of business which provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances.

Other Commitments

Other off-balance sheet firm commitments amounted to

Other Matters

The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to its business, including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation of its products, taxation, unclaimed property, and employee relations. The Company believes at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's assessment of any current litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that provide general indemnifications. The Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements in the past and does not currently anticipate incurring any material indemnification payments.

Equity

Capital Stock

The Company's capital stock consists of

two

classes of common stock. There are


million

shares of Class A common stock and


million

shares of Class B common stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and Class B common stock have substantially identical rights, except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to

one

vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to

ten

votes per share. Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval, except with respect to the election and removal of directors or as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family, and are convertible at any time into shares of Class A common stock on a

one-for-one

basis.

Class B Common Stock Conversions

During

Fiscal 2020

, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., a limited liability company managed by the children of Mr. Ralph Lauren, converted

1.0

shares of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the security. These conversions occurred in advance of a sales plan providing for the sale of such shares of Class A common stock pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 subject to the conditions set forth therein. These transactions resulted in a reclassification within equity and had no effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

$


million

. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. Accordingly, as a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily suspended its common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity.

Stock-based Compensation

Long-term Stock Incentive Plans

On August 1, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved the 2019 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Incentive Plan"), which replaced the Company's Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 Incentive Plan"). The 2019 Incentive Plan provides for

1.2

million

of new shares authorized for issuance to the participants, in addition to the approximately

3.0

million

shares that remained available for issuance under the 2010 Incentive Plan as of August 1, 2019. In addition, any outstanding awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Company's 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "1997 Incentive Plan") that expire, are forfeited, or are surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes, will become available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan became effective August 1, 2019 and no further grants will be made under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Outstanding awards issued prior to August 1, 2019 will continue to remain subject to the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan or 1997 Incentive Plan, as applicable. As of

March 28, 2020

,

3.8

million

shares remained available for future issuance under the Company's incentive plans.

Stock-based compensation awards that may be made under the 2019 Incentive Plan include, but are not limited to, (i) restricted stock, (ii) RSUs, and (iii) stock options. During the fiscal periods presented, annual grants consisted entirely of restricted stock and RSUs. Additionally, for RSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, vesting continues post-retirement for all or a portion of the remaining unvested RSUs.

Impact on Results

The Company issues its annual grants of stock-based compensation awards in the first half of each fiscal year. Due to the timing of the annual grants and other factors, including the timing and magnitude of forfeiture and performance goal achievement adjustments, as well as changes to the size and composition of the eligible employee population, stock-based compensation expense

recognized during any given fiscal period is not indicative of the level of compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods.

Restricted Stock Awards and Service-based RSUs

Restricted shares granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a

three

-year period, subject to the director's continued service to the Company. The fair values of restricted stock awards are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. Holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the Company's Class A common stock. Effective beginning Fiscal 2019, non-employee directors are now granted service-based RSUs in lieu of restricted shares.

Service-based RSUs granted to certain of the Company's senior executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors, generally vest over a

three

-year period, subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed). The fair values of service-based RSUs are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested.

Performance-based RSUs

The Company grants performance-based RSUs to its senior executives and other key employees. The fair values of performance-based RSUs are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Performance-based RSUs generally vest (i) upon the completion of a

three

-year period of time (cliff vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the Company's achievement of certain performance goals established at the beginning of the

three

-year performance period or (ii) ratably, over a

three

-year period of time (graded vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment during the applicable vesting period (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the achievement by the Company of certain performance goals in the initial year of the

three

-year vesting period.

For performance-based RSUs subject to cliff vesting, beginning with grants in Fiscal 2019, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between


%

(if the specified threshold performance level is not attained) and


%

(if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards originally granted. For such awards granted in recent years prior to Fiscal 2019, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between


%

(if the specified threshold performance level is not attained) and


%

(if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards originally granted. If actual performance exceeds the pre-established threshold, the number of shares earned is calculated based on the relative performance between specified levels of achievement.

Fiscal 2020

is as follows:

Additional information pertaining to performance-based RSU activity is as follows:

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Market-based RSUs

During Fiscal 2019, the Company began granting cliff vesting RSU awards to its senior executives and other key employees, which, in addition to being subject to continuing employment requirements (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed), are also subject to a market condition based on TSR performance. The number of shares that vest upon the completion of a

three

-year period of time is determined by comparing the Company's TSR relative to that of a pre-established peer group over the related

three

-year performance period. Depending on the Company's level of achievement, the number of shares that ultimately vest may range from


%

to


%

of the awards originally granted.

The Company estimates the fair value of its TSR awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of the Company's Class A common stock and that of its peer group to evaluate and determine its ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied.

The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of TSR awards granted during

Fiscal 2020

and

Fiscal 2019

were as follows:

Stock Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. Generally, options become exercisable ratably (graded-vesting schedule) over a

three

-year vesting period, subject to the employee's continuing employment. Stock options generally expire

seven years

from the date of grant. No stock options were granted during any of the fiscal years presented.

A summary of stock option activity during

Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company sponsors defined contribution benefit plans covering substantially all eligible employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company makes matching contributions to the plans equal to


%

of the first


%

of salary contributed by an eligible employee. Additionally, the Company makes a supplemental matching contribution for plan years in which the Company achieves an "above target" performance level based on certain goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year, increasing the matching contribution to between


%

and


%

depending on the performance level achieved, of the first


%

of salary contributed by eligible employees, not to exceed the maximum contribution permitted by the plan.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant becomes

100%

vested in the Company's matching contributions after

five years

of credited service. Contributions made by the Company under these plans were

$

8.7

million

,

$

11.2

million

, and

$

10.6

million

in

Fiscal 2020

,

Fiscal 2019

, and

Fiscal 2018

, respectively.

International Defined Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit plans and cash balance plans at international locations which are not considered to be material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's financial statements. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation levels during their employment period. The aggregate funded status of the single-employer defined benefit plans reflected net liabilities of

$

4.0

million

and

$

2.8

million

as of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

, respectively, and were primarily recorded within other non-current liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. These single-employer defined benefit plans had aggregate projected benefit obligations of

$

52.4

million

and aggregate fair values of plan assets of

$

48.4

million

as of

March 28, 2020

, compared to aggregate projected benefit obligations of

$

48.1

million

and aggregate fair values of plan assets of

$

45.3

million

as of

March 30, 2019

. The asset portfolio of the single-employer defined benefit plans primarily consists of fixed income securities, which have been measured at fair value largely using Level 2 inputs, as described in

Note 12

. Net pension expense for these plans was

$

5.0

million

,

$

4.2

million

, and

$

6.6

million

in

Fiscal 2020

,

Fiscal 2019

, and

Fiscal 2018

, respectively. The service cost component of

$

4.7

million

,

$

4.4

million

, and

$

4.6

million

in

Fiscal 2020

,

Fiscal 2019

, and

Fiscal 2018

, respectively, was recorded within SG&A expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. All other components of net pension expense during the fiscal years presented were recorded within other income (expense), net, in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.

Union Pension Plan

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is required to make contributions to the Workers United union (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) (the "Union") for dues based on wages paid to union employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to a retirement fund which provides defined benefits to substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not participate in the management of the plan and has not been furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits provided, vested and non-vested benefits, or assets.

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. Such liability was assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee. The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the plan.

Other Compensation Plans

The Company had a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the 401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans were expected to be constrained by the operation of Internal Revenue Code limitations. These supplemental benefits vested over time and the related compensation expense was recognized over the vesting period. Effective August 2008, the Company amended this plan, resulting in a suspension of the annual contributions for substantially all plan participants. Further, affected participants were provided with a one-time election to either withdraw all benefits vested in the plan in a lump sum amount or remain in the plan and receive future distributions of benefits. As of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

, amounts accrued under this plan totaled

$

3.4

million

and

$

5.1

million

, respectively, and were classified within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense recognized related to these benefits was not material in any of the fiscal years presented.

Segment Information

The Company has

three

reportable segments based on its business activities and organization:

•

North America

— The North America segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club Monaco. In North America, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, and its digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. The Company's wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores.

•

Europe

— The Europe segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, excluding Club Monaco. In Europe, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business in Europe is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.

•

Asia

— The Asia segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company's retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018. In addition, the Company sells its products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. In Asia, the Company's wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.

No operating segments were aggregated to form the Company's reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made through its retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and its licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues earned through its global licensing alliances, excluding Club Monaco.

The Company's segment reporting structure is consistent with how it establishes its overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses performance of its business. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3. Sales and transfers between segments are generally recorded at cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating segment performance. Each segment's performance is evaluated based upon net revenues and operating income before restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other one-time items, if any. Certain corporate overhead expenses related to global functions, most notably the Company's executive office, information technology, finance and accounting, human resources, and legal departments, largely remain at corporate. Additionally, other costs that cannot be allocated to the segments based on specific usage are also maintained at corporate, including corporate advertising and marketing expenses, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, and other general and administrative expenses resulting from corporate-level activities and projects. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.

Effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, operating results related to the Company's business in Latin America are included within its Europe segment due to a change in how the Company manages this business. Previously, such results were included within the Company's other non-reportable segments. All prior period segment information has been recast to reflect this change on a comparative basis.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ralph Lauren Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Ralph Lauren Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of

March 28, 2020

, based on criteria established in Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ralph Lauren Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

March 28, 2020

, based on the COSO criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

March 28, 2020

and

March 30, 2019

, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

March 28, 2020

, and the related notes and our report dated

May 27, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
