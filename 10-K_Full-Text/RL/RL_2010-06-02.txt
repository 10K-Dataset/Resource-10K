PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, founded in 1967 by Ralph Lauren,
    is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of
    premium lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s
    and children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. We believe that our global reach, breadth of
    product and multi-channel distribution is unique among luxury
    and apparel companies. We operate in three distinct but
    integrated segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.

The tables below show our net revenues and operating profit
    (excluding unallocated corporate expenses and legal and
    restructuring charges) by segment for the last two fiscal years.
    In connection with the closing of the Asia-Pacific Licensed
    Operations Acquisition (as defined and discussed under

“Recent Developments”

) at the beginning of the
    fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, we restated our segment
    presentation to reclassify concessions-based sales arrangements
    to our Retail segment from our Wholesale segment. Segment
    information for Fiscal 2009 has been recast to conform to the
    current period’s presentation. See Note 2 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of the restatement of our segment
    presentation.

    impairment charges of $6.6 million related to the
    write-down of certain long-lived assets, primarily in the Retail
    segment. Fiscal 2009 included asset impairment charges of
    $55.4 million, of which $52.0 million related to the
    write-down of certain Retail store assets, and $2.8 million
    in the Wholesale segment and $0.6 million in the Corporate
    office related to the write-down of certain capitalized software
    costs (see Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements).

(b)

Fiscal years presented included
    certain unallocated restructuring charges and legal-related
    activity. Restructuring charges, net for Fiscal 2010 consisted
    of $6.9 million, of which $5.4 million related to the
    Wholesale segment, $2.0 million related to the Retail
    segment and $0.5 million represented the reversal of an
    excess reserve related to Corporate operations. Restructuring
    charges for Fiscal 2009 consisted of $23.6 million, of
    which $12.7 million related to the Retail segment,
    $7.3 million related to the Wholesale segment and
    $3.6 million related to Corporate operations (see
    Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements). Legal-related activity for Fiscal 2010 consisted of
    legal charges of $4.8 million primarily related to the
    settlement of the Company’s California Labor Litigation
    matter, offset in part by the reversal of an excess legal
    reserve of $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
    Legal-related activity for Fiscal 2009 consisted of the reversal
    of an excess legal reserve in the amount of $0.5 million.

Our net revenues by geographic region for the last two fiscal
    years are shown in the table below. Note 22 to our

Over the past five fiscal years, our sales have grown to
    $4.979 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $3.746 billion in
    Fiscal 2006. This growth has been largely a result of both our
    acquisitions and organic growth. We have diversified our
    business by channels of distribution, price point and target
    consumer, as well as by geography. Our global reach is one of
    the broadest in the apparel industry, with Ralph Lauren-branded
    merchandise available at approximately 9,000 different retail
    locations worldwide. In addition to our wholesale distribution,
    we sell directly to customers throughout the world via 350
    full-price and factory retail stores, 281 concessions-based
    shop-within-shops and our

e-commerce

websites, RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com.

We continue to invest in our business. In the past five fiscal
    years, we have invested approximately $1.769 billion for
    acquisitions and capital improvements, primarily through strong
    operating cash flow. We intend to continue to execute our
    long-term strategy of expanding our presence internationally,
    extending our

direct-to-consumer

reach, expanding our accessories and other product offerings,
    and investing in our operational infrastructure. See
    Item 7 —

“Overview

—

Our
    Objectives and Risks”

for further discussion of the
    Company’s long-term strategy.

We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding
    of our Company. As of April 3, 2010, Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    or entities controlled by the Lauren family, owned approximately
    84% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the
    Company.

Seasonality
    of Business

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with
    higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth
    quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third
    quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing



of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel,

back-to-school

and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment. As a result
    of the growth and other changes in our business, along with
    changes in consumer spending patterns and the macroeconomic
    environment, historical quarterly operating trends and working
    capital requirements may not be indicative of future
    performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating
    income and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by,
    among other things, the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments
    and other events affecting retail sales.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working
    capital typically increases during the first half of the fiscal
    year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling
    periods and, accordingly, typically decreases during the second
    half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash
    provided by operating activities is typically higher in the
    second half of the fiscal year due to higher net income and
    reduced working capital requirements during that period.

Recent
    Developments

Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition

On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel business in Asia-Pacific (excluding
    Japan) from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets from Dickson Concepts International
    Limited and affiliates (“Dickson”) in exchange for an
    initial payment of approximately $20 million and other
    consideration of approximately $17 million (the
    “Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition”).
    Dickson was the Company’s licensee for Polo-branded apparel
    in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), which is comprised
    of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
    Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. The Company funded the
    Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash
    on-hand.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded apparel business
    in Asia-Pacific have been consolidated in the Company’s
    results of operations commencing January 1, 2010.

    and urban. Polo Jeans Co. is available exclusively in Asia and

    sexy vibe for an individualistic approach to personal style.

one-of-a-kind

edge. The Rugby collections are available at Rugby stores

    craftsmanship and iconic beauty. Ralph Lauren accessories for
    women capture a wide array of timeless styles, from a glamorous
    handmade alligator Ricky Bag that takes up to 12 hours to
    craft to weathered canvas saddle bags with authentic equestrian
    hardware to vintage luggage — inspired handbags that
    recall the golden age of travel. Ralph Lauren’s signature
    motifs can be found throughout — from jockey-print
    scarves, riding boots with equestrian hardware and vintage
    aviator sunglasses to striking diamante evening shoes, romantic
    ruffled scarves and antique,

one-of-a-kind

belts and jewelry. Ralph Lauren accessories and dress
    furnishings are a man’s most refined finishing touch.

boots. Handcrafted luggage and leathergoods combine handsome

    collections — from vintage-inspired eyewear and Savile
    Row-inspired haberdashery to sleek silver engraved cuff links
    and engine-turned belt buckles to luxe cashmere scarves and

    men. Since then, Ralph Lauren Fragrance has captured the essence
    of Ralph Lauren’s men’s and women’s brands, from

Our
    Wholesale Segment

Our Wholesale segment sells our products to leading upscale and
    certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores and golf
    and pro shops, both domestically and internationally. We have
    continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store
    product assortment and presentation, and improving full-price
    sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2010, our
    Ralph Lauren-branded products were sold through approximately
    9,000 doors worldwide and during Fiscal 2010, we invested
    approximately $29 million in related shop-within-shops
    primarily in domestic and international department and specialty
    stores.

Department stores are our major wholesale customers in North
    America. In Europe, our wholesale sales are a varying mix of
    sales to both department stores and specialty shops, depending
    on the country. Our collection brands — Women’s
    Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label and Men’s Purple
    Label Collection and Black Label — are distributed
    through a limited number of premier fashion retailers. In
    addition, we sell excess and

out-of-season

products through secondary distribution channels, including our
    retail factory stores. In Japan, our wholesale products are
    distributed primarily through shop-within-shops at premiere and
    top tier department stores, and the mix of business is weighted
    to Women’s Blue and Black Label. In this region, products
    distributed through concessions-based sales arrangements are
    reported within our Retail segment (see

“Our Retail
    Segment”

for further discussion).



Worldwide
    Distribution Channels

The following table presents the number of doors by geographic
    location, in which Ralph Lauren-branded products distributed by
    our Wholesale segment were sold to consumers in our primary
    channels of distribution as of April 3, 2010:

In Asia-Pacific, our products are

    arrangements.

In addition, American Living and Chaps-branded products
    distributed by our Wholesale segment were sold domestically
    through approximately 1,700 doors as of April 3, 2010.

We have five key department-store customers that generate
    significant sales volume. For Fiscal 2010, these customers in
    the aggregate accounted for approximately 45% of all wholesale
    revenues, with Macy’s, Inc. representing approximately 18%
    of these revenues.

Our product brands are sold primarily through their own sales
    forces. Our Wholesale segment maintains its primary showrooms in
    New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in
    Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, Paris, London, Munich, Madrid
    and Stockholm.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical
    element of our distribution to department stores, we and our
    licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand
    recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines
    by the department stores and to differentiate the presentation
    of products. Shop-within-shops fixed assets primarily include
    items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and
    components, decorative items and flooring.

As of April 3, 2010, we had approximately 14,000
    shop-within-shops dedicated to our Ralph Lauren-branded
    wholesale products worldwide. Excluding significantly larger
    shop-within-shops in key department store locations, the size of
    our shop-within-shops typically ranges from approximately 300 to
    6,000 square feet. We normally share in the cost of these
    shop-within-shops with our wholesale customers.

Basic Stock Replenishment
    Program.

Basic products such as knit shirts,
    chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered at any time
    through our basic stock replenishment programs. We generally
    ship these products within

three-to-five

days of order receipt.

Our
    Retail Segment

As of April 3, 2010, our Retail segment consisted of 179
    full-price retail stores and 171 factory stores worldwide,
    totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet, 281
    concessions-based shop-within-shops and two

e-commerce

websites. The extension of our

direct-to-consumer

reach is a primary long-term strategic goal.

Full-Price
    Retail Stores

Our full-price retail stores reinforce the luxury image and
    distinct sensibility of our brands and feature exclusive lines
    that are not sold in domestic department stores. We opened 3 new
    full-price stores and closed 3 full-price stores in Fiscal 2010.
    In addition, we assumed 16 full-price stores in connection with
    the Asia-Pacific



Licensed Operations Acquisition (see

“Recent
    Developments”

for further discussion). We operated the
    following full-price retail stores as of April 3, 2010:

    over 33,000 square feet. These full-price stores are
    situated in major upscale street locations and upscale regional

    renewal options.

    and 9 provinces in Japan, principally in major outlet centers.

Factory stores obtain products from our suppliers, our product
    licensing partners and our retail stores.

Concessions-based
    Shop-within-Shops

In Asia (including Japan), the terms of trade for
    shop-within-shops are largely conducted on a concessions basis,
    whereby inventory continues to be owned by the Company (not the
    department store) until ultimate sale to the end consumer and
    the salespeople involved in the sales transaction are employees
    of the Company. Effective with the closing of the Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition, all concessions-based sales
    arrangements have been classified within our Retail segment, in
    contrast to the historical classification within our Wholesale
    segment. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

As of April 3, 2010, we had 281 concessions-based
    shop-within-shops at approximately 170 retail locations
    dedicated to our Ralph Lauren-branded products, primarily in
    Asia (including Japan). The size of our concessions-based
    shop-within-shops typically ranges from approximately 150 to
    4,500 square feet. We share in the cost of these
    shop-within-shops with our department store partners.

In addition to our stores, our Retail segment sells products
    online through our

e-commerce

    approximately 390,000 new customers, resulting in over
    2 million total customers in Fiscal 2010.

    with style tips, unique videos and blog-based content. Rugby.com

    customers in Fiscal 2010.

Our
    Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight,
    design, and marketing skills with the specific product or
    geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and
    build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners
    who:

•

are leaders in their respective markets;

•

contribute the majority of the product development costs;

•

provide the operational infrastructure required to support the
    business; and

•

own the inventory.

We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell
    at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more
    of our trademarks. We grant our international geographic area
    licensing partners exclusive rights to distribute certain brands
    or classes of our products and operate retail stores in specific
    international territories. These geographic area licensees
    source products from us, our product licensing partners and
    independent sources. Each licensing partner pays us royalties
    based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a
    minimum royalty requirement for the right to use the
    Company’s trademarks and design services. In addition,
    licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of
    their revenues to advertise our products and share in the
    creative costs associated



with these products. Larger allocations are required in
    connection with launches of new products or in new territories.
    Our licenses generally have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that their
    products are developed, marketed and distributed so as to reach
    the intended market opportunity and to present consistently to
    consumers worldwide the distinctive perspective and lifestyle
    associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design,
    production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution,
    advertising and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject
    to our prior approval and continuing oversight. The result is a
    consistent identity for Ralph Lauren products across product
    categories and international markets.

Approximately 30% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2010 was
    derived from three licensing partners: Luxottica Group, S.p.A.
    (12%), The Warnaco Group, Inc. (9%) and Peerless, Inc. (9%).

We believe that international markets offer additional
    opportunities for our quintessential American designs and
    lifestyle image. We work with our international licensing
    partners to facilitate international growth in their respective
    territories. International expansion/growth opportunities may
    include:

•

the roll out of new products and brands following their launch
    in the U.S.;

•

the introduction of additional product lines;

•

the entrance into new international markets;

•

the addition of Ralph Lauren or Polo Ralph Lauren stores in
    these markets; and

•

the expansion and upgrade of shop-within-shop networks in these
    markets.

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell,
    promote, market

and/or

distribute various categories of our products in a given
    geographic area. These rights may include the right to own and
    operate retail stores. The economic arrangements are similar to
    those of our product licensing partners. We design licensed
    products either alone or in collaboration with our domestic
    licensing partners. Our product licensees, whose territories do
    not include the international geographic area licensees’
    territories, generally provide our international licensing
    partners with product or patterns, piece goods, manufacturing
    locations and other information and assistance necessary to
    achieve product uniformity, for which they are often compensated
    by these partners.

As of April 3, 2010, our international licensing partners
    operated 63 Ralph Lauren stores and 60 Club Monaco stores and
    dedicated shops.

Ralph
    Lauren Home

Together with our licensing partners, we offer an extensive
    collection of home products that draw upon and further the
    design themes of our other product lines, contributing to our
    complete lifestyle concept. Products are sold under the

Ralph

,

Lauren Ralph Lauren

,

Chaps

and

American Living

brands in three primary categories:
    bedding and bath, home décor and home improvement. As of
    April 3, 2010, we had agreements with 11 domestic and
    2 international home product licensing partners and one
    international home product sublicensing partner.

We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home
    licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners.
    These services include design, operating showrooms, marketing,
    advertising and, in some cases, sales. In general, the licensing
    partners manufacture and own the inventory, and ship the
    products. Our Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances generally
    have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the upper tiers of
    their respective markets and are offered at a range of price
    levels. These products are generally distributed through several
    channels of distribution, including department stores, specialty
    home furnishings stores, interior design showrooms, customer
    direct mail catalogs, home centers and the Internet, as well as
    our own stores. As with our other products, the use of
    shop-within-shops is central to our department store
    distribution strategy.

    consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an
    important contributor to the prominence, strength and reputation
    of the Ralph Lauren brands.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the
    direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which
    is divided into nine departments: Menswear, Women’s
    Collection, Women’s Ready to Wear, Dresses,
    Children’s, Accessories, Home, Club Monaco and Rugby. We
    form design teams around our brands and product categories to
    develop concepts, themes and products for each brand and
    category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales
    and production staff, these teams support all three segments of
    our business — Wholesale, Retail and
    Licensing — in order to gain market and other valuable
    input.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing program communicates the themes and images of our
    brands and is an integral feature of our product offering.
    Worldwide marketing is managed on a centralized basis through
    our advertising and public relations departments in order to
    ensure consistency of presentation.

We create distinctive image advertising for all of our brands,
    conveying the particular message of each one within the context
    of the overall Ralph Lauren aesthetic. Advertisements generally
    portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a
    variety of products offered by ourselves and, in some cases, our
    licensing partners. Our primary advertising medium is print,
    with multiple page advertisements appearing regularly in a range
    of fashion, lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major
    print advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and
    spring retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to
    coincide with product deliveries. In addition to print, some
    brands have utilized television and outdoor media in their
    marketing programs. Our RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com

e-commerce

websites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle on the Internet
    while offering the full breadth of our apparel, accessories and
    home products.

We advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate
    in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of
    our retailer partners. In addition, we provide

point-of-sale

fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the
    presentation of our products at retail locations. We expensed
    approximately $157 million related to the advertising of
    our products in Fiscal 2010, a decrease of approximately 8% from
    Fiscal 2009.

When our domestic licensing partners are required to spend an
    amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on
    advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their
    behalf.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each
    of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at
    major fashion shows in New York City, which typically generate
    extensive domestic and international media coverage. We
    introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at
    major fashion shows in cities such as New York or Milan, Italy.
    In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our models,
    certain professional athletes and sponsors. We are the first
    exclusive outfitter for all on-court officials at the Wimbledon
    tennis tournament and are currently the official outfitter of
    all on-court officials at the U.S. Open tennis tournament.

In June 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with the
    United States Olympic Committee to be the exclusive Official
    Parade Outfitter for the 2010 and 2012 U.S. Olympic and
    Paralympic Teams. Under this agreement, the Company designed the
    official opening and closing ceremony Parade Outfits for the
    U.S. Olympic team members of the 2010 Winter Olympics in
    Vancouver, in addition to an assortment of leisure/village wear
    (“Leisure Wear”) pieces provided to the athletes on
    the U.S. Teams. In addition, the Company has the right to
    manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote and sell products in
    the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits and Leisure
    Wear.



Sourcing,
    Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own
    or operate any production facilities. Over 400 different
    manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear and
    accessories products, with no one manufacturer providing more
    than 8% of our total production during Fiscal 2010. We source
    both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include
    fabric, buttons and other trim. Finished products consist of
    manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to
    our customers. In Fiscal 2010, less than 2%, by dollar volume,
    of our products were produced in the U.S., and over 98%, by
    dollar volume, were produced outside the U.S., primarily in
    Asia, Europe and South America. See

“Import Restrictions
    and other Government Regulations”

and
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business — Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.”

Most of the businesses in our Wholesale segment must commit to
    manufacture our garments before we receive customer orders. We
    also must commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance
    of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers’
    demand for a particular product, we may sell the excess in our
    factory stores or sell the product through secondary
    distribution channels. If we overestimate the need for a
    particular fabric or yarn, that fabric or yarn may be used in
    garments made for subsequent seasons or made into past
    seasons’ styles for distribution in our factory stores.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global
    manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia,
    the Americas and Europe. All garments are produced according to
    our specifications. Production and quality control staff in the
    Americas, Asia and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier
    facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the
    final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor
    certification and compliance programs, so that quality assurance
    is focused upon as early as possible in the production process,
    allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution
    facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.

Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and
    consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with
    numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic and foreign.
    Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
    substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on
    the basis of fashion, quality and service, which depend on our
    ability to:

•

anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely
    manner;

•

maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

develop and produce high quality products that appeal to
    consumers;

•

appropriately price our products;

•

provide strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensure product availability; and

•

obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present our
    products at retail.

See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors —
    Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete —
    We face intense competition in the worldwide apparel
    industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution in the U.S., Ralph Lauren products
    are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution
    centers for inspection, sorting, packing, and shipment to retail
    and wholesale customers. This network includes our owned
    distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina, a leased
    facility in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and third party
    logistics centers in Chino Hills, California and Miami, Florida.
    All facilities are



designed to allow for high density cube storage and value added
    services, and utilize carton and unit tracking technology to
    facilitate process control and inventory management. Canadian
    distribution to Club Monaco stores is supported by a third party
    logistics provider in Toronto, Ontario. European distribution is
    serviced by a third party facility located in Parma, Italy.
    Japan logistics are supported by third party facilities in
    Kawasaki and Ebina. Excluding Japan, Asia-Pacific distribution
    is serviced by a third party facility in Hong Kong, supported by
    small satellite third party locations in China, Singapore,
    Malaysia and Taiwan. The network is managed through globally
    integrated information technology systems.

RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com customer contact functions and
    order fulfillment are performed at a leased facility in High
    Point, North Carolina.

Management
    Information Systems

Our management information systems make the marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution of our products more
    efficient by providing, among other things:

•

comprehensive order processing;

•

production information;

•

accounting information; and

•

an enterprise view of information for our marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution functions.

The

point-of-sale

registers in conjunction with other systems in our stores enable
    us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a
    real-time basis. We believe our merchandising and financial
    systems, coupled with our

point-of-sale

registers and software programs, allow for stock replenishment,
    effective merchandise planning and real-time inventory
    accounting. See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business —
    Certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters could adversely
    impact our results of operations.”

We also utilize an automated replenishment system, Logility, to
    facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our
    Retail segment and wholesale customers, the movement of goods
    through distribution channels, and the collection of information
    for planning and forecasting. We have a collaborative
    relationship with many of our suppliers that enables us to
    reduce

cash-to-cash

cycles in the management of our inventory. See
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business

—

Our business could suffer if our computer
    systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate
    effectively.”

Wholesale
    Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise
    primarily to major department stores and extend credit based on
    an evaluation of the customer’s financial capacity and
    condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor
    credit levels and the financial condition of our customers on a
    continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or
    underwrite our accounts receivables, or maintain credit
    insurance to manage the risks of bad debts. Collection and
    deduction transactional activities are principally provided
    through a third party service provider. Our bad debt expenses
    were approximately $5 million in Fiscal 2010, representing
    less than 1 percent of net revenues. See
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors — Risks
    Related to Our Business

—

Our business could be
    negatively impacted by any financial instability of our
    customers.”

Wholesale
    Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products
    approximately three to five months prior to the time the
    products are delivered to stores. Such orders are generally
    subject to broad cancellation rights. As of April 3, 2010,
    our total backlog was $1.160 billion, compared to
    $1.289 billion as of March 28, 2009. We expect that
    substantially all of our backlog orders as of April 3, 2010
    will be filled within the next fiscal year. The size of our
    order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the
    timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which
    a significant percentage of our orders are received, and the
    timing of shipments. As a consequence, a



comparison of the size of our order backlog from period to
    period may not be necessarily meaningful, nor may it be
    indicative of eventual shipments. Nevertheless, the decrease in
    our order backlog from the prior year is associated in part with
    a reduction in customer orders relating to the contraction in
    consumer spending likely to continue during Fiscal 2011.

Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph Lauren,”
    “Polo by Ralph Lauren Design” and the famous polo
    player astride a horse trademarks in the U.S. and
    approximately 100 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we
    similarly own include:

•

“Lauren Ralph Lauren”;

•

“Lauren”;

•

“Purple Label”;

•

“Pink Pony”;

•

“Ralph”;

•

“RRL”;

•

“Club Monaco”;

•

“Rugby”;

•

“RLX”;

•

“Chaps”;

•

“American Living”; and

•

Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.

Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as
    trademarks “Ralph Lauren,” “Double RL” and
    “RRL” in perpetuity in connection with, among other
    things, beef and living animals. The trademarks “Double
    RL” and “RRL” are currently used by the Double RL
    Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. In addition,
    Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects
    involving film or theatrical productions (not including or
    relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a
    company wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these
    companies has no impact on us.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations and pending
    applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items
    of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings,
    restaurant and café services, online services and online
    publications and beauty products, as well as in connection with
    retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage
    and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks
    remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in
    connection with the related products and services and the
    required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license
    to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to
    the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our
    products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect
    them against infringement (see Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion). As
    a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been
    the object of counterfeiting. We have a broad enforcement
    program which has been generally effective in controlling the
    sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major
    markets abroad.

In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our
    trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our
    international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with
    various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in
    certain trademarks, including “Polo”

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, which impede
    our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such
    conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we
    continue our international expansion, we have, in general,
    successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both
    legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners
    of the conflicting



marks (see Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business

—

Our trademarks and other intellectual
    property rights may not be adequately protected outside the
    U.S.”

and Item 3 —

“Legal
    Proceedings”

for further discussion). Although we have
    not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions
    on doing business in desirable markets, we cannot assure that
    significant impediments will not arise in the future as we
    expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.

Import
    Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the U.S., Canada,
    and Europe is subject to duties. Until January 1, 2008,
    much of our apparel merchandise was also subject to safeguard
    quotas. Notwithstanding quota elimination, China’s
    accession agreement for membership in the WTO provided that WTO
    member countries (including the U.S., Canada and European
    countries) could reimpose quotas on specific categories of
    products in the event it is determined that imports from China
    surged and threatened to create a market disruption for such
    categories of products (so called “safeguard quota
    provisions”). Such safeguard quotas were permissible
    through January 1, 2008. From January 1, 2008 through
    January 1, 2011, WTO member countries can reimpose
    merchandise-specific safeguard quota. No such quotas are
    currently in effect. The U.S. and other countries may also
    unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a
    particular product being imported (from China or other
    countries) at unfairly traded prices that in such increased
    quantities as to cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant
    domestic industry (generally known as “anti-dumping”
    actions). The European Union has imposed certain anti-dumping
    duties on imports from China and Vietnam in certain footwear
    categories. Canada currently also has an anti-dumping order on
    waterproof footwear under consideration. If dumping is suspected
    in the U.S., the U.S. Government may self-initiate a
    dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry which
    could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional
    duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be
    imposed by the U.S. Government to offset subsidies provided
    by a foreign government to foreign manufactures if the
    importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens
    to injure a U.S. industry. Recent developments have now
    made it possible to impose countervailing duties on products
    from non-market economies, such as China, which could
    significantly increase our costs.

We are also subject to other international trade agreements and
    regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,
    the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean
    Basin Initiative. In addition, each of the countries in which
    our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports.
    Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our
    products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time,
    impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls
    or restrictions, including the imposition of “safeguard
    quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates
    or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of
    import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our
    potential exposure to import related risks through, among other
    measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts
    of production among countries and manufacturers, as well as
    through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all our products are manufactured by foreign
    suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the
    administration of current international trade regulations,
    executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in
    sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quota could
    adversely affect our operations. Although we generally expect
    that the 2005 elimination of quotas will result, over the long
    term, in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced
    abroad, the implementation of any “safeguard quota
    provisions” or any “anti-dumping” or
    “countervailing duty” actions may result, over the
    near term, in cost increases and in disruption of the supply
    chain for certain products categories. See
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors — Risks
    Related to Our Business — Our business is subject to
    risks associated with importing products”

and

“Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
    Business — Our ability to conduct business in
    international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory,
    political and economic risks.”

Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to
    regulation in the U.S. and other countries by other
    governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade
    Commission, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer
    Products Safety Commission, including the recently enacted
    Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (“CPSIA”)
    which imposes new limitations on the permissible amounts of lead
    and phthalates allowed in children’s products. These
    regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing
    requirements, flammability



testing, and product safety particularly with respect to
    products used by children. We believe that we are in substantial
    compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable
    federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations
    governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the
    environment. We do not estimate any significant capital
    expenditures for environmental control matters either in the
    current fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products
    and licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our
    agreements require our licensing partners to operate in
    compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are not aware
    of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a
    material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Although we have not suffered any material restriction from
    doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot
    assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future
    as we expand product offerings and introduce additional
    trademarks to new markets.

Employees

As of April 3, 2010, we had approximately
    19,000 employees, both full and part-time, consisting of
    approximately 13,000 in the U.S. and approximately 6,000 in
    foreign countries. Approximately 30 of our U.S. production
    and distribution employees in the womenswear business are
    members of UNITE HERE (which was previously known as the Union
    of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, prior to its
    merger with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
    International Union) under an industry association collective
    bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has
    adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and
    non-union employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
    The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking
    statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
    business, our prospects, our operating results, our financial
    condition, the trading prices of our securities and the actual
    outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are
    made in this report. Additional risks that we do not yet know of
    or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our
    business operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The loss
    of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or other key personnel
    could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing
    and operational areas of our business has been a critical
    element of our success since the inception of our Company. The
    death or disability of Mr. Lauren or other extended or
    permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or
    industry perception with respect to him or arising from his
    loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our
    other executive officers and other members of senior management
    have substantial experience and expertise in our business and
    have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
    The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these
    individuals could also have a material adverse effect on us. We
    are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar
    life insurance covering Mr. Lauren, our other executive
    officers and certain other members of senior management. We have
    entered into employment agreements with Mr. Lauren and our
    other executive officers, but the noncompete period with respect
    to Mr. Lauren and certain other executive officers could,
    in some circumstances in the event of their termination of
    employment with the Company, end prior to the employment term
    set forth in their employment agreements.

Our
    business could be negatively impacted by any financial
    instability of our customers.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department
    stores across the U.S., Europe and Asia and extend credit based
    on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral.



However, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us
    to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also
    assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s
    receivables. In the aggregate, our five largest department-store
    customers constituted approximately 30% of our gross trade
    accounts receivable outstanding as of April 3, 2010 and
    contributed approximately 45% of all wholesale revenues for
    Fiscal 2010. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts
    receivable from any one of these customers could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
    liquidity. See Item 1 —

“Business — Wholesale Credit Control.”

The
    economic recession could have a negative impact on our major
    customers and suppliers which in turn could materially adversely
    affect our results of operations and liquidity.

The economic recession is having a significant negative impact
    on businesses around the world. Although we believe that our
    cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity
    under our revolving credit facility will provide us with
    sufficient liquidity through the current recession, the impact
    of this recession on our major customers and suppliers cannot be
    predicted and may be quite severe. The inability of major
    manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to
    meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. A
    disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access
    liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall
    deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a
    significant reduction in their future orders of our products and
    the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment
    obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations and liquidity.

The
    Company has an exclusive relationship with certain customers for
    some of its products. The loss or significant decline in
    business of any of these customers could negatively impact our
    business.

The Company has exclusive relationships with certain customers
    for distribution of some of its products, including its

American Living

and

Chaps

products. Our
    arrangements with JCPenney and Kohl’s for the

American
    Living

and

Chaps

products, respectively, make us
    dependent on the financial and operational health of those
    companies. As a result, a decrease in sales volume, as
    experienced in Fiscal 2010 due to a contraction in consumer
    spending associated with the weakened global economic
    environment, or the loss of the business of these customers, may
    negatively impact the Company’s business.

We cannot
    assure the successful implementation of our growth
    strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands,
    expand our geographic coverage and increase direct management of
    our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically
    acquiring or integrating select businesses previously held by
    our licensees and enhancing our operations. Implementation of
    our strategy involves the continued expansion of our business in
    Europe, Asia and other international areas. As discussed in
    Item 1 —

“Business — Recent
    Developments,”

on December 31, 2009, we acquired
    our previously licensed Polo-branded apparel business in the
    Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan). In Fiscal 2009, we
    acquired our previously licensed childrenswear and golf apparel
    businesses in Japan. In Fiscal 2008, we acquired a controlling
    interest in Impact 21 Co., Ltd. and the remaining 50% interest
    in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation, as well as our
    previously licensed belts and leather goods business.

We may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our
    operations, hiring and retaining qualified key employees, or
    otherwise successfully managing such expansion. Furthermore, we
    may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any
    licensee that we acquire into our own business or achieve any
    expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.

Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation
    and expansion of our retail distribution network, both in the
    U.S. and abroad, which are subject to many factors beyond
    our control. We may not be able to procure, purchase or lease
    desirable free-standing or department store locations, or renew
    and maintain existing free-standing store leases and department
    store locations on acceptable terms, or secure suitable
    replacement locations. The lease negotiation as well as the
    number and timing of new stores actually opened during any given
    period, and their associated contribution to net income for the
    period, depends on a number of factors including, but not
    limited, to: (i) the availability of suitable financing to
    us and our landlords; (ii) the timing of the delivery of
    the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to
    commence build-out construction activities; (iii) our
    ability and



our landlords’ ability to obtain all necessary governmental
    licenses and permits to construct and operate our stores on a
    timely basis; (iv) our ability to manage the construction
    and development costs of new stores; (v) the rectification
    of any unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the
    leased premises; (vi) adverse weather during the
    construction period; and (vii) the hiring and training of
    qualified operating personnel in the local market. While we
    continue to explore new markets and are always evaluating new
    potential locations, any of the above factors could have an
    adverse impact on our financial operations.

In Europe, we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we
    have in the U.S., and we may have difficulty developing
    successful distribution strategies and alliances in each of the
    major European countries. In Asia (including Japan), our primary
    mode of distribution is via a network of shops located within
    leading department stores. We may have difficulty in
    successfully retaining this network, and expanding into
    alternate distribution channels. Additionally, macroeconomic
    trends may not be favorable, and could limit our ability to
    implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we
    have foreign operations, such as Europe and Asia.

Our
    business could suffer as a result of consolidations,
    liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the
    retail industry.

Several of our department store customers, including some under
    common ownership, account for significant portions of our
    wholesale net sales. A substantial portion of sales of our
    licensed products by our domestic licensing partners, including
    sales made by our sales force of Ralph Lauren Home products, are
    also made to our largest department store customers. In the
    aggregate, our five largest department-store customers accounted
    for approximately 45% of our wholesale net sales during Fiscal
    2010. There can be no assurance that consolidations,
    restructurings, reorganizations or other ownership changes in
    the department store sector will not have a material adverse
    effect on our wholesale business.

We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
    commitments with our customers for each of our lines every
    season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores
    or any other significant customer, whether motivated by
    competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
    decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from
    us or our licensing partners; or to change their manner of doing
    business with us or our licensing partners or their new
    strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued
    focus on further development of their “private label”
    initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business or financial condition.

Our
    profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on
    margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure
    caused by many factors, including intense competition,
    consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to
    reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending
    patterns. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices
    to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin
    to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory
    levels

and/or

otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in
    our operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to
    sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our
    profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Certain
    legal proceedings and regulatory matters could adversely impact
    our results of operations.

We are involved in certain legal proceedings and are subject
    from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of
    contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims,
    credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail
    store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters
    and other litigations. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if
    decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in
    material liability to the Company or have a negative impact on
    the Company’s reputation or relations with its employees,
    customers, licensees or other third parties. In addition,
    regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory
    proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs
    and may require that the Company devotes substantial time and
    resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental
    regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries where
    we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on
    our results of operations. See Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion of
    the Company’s legal matters.



Our
    business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are
    disrupted or cease to operate effectively.

The Company relies heavily on its computer systems to record and
    process transactions and manage and operate our business. We
    also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the
    processing of basic replenishment orders from our wholesale
    customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels,
    and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
    In addition, we have

e-commerce

and other Internet websites in the U.S. Given the
    complexity of our business and the significant number of
    transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is
    imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer
    hardware and software systems. Despite our preventative efforts,
    our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or
    interruption from, among other things, security breaches,
    computer viruses or power outages.

A privacy
    breach could damage the Company’s reputation and its
    relationships with its customers, expose the Company to
    litigation risk and adversely affect the Company’s
    business.

As part of the Company’s normal course of business, the
    Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and
    confidential customer information. Despite the security measures
    the Company has in place, the Company’s facilities and
    systems, and those of the Company’s third party service
    providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of
    vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming

and/or

human
    errors, or other similar events. Any security breach involving
    the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of
    confidential information, whether by the Company or its vendors,
    could severely damage the Company’s reputation and its
    relationships with its customers, expose the Company to risks of
    litigation and liability and adversely affect the Company’s
    business.

Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.

As of April 3, 2010, we source a significant portion of our
    products outside the U.S. through arrangements with over
    400 foreign vendors in various countries. In Fiscal 2010, over
    98%, by dollar value, of our products were produced outside the
    U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. Risks
    inherent in importing our products include:

•

quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements with China and
    non-WTO countries. These agreements limit the amount and type of
    goods that may be imported annually from these countries;

•

changes in social, political and economic conditions or
    terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from
    the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are
    located;

•

the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or
    exports;

•

the imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports or exports;

•

significant fluctuations of the cost of raw materials;

•

significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security
    considerations;

•

the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings
    resulting in the potential assessment of special antidumping or
    countervailing duties; and

•

the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties
    either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy
    perceived illegal actions by national governments.

Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.



Our
    ability to conduct business in international markets may be
    affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
    risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets
    and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing
    international markets is subject to risks associated with
    international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.

We are also subject to general political and economic risks in
    connection with our international operations, including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other
    similar restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European
    Union, Asia, or other countries upon the import or export of our
    products in the future, or what effect any of these actions
    would have on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social or
    economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse
    effect on our business in the future or may require us to
    significantly modify our current business practices.

Our
    trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
    adequately protected outside the U.S.

We believe that our trademarks, intellectual property and other
    proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and
    our competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the
    establishment and protection of our trademarks and
    anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. Significant
    counterfeiting of our products continues, however, and in the
    course of our international expansion we have experienced
    conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or
    claimed ownership rights in some trademarks that include Polo

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise
    have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past
    resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action
    and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken
    to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary
    rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material
    adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation
    of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and
    proprietary rights of others. Also, there can be no assurance
    that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of,
    trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will
    be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
    satisfaction or at all. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
    countries do not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights
    to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. See
    Item 1 —

“Business

—

Trademarks,”

and
    Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings.”

Our
    business could suffer as a result of increases in the price of
    raw materials or a manufacturer’s inability to produce our
    goods on time and to our specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend
    exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of
    all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our
    specifications primarily by international manufacturers. During
    Fiscal 2010, less than 2%, by dollar value, of our men’s
    and women’s products were manufactured in the U.S. and
    over 98%, by dollar value, of these products were manufactured
    in other countries. The inability of a manufacturer to ship
    orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality
    standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements
    of our customers for those items, which could result in
    cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a
    substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations. Additionally, prices



of raw materials used to manufacture our products may fluctuate
    and increases in prices of such raw materials could have a
    material adverse effect on our cost of sales.

Our
    business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use
    acceptable labor practices.

We require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers
    to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote
    ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and
    monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do
    not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The
    violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer
    used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence
    of an independent manufacturer’s or licensing
    partner’s labor practices from those generally accepted as
    ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt, or
    otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or
    damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if we need to replace
    manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the production capacity of
    our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these
    competitors have greater financial and other resources than we
    have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for
    production and import quota capacity. If we experience a
    significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
    of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party
    manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional
    capacity will be available when required on terms that are
    acceptable to us. See Item 1 —

“Business

—

Sourcing, Production and Quality.”

We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each
    season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design
    and quality specifications and other standard industry
    provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any
    manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our
    products exclusively.

Our
    business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency
    fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars.
    However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result,
    the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the
    value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
    rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
    currency denominated prices at which our international
    businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales
    and licensing revenue generally is derived from sales in foreign
    currencies. These foreign currencies include the Japanese Yen,
    the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, and this revenue could
    be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Although we
    hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot
    assure that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a
    material adverse impact on our financial condition and results
    of operations. See Item 7 —

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

—

Market
    Risk Management.”

We rely
    on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our
    licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our
    licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks
    specific to a licensing partner’s business, including, for
    example, risks associated with a particular licensing
    partner’s ability to:

•

obtain capital;

•

manage its labor relations;

•

maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively; and

•

maintain relationships with its customers.

Although a number of our license agreements prohibit licensing
    partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our
    competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded
    from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered
    by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of
    sales of our



products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our
    largest customers. While we have significant control over our
    licensing partners’ products and advertising, we rely on
    our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and
    financial control over their businesses. Changes in management,
    reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution or financial
    difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could
    adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced
    licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of
    our other products. See Item 1 —

“Business

—

Our Licensing
    Segment.”

Failure
    to maintain licensing partners could harm our
    business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we could replace
    existing licensing partners if necessary, our inability to do so
    for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Our Licensing Segment.”

The
    voting shares of the Company’s stock are concentrated in
    one majority stockholder.

As of April 3, 2010, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities
    controlled by the Lauren family, owned approximately 84% of the
    voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company. As
    a result, Mr. Lauren has the ability to exercise
    significant control over our business, including, without
    limitation, (i) the election of the Company’s
    Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a
    class, and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our
    stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our
    certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or
    sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

The
    trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall
    based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other
    financial performance.

Our business planning process is designed to maximize our
    long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an
    earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe
    that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the
    Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we
    recognize that from time to time it may be helpful to provide
    investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast
    of net sales and earnings. While we generally expect to provide
    updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal
    quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our
    forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. If and
    when we announce actual results that differ from those that have
    been predicted by us, outside analysts or others, the market
    price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on
    the predictions when making investment decisions with respect to
    our securities do so at their own risk. We take no
    responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such
    changes in the prices of our securities.

Risks
    Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete

The
    downturn in the global economy may continue to affect consumer
    purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products,
    which could adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic
    factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer
    spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance, accessories and
    home products industries, including, among others:

•

general business conditions;

•

economic downturns;

•

employment levels;

•

downturns in the stock market;

•

interest rates;

•

the housing market;

•

consumer debt levels;



•

the availability of consumer credit;

•

increases in fuel prices;

•

taxation; and

•

consumer confidence in future economic conditions.

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail
    products, including our products, may continue to decline during
    recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income
    is lower. A continuing downturn or an uncertain outlook in the
    economies in which we, or our licensing partners, sell our
    products may materially adversely affect our businesses and our
    revenues and profits. See Item 7 —

“Overview

—

Our Objectives and
    Risks”

for further discussion.

The domestic and international political situation also affects
    consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of
    terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to
    a decrease in consumer spending and may materially adversely
    affect our business, revenues and profits.

We face
    intense competition in the worldwide apparel industry.

We face a variety of intense competitive challenges from other
    domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual apparel
    producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more
    diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources
    than we have. We compete with these companies primarily on the
    basis of:

•

anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty and reputation
    for quality;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors
    and styles that appeal to consumers;

•

appropriately pricing products;

•

failure to anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;

•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain
    efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective
    presentation of our products at retail stores.

We also face increasing competition from companies selling
    apparel and home products through the Internet. Although we sell
    our products domestically through the Internet, increased
    competition in the worldwide apparel, accessories and home
    product industries from Internet-based competitors could reduce
    our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our results
    of operations.

The
    success of our business depends on our ability to respond to
    constantly changing fashion trends and consumer
    demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate
    and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as
    to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of
    consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with
    certainty and are subject to rapid change. We cannot assure that
    we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
    successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the
    future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or
    brands that we introduce will be successfully received by
    consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and
    respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion
    trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of
    our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold
    inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be
    forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of
    excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business and
    impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate
    consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to
    supply quality products in a timely



manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may result
    in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships,
    diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues. See

    Production and Quality.”

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

California
    Class Action Litigation

On October 11, 2007 and November 2, 2007, two class
    action lawsuits were filed by two customers in state court in
    California asserting that while they were shopping at certain of
    the Company’s factory stores in California, the Company
    allegedly required them to provide certain personal information
    at the

point-of-sale

in order to complete a credit card purchase. The plaintiffs
    purported to represent a class of customers in California who
    allegedly were injured by being forced to provide their address
    and telephone numbers in order to use their credit



cards to purchase items from the Company’s stores, which
    allegedly violated Section 1747.08 of California’s

Song-Beverly

Act. The complaints sought an unspecified amount of statutory
    penalties, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. The
    Company subsequently had the actions moved to the United States
    District Court for the Eastern and Central Districts of
    California. The Company commenced mediation proceedings with
    respect to these lawsuits and on October 17, 2008, the
    Company agreed in principle to settle these claims by agreeing
    to issue $20 merchandise discount coupons with six month
    expiration dates to eligible parties and paying the
    plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The Court granted
    preliminary approval of the settlement terms on July 17,
    2009. In connection with this settlement, the Company recorded a
    $5 million reserve against its expected loss exposure
    during the second quarter of Fiscal 2009. As part of the
    required settlement process, the Company notified the relevant
    attorneys general regarding the potential settlement, and no
    objections were registered. At a hearing on December 7,
    2009, the Court held that the terms of the settlement were fair,
    just and reasonable and provided fair compensation for class
    members. In addition, the Court overruled an objection that had
    been filed by a single customer. The Court then denied the
    objector’s subsequent motion for the Court to reconsider
    its order on the fairness of the settlement. The period within
    which the objector had to appeal or otherwise seek relief from
    the Court’s orders expired in February 2010 without an
    appeal and the settlement is effective. Accordingly, the coupons
    were issued in February with an expiration date of
    August 16, 2010. Based on coupon redemption experience to
    date, the Company reversed $1.7 million of its original
    $5 million reserve into income during the fourth quarter of
    Fiscal 2010.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd.
    (“Wathne”), our then domestic licensee for luggage and
    handbags, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in
    the Southern District of New York against the Company and Ralph
    Lauren, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, asserting,
    among other things, federal trademark law violations, breach of
    contract, breach of obligations of good faith and fair dealing,
    fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The complaint sought,
    among other relief, injunctive relief, compensatory damages in
    excess of $250 million and punitive damages of not less
    than $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne
    withdrew this complaint from the U.S. District Court and
    filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
    New York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the Court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for breach of
    contract related claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. Following some discovery, we moved for
    summary judgment on the remaining claims. Wathne cross-moved for
    partial summary judgment. In an April 11, 2008 Decision and
    Order, the Court granted Polo’s summary judgment motion to
    dismiss most of the claims against the Company, and denied
    Wathne’s cross-motion for summary judgment. Wathne appealed
    the dismissal of its claims to the Appellate Division of the
    Supreme Court. Following a hearing on May 19, 2009, the
    Appellate Division issued a Decision and Order on June 9,
    2009 which, in large part, affirmed the lower court’s
    ruling. Discovery on those claims that were not dismissed is
    ongoing and a trial date has not yet been set. We intend to
    continue to contest the remaining claims in this lawsuit
    vigorously. Management does not expect that the ultimate
    resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

California
    Labor Litigation

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs
    purported to represent a class of employees who allegedly had
    been injured by not properly being paid commission earnings, not
    being paid overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to
    work off of the clock while waiting to enter or leave stores and
    being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave stores. The
    complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of profits,
    punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive and
    declaratory relief. Subsequent to answering the complaint, we
    had the action moved to the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California. On July 8, 2008, the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California granted plaintiffs’ motion for class
    certification and subsequently denied our motion to decertify
    the class. On November 5, 2008, the District Court stayed
    litigation of the rest break claims pending the resolution of a
    separate California Supreme Court case on the standards of class
    treatment for rest break claims. On January 25, 2010, the
    District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion to sever the rest



break claims from the rest of the case and denied our motion to
    decertify the waiting time claims. The District Court also
    ordered that a trial be held on the waiting time and overtime
    claims, which commenced on March 8, 2010. During trial, the
    parties reached an agreement to settle all of the claims in the
    litigation, including the rest break claims, for
    $4 million. The District Court held a hearing on
    May 14, 2010 and advised the parties that it would grant
    preliminary approval of the settlement. Once the Court enters an
    order granting preliminary approval of the settlement, the
    members of the class will have 60 days from the date of
    preliminary approval to submit claims or object to the
    settlement. A hearing has been scheduled for August 20,
    2010 for the District Court to determine if final approval of
    the settlement should be granted. In connection with this
    settlement, the Company recorded a $4 million reserve
    against its expected loss exposure during the fourth quarter of
    Fiscal 2010.

Other
    Matters

We are otherwise involved, from time to time, in litigation,
    other legal claims and proceedings involving matters associated
    with or incidental to our business, including, among other
    things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other
    intellectual property, licensing, and employee relations. We
    believe that the resolution of currently pending matters will
    not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
    However, our assessment of the current litigation or other legal
    claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not
    presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or
    other finders of fact which are not in accord with
    management’s evaluation of the possible liability or
    outcome of such litigation or claims.

Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash
    dividend program on its common stock. On November 4, 2009,
    the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to
    the Company’s quarterly cash dividend on its common stock
    from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share. Approximately
    $30 million was recorded as a reduction to retained
    earnings during Fiscal 2010 in connection with the
    Company’s dividends.

As of May 21, 2010, there were 1,103 holders of record of
    our Class A common stock and 15 holders of record of our
    Class B common stock. All of our outstanding shares of
    Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and entities
    controlled by the Lauren family and are



convertible at any time into shares of Class A common stock
    on a

one-for-one

basis. During Fiscal 2010, Mr. Lauren converted
    1.2 million shares of Class B common stock into an
    equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to
    the terms of the security.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The following management’s discussion and analysis of
    financial condition and results of operations
    (“MD&A”) should be read together with our audited
    consolidated financial statements and footnotes, which are
    included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for Fiscal 2010 (“Fiscal 2010

10-K”).

We utilize a

52-53 week

fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As
    such, fiscal year 2010 ended on April 3, 2010 and reflected
    a 53-week period (“Fiscal 2010”); fiscal year 2009
    ended on March 28, 2009 and reflected a 52-week period
    (“Fiscal 2009”); and fiscal year 2008 ended on
    March 29, 2008 and also reflected a 52-week period
    (“Fiscal 2008”). The inclusion of the

rd

week

    in Fiscal 2010 resulted in incremental revenues of approximately
    $70 million and increased net income of approximately
    $13 million.

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and
    distribution of premium lifestyle products including men’s,
    women’s and children’s apparel, accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishings. Our long-standing



reputation and distinctive image have been consistently
    developed across an expanding number of products, brands and
    international markets. Our brand names include

Polo by Ralph
    Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Women’s
    Collection, Black Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren,
    RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, American Living,
    Chaps

and

Club Monaco

, among others.

We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale,
    Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing
    approximately 51% of Fiscal 2010 net revenues) consists of
    wholesale-channel sales made principally to major department
    stores, specialty stores and golf and pro shops located
    throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our retail
    business (representing approximately 45% of Fiscal 2010 net
    revenues) consists of retail-channel sales directly to consumers
    through full-price and factory retail stores located throughout
    the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, through
    concessions-based shop-within-shops located primarily in Asia,
    and through our retail internet sites located at
    www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com. In addition, our
    licensing business (representing approximately 4% of Fiscal
    2010 net revenues) consists of royalty-based arrangements
    under which we license the right to third parties to use our
    various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale
    of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances,
    in specified geographical areas for specified periods.
    Approximately 30% of our Fiscal 2010 net revenues was
    earned in international regions outside of the U.S. and
    Canada. See Note 22 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues
    by geographic location.

In connection with the closing of the Asia-Pacific Licensed
    Operations Acquisition (as defined and discussed under

“Recent Developments”

) at the beginning of the
    fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, we restated our segment
    presentation to reclassify concessions-based sales arrangements
    to our Retail segment from our Wholesale segment. Segment
    information for Fiscal 2009 has been recast to conform to the
    current period’s presentation. In periods prior to Fiscal
    2009, segment information has not been recast to conform to the
    current period’s presentation, as it is impracticable to do
    so. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the restatement
    of our segment presentation.

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with
    higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth
    quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third
    quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of
    seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel,

back-to-school

and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment.

Our
    Objectives and Risks

Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury
    lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a
    proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed
    through multiple retail channels in global markets, a
    disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet.
    Despite the various risks associated with the current global
    economic environment as further discussed below, we believe our
    core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy
    for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and
    operating cash flow.

Our financial performance has been driven by the Company’s
    focus on six key objectives:

•

Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core
    and heritage-driven brand;

•

Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution
    channels and geographic regions;

•

Improving brand control and positioning;

•

Focusing on selective strategic partnerships;

•

Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a
    worldwide business; and

•

Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow.

As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control
    has evolved from primarily that of a mono-brand
    U.S. centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of
    product and geographic licenses to that of a portfolio of
    lifestyle brands with a “direct control” model over
    most of our brands, products and international territories. We
    believe that this broader and better-diversified portfolio mix
    positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers



a range of products, price points and channels of distribution,
    and our size and global operations favorably position us to take
    advantage of synergies in design, sourcing and distribution.

While balancing our long-term key strategic objectives with our
    near-term priorities to manage through the many risks associated
    with the weakened global economic environment and related
    reduction in consumer spending levels, we intend to continue to
    pursue select opportunities for growth during the course of
    Fiscal 2011 and beyond. These opportunities and continued
    investment initiatives include:

•

International Growth Opportunities

Ø

Ongoing development and integration of our recently acquired
    businesses in Asia-Pacific, including the continued execution of
    our plans to enhance our supporting organizational
    infrastructure and expand our retail businesses.

•

Direct-to-Consumer

Growth Opportunities

Ø

Global expansion of our

direct-to-consumer

presence in various formats and key markets, including

e-commerce

operations in Europe.

•

Product Innovation and Brand Extension Growth Opportunities

Ø

Further development of a wide array of luxury accessories
    product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small
    leathergoods and watches/jewelry; and

Ø

The continued expansion of our

Lauren

product line in
    international markets.

•

Investment in Operational Infrastructure

Ø

Further systems enhancements and implementations to meet the
    expanding needs of our global organization.

•

Disciplined Cost Management

Ø

The ongoing evaluation of strategies to better align our cost
    structure with lower sales trends associated with reduced levels
    of consumer spending.

Global
    Economic Developments

The state of the global economy has continued to negatively
    impact the level of consumer spending for discretionary items
    over the course of the past year. This has affected our business
    as it is highly dependent on consumer demand for our products.
    Particularly, beginning in October 2008, our Retail segment
    began to experience sharp declines in comparable store sales, as
    did many of our traditional wholesale customers. These retail
    store declines continued until the second half of Fiscal 2010
    when our Retail segment experienced positive comparable store
    sales growth due largely to the anniversarying of the lower
    benchmarks created in the prior year, as well as the realization
    of higher margins relating to improved inventory management and
    less promotional activity.

While recent statistics indicate that the U.S. and certain
    other international economies are showing some signs of
    stabilization, there are still significant macroeconomic risks,
    including high rates of unemployment and growing economic
    uncertainty in Europe. As such, we believe the global
    macroeconomic environment and the related contraction in the
    level of worldwide consumer spending will likely continue to
    have a negative effect on our sales and operating margins across
    all segments through at least Fiscal 2011. We also anticipate
    that current inflationary pressures on raw material and fuel
    costs will likely negatively affect the cost of our products and
    related gross profit percentages in Fiscal 2011.

We continue to monitor these risks and continually evaluate our
    operating strategies to adjust to any changes in economic
    conditions.

For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have
    the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially
    from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A —

“Risk Factors”

    Fiscal 2010

Summary
    of Financial Performance

Operating
    Results

In Fiscal 2010, we reported revenues of $4.979 billion, net
    income attributable to Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation
    (“PRLC”) of $479.5 million and net income per
    diluted share attributable to PRLC of $4.73. This compares to
    revenues of $5.019 billion, net income attributable to PRLC
    of $406.0 million and net income per diluted share
    attributable to PRLC of $4.01 in Fiscal 2009.

Our operating performance for Fiscal 2010 was principally
    affected by a 0.8% decline in revenues, mainly due to lower
    revenues from our global Wholesale businesses as a result of the
    ongoing challenging global retail environment. This decrease was
    largely offset by a net increase in our global Retail sales and
    the inclusion of a 53rd week of sales in Fiscal 2010, as
    well as net favorable foreign currency effects. Despite the
    overall decline in revenues, we experienced an increase in gross
    profit percentage of 380 basis points to 58.2% primarily
    due to supply chain cost savings initiatives, improved inventory
    management and decreased promotional activity particularly
    across our global Retail businesses and our European Wholesale
    operations, as well as growth in our Japanese concessions-based
    business driven by the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion). SG&A expenses increased during Fiscal
    2010 primarily driven by higher incentive-based compensation
    expenses and an increase in operating expenses attributable to
    our new business initiatives, which more than offset the
    benefits from various cost-savings initiatives implemented in
    response to the current economic downturn.

Net income and net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC
    increased in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009. This was
    primarily due to a $111.4 million increase in operating
    income, offset in part by a $28.3 million increase in the
    provision for income taxes. The increase in the provision for
    income taxes was driven by the overall increase in pretax
    income, partially offset by a 50 basis point decline in our
    effective tax rate. These results were impacted by a
    $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset
    impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax
    income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of
    the 53

rd

week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of
    increasing our net income trends by approximately
    $54 million (approximately $0.53 per diluted share).

Financial
    Condition and Liquidity

Our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of
    our business results. We ended Fiscal 2010 in a net cash and
    investments position (total cash and cash equivalents, plus
    short-term and non-current investments less total debt) of
    $940.6 million, compared to $443.2 million as of the
    end of Fiscal 2009.

The improvement in our financial position was primarily due to
    our operating cash flows, partially offset by our treasury stock
    repurchases, capital expenditures and the funding of our recent
    Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (as defined and
    discussed under

“Recent Developments”

below).
    Our equity increased to $3.117 billion as of April 3,
    2010, compared to $2.735 billion as of March 28, 2009,
    primarily due to our net income during Fiscal 2010, offset in
    part by our share repurchase activity.

We generated $906.5 million of cash from operations during
    Fiscal 2010, compared to $774.2 million during Fiscal 2009.
    We used some of our cash availability to redeem approximately
    €90.8 million principal amount of debt for
    $121.0 million, to fund our Asia-Pacific Licensed
    Operations Acquisition for $25.3 million (see

“Recent Developments”

), to support our common
    stock repurchase program and to reinvest in our business through
    capital spending. In particular, we used $231.0 million to
    repurchase 3.2 million shares of Class A common stock,
    including shares surrendered for tax withholdings. We also used
    $201.3 million for capital expenditures primarily
    associated with our global retail store expansion, construction
    and renovation of department store

shop-in-shops

and investments in our facilities and technological
    infrastructure.



Transactions
    Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

The comparability of the Company’s operating results for
    the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by
    certain transactions, including:

Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and

The comparability of the Company’s operating results has
    also been affected by the inclusion of a

rd

week

    in Fiscal 2010, which resulted in incremental revenues of
    approximately $70 million and increased net income of
    approximately $13 million.

In addition, as a result of the reclassification of
    concessions-based sales arrangements to our Retail segment from
    our Wholesale segment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of
    Fiscal 2010, segment information for Fiscal 2009 has been recast
    to conform to the current period’s presentation. Segment
    information for Fiscal 2008 has not been recast to conform to
    the current period’s presentation, as it is impracticable
    to do so. Accordingly, the related analysis of our results of
    operations for Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008 as included
    in the following MD&A has been prepared on a comparable
    basis using historical segment information.

The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as
    necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising
    from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or
    transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and
    other financial statement users individually should consider the
    types of events and transactions that have affected operating
    trends.

Recent
    Developments

Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition

On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel business in Asia-Pacific (excluding
    Japan) from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets from Dickson Concepts International
    Limited and affiliates (“Dickson”) in exchange for an
    initial payment of approximately $20 million and other
    consideration of approximately $17 million (the
    “Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition”).
    Dickson was the Company’s licensee for Polo-branded apparel
    in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), which is comprised
    of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
    Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. The Company funded the
    Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash
    on-hand.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded apparel business
    in Asia-Pacific have been consolidated in the Company’s
    results of operations commencing January 1, 2010.



Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition

On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the
    Polo-branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan
    from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai
    Co. Ltd. (“Naigai”) in exchange for a payment of
    approximately ¥2.8 billion (approximately
    $26 million as of the acquisition date) and certain other
    consideration (the “Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition”). The Company funded the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on-hand.
    Naigai was the Company’s licensee for childrenswear, golf
    apparel and hosiery under the

Polo by Ralph Lauren

and

Ralph Lauren

brands in Japan. In conjunction with the
    Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, the Company also
    entered into an additional

5-year

licensing and design-related agreement with Naigai for Polo and
    Chaps-branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services
    agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human
    resources and information systems-related services over a period
    of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the
    transaction.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded childrenswear and
    golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the
    Company’s results of operations commencing August 2,
    2008.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues decreased by
    $40.0 million, or 0.8%, to $4.979 billion in Fiscal
    2010 from $5.019 billion in Fiscal 2009. The decrease was
    primarily due to lower revenues from our global Wholesale
    businesses, partially offset by a net increase in our global
    Retail sales and net favorable foreign currency effects. Also
    offsetting the decrease in revenues was the inclusion of a

rd

week

    in Fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2009, which
    resulted in incremental revenues of approximately
    $70 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net
    revenues decreased by 1.1%. On a reported basis, Wholesale
    revenues decreased by $217.1 million, primarily as a result
    of global net sales declines in most of our product lines
    largely due to the ongoing challenging global retail
    environment. Retail revenues increased by $188.9 million,
    primarily as a result of growth in RalphLauren.com sales,
    increased revenues from our Japanese businesses largely as a
    result of the childrenswear and golf acquisition and continued
    global store expansion. The increase in Retail revenues also
    reflected incremental sales from our newly acquired Polo-branded
    apparel business in Asia-Pacific. Licensing revenue decreased by
    $11.8 million, primarily due to declines in product and
    home licensing royalties driven by lower fragrance and
    paint-related royalties, respectively, as well as a decrease in
    international licensing royalties due to the loss of licensing
    revenues from the newly acquired Polo-branded apparel business
    in Asia-Pacific and childrenswear and golf businesses in Japan
    (all now consolidated as part of the Retail segment).

Wholesale net revenues

— The net decrease
    primarily reflects:

•

a $154 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic
    businesses primarily due to a decrease in womenswear, menswear
    and childrenswear sales (including a decline in revenues from
    related

American Living

product categories) as a result
    of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment (as
    discussed further in the

“Overview”

section),
    offset in part by higher footwear sales driven by increased door
    penetration;

•

a $36 million net decrease in our Japanese businesses on a
    constant currency basis primarily due to a decrease in
    womenswear sales largely as a result of the ongoing challenging
    global retail environment;

•

a $25 million net decrease in our European businesses on a
    constant currency basis primarily driven by decreased sales in
    our menswear and childrenswear product lines, partially offset
    by an increase in womenswear sales largely due to the inclusion
    of revenues from the newly launched

Lauren

product
    line; and

•

a $2 million net decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable
    foreign currency effect related to the overall weakening of the
    Euro, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency effect
    related to the strengthening of the Yen, both in comparison to
    the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010.

The total net decrease in Wholesale revenues discussed above
    included an approximate $30 million increase due to the
    inclusion of an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared
    to Fiscal 2009.

Retail net revenues

— For purposes of the
    discussion of Retail operating performance below, we refer to
    the measure “comparable store sales.” Comparable store
    sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for
    at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing
    during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of



comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either
    relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage
    expansion of 25% or greater) or generally closed for 30 or more
    consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the
    calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have
    been in their new location or in a newly renovated state for at
    least one full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information
    includes both Ralph Lauren (including Rugby) and Club Monaco
    stores, as well as concessions-based shop-within-shops and
    RalphLauren.com.

The net increase in Retail net revenues primarily reflects:

•

a $163 million aggregate net increase in non-comparable
    store sales primarily driven by:

Ø

a $40 million increase in revenues due to the inclusion of
    an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009;

Ø

an increase of approximately $32 million on a constant
    currency basis related to the inclusion of a full year of
    revenues from our concessions-based shop-within-shops assumed in
    connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion);

Ø

the inclusion of $29 million of sales from stores and
    concessions-based shop-within-shops assumed in connection with
    the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion);

Ø

an increase related to new store openings within the past twelve
    months. There was a net increase in average global store count
    of 9 stores, to a total of 350 stores, as compared to Fiscal
    2009. The net increase in store count was primarily due to a
    number of new domestic and international full-price and factory
    store openings as well as the inclusion of stores acquired in
    Asia-Pacific region, offset in part by the closure of certain
    Club Monaco stores; and

Ø

a net aggregate favorable foreign currency effect of
    $16 million primarily related to the strengthening of the
    Yen, partially offset by the overall weakening of the Euro, both
    in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010.

•

a $6 million aggregate net decrease in comparable physical
    store sales driven by our global full-price stores, including a
    net aggregate unfavorable foreign currency effect of
    $2 million primarily related to the overall weakening of
    the Euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the Yen, both
    in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. This
    decrease was more than offset by a $32 million increase in
    RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable store sales under the
    Company’s new (recasted) basis of reporting are presented
    below on a 52-week basis:

Licensing revenue

— The net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

a $8 million decrease in international licensing royalties,
    primarily due to the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition as well as the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion); and

•

a $5 million decrease in home licensing royalties primarily
    driven by lower paint and bedding and bath-related royalties.

The above net decrease was partially offset by:

•

a $1 million net increase in product licensing royalties
    primarily driven by higher footwear royalties, partially offset
    by lower fragrance-related royalties.

Gross Profit.

Cost of goods sold includes the
    expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale,
    including product costs, freight-in and import costs, as well as
    changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability.
    The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated
    with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking,
    packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in
    SG&A expenses.

Gross profit increased by $168.4 million, or 6.2%, to
    $2.899 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $2.731 billion in
    Fiscal 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
    increased by 380 basis points to 58.2% in Fiscal 2010 from
    54.4% in Fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to supply
    chain cost savings initiatives, improved inventory management
    and decreased promotional activity particularly across our
    global Retail businesses and our European Wholesale operations,
    as well as growth in our Japanese concessions-based business
    driven by the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion).

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a
    variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix
    among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products
    sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs.
    These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.

We anticipate that current macroeconomic challenges, including
    inflationary pressures on raw material and fuel costs, could
    negatively affect the cost of our products and related gross
    profit percentages in Fiscal 2011. See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors”

for further discussion.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses primarily include
    compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts,
    information technology, facilities, legal and other costs
    associated with finance and administration. SG&A expenses
    increased by $121.0 million, or 5.9%, to
    $2.157 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $2.036 billion in
    Fiscal 2009. The increase included an unfavorable foreign
    currency effect of approximately $15 million, primarily
    related to the strengthening of the Yen in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. SG&A expenses as a
    percent of net revenues increased to 43.3% in Fiscal 2010 from
    40.6% in Fiscal 2009. The 270 basis point increase was
    primarily driven by the decrease in net revenues as well as
    higher compensation-related expenses and an increase in
    operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives.
    Including the $15 million unfavorable foreign currency
    effect, the $121.0 million increase in SG&A expenses
    was primarily driven by:

•

higher compensation-related expenses of approximately
    $78 million primarily relating to an increase in
    incentive-based compensation;

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs of approximately
    $35 million related to our newly acquired Polo-branded
    apparel business in Asia-Pacific (see

“Recent
    Developments”

for further discussion);

•

an approximate $22 million increase related to the
    inclusion of a full year of SG&A costs for our recently
    acquired Japanese childrenswear and golf businesses in
    comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, including
    costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements (see

“Recent Developments”

for further
    discussion); and



•

an approximate $17 million increase in rent and utility
    costs primarily to support the ongoing global growth of our
    businesses.

The above increases were partially offset by lower SG&A
    expenses associated with the Company’s cost-savings
    initiatives implemented in late Fiscal 2009, as well as:

•

lower selling expenses of approximately $28 million
    principally relating to lower wholesale sales; and

•

an approximate $14 million decrease in brand-related
    marketing and advertising costs.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $1.5 million, or 7.4%, to $21.7 million
    in Fiscal 2010 from $20.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This
    increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of
    amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in
    connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, as well
    as amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection
    with the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion).

Impairments of Assets.

A non-cash impairment
    charge of $6.6 million was recognized in Fiscal 2010,
    compared to $55.4 million in Fiscal 2009. These charges
    reduced the net carrying values of certain long-lived assets,
    primarily in the Company’s Retail segment, to their
    estimated fair values. These impairment charges were primarily
    attributable to the

lower-than-expected

operating performances of certain retail stores, which in Fiscal
    2009 arose in large part due to the significant contraction in
    consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that
    fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $6.9 million recognized in Fiscal 2010 primarily related
    to employee termination costs, as well as the write-down of an
    asset associated with exiting a retail store in Japan.
    Restructuring charges of $23.6 million recognized in Fiscal
    2009 were primarily associated with a restructuring plan
    initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better
    align the Company’s cost base with lower sales and
    operating margin trends associated with the slowdown in consumer
    spending, and to improve overall operating effectiveness (the
    “Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan”). This Fiscal 2009
    Restructuring Plan included a reduction in workforce and the
    closure of certain underperforming retail stores. See
    Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    by $111.4 million, or 18.7%, to $706.9 million in
    Fiscal 2010 from $595.5 million in Fiscal 2009. Operating
    income as a percentage of net revenues increased 230 basis
    points, to 14.2% in Fiscal 2010 from 11.9% in Fiscal 2009. The
    increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues
    primarily reflected the increase in gross profit margin and
    lower pretax charges related to asset impairments and
    restructurings, partially offset by the increase in SG&A
    expenses as a percent of net revenues, as previously discussed.

Wholesale operating income

decreased by
    $34.6 million primarily as a result of lower revenues,
    partially offset by higher gross margins driven by improved
    inventory management principally in our European businesses.



Retail operating income

increased by $152.5 million
    primarily as a result of increased revenues and higher gross
    margins across our global Retail businesses driven by decreased
    promotional activity and lower reductions in the carrying cost
    of our retail inventory. The increase also was due to lower
    impairment-related charges. These increases were partially
    offset by increased SG&A expenses primarily driven by
    higher rent and incentive-based compensation expenses.

Licensing operating income

increased by $3.8 million
    primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with the
    transition of our licensed businesses to wholly owned
    operations, offset in part by lower revenues largely driven by a
    decline in international royalties and home licensing royalties.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $23.4 million, primarily as a result of higher
    incentive-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower
    brand-related marketing and advertising costs.

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

of
    $10.0 million in Fiscal 2010 were comprised of
    restructuring charges of $6.9 million primarily related to
    employee termination costs and the write-down of an asset
    associated with exiting a retail store in Japan, as well as
    legal charges of $4.8 million primarily related to the
    Company’s California Labor Litigation matter offset in part
    by the reversal of an excess legal reserve of $1.7 million
    (see Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion). In Fiscal 2009,
    unallocated legal and restructuring charges of
    $23.1 million were comprised of restructuring charges of
    $23.6 million primarily associated with the Fiscal 2009
    Restructuring Plan, as previously discussed, offset by a
    reversal of an excess legal reserve in the amount of
    $0.5 million.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to a gain of
    $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009. Excluding a net increase in
    foreign currency gains of $1.0 million relating to
    undesignated foreign currency hedge contracts, the increase in
    foreign currency losses in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal
    2009 was primarily due to the timing of the settlement of
    intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a
    long-term investment nature) between certain of our
    international and domestic subsidiaries. Foreign currency gains
    and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value
    of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including
    amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our
    capital lease obligations. Interest expense decreased by
    $4.4 million, or 16.5%, to $22.2 million in Fiscal
    2010 from $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009. This decrease was
    primarily due to a lower principal amount of our outstanding
    Euro-denominated 4.5% notes as a result of a partial debt
    extinguishment in July 2009.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, decreased by $9.6 million, or 43.6%, to
    $12.4 million in Fiscal 2010 from $22.0 million in
    Fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower yields relating to lower
    market rates of interest. This decrease was offset in part by an
    increase in our average balance of cash and cash equivalents and
    investments during Fiscal 2010, as well as a net gain of
    $4.1 million related to a partial extinguishment of the
    Company’s Euro-denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

The equity in loss of equity-method
    investees of $5.6 million in Fiscal 2010 related to the
    Company’s share of loss from its joint venture, the Ralph
    Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL Watch
    Company”), which is accounted for under the equity method
    of accounting. The equity in loss of equity-method investees of
    $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 related to the Company’s
    share of loss driven by certain

start-up

costs associated with the RL Watch Company.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by
    $28.3 million, or 15.6%, to $209.8 million in Fiscal
    2010 from $181.5 million in Fiscal 2009. The increase in
    provision for income taxes was primarily a result of higher
    pretax income in Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009. This
    increase was partially offset by a net decline in our reported
    effective tax rate of 50 basis points, to 30.4% in Fiscal
    2010 from 30.9% in Fiscal 2009. The lower effective tax rate was
    primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings generated in
    lower-taxed jurisdictions as well as tax reserve reductions
    principally associated with audit settlements, offset in part by
    certain higher non-deductible expenses. The effective tax rate
    differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and
    local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain
    nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from
    year to year based on non-recurring factors including, but not
    limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and
    amount of



foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local
    taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction
    of various global tax strategies.

Net Income Attributable to PRLC.

Net income
    increased by $73.5 million, or 18.1%, to
    $479.5 million in Fiscal 2010 from $406.0 million in
    Fiscal 2009. The increase in net income was primarily due to a
    $111.4 million increase in operating income, offset in part
    by a $28.3 million increase in the provision for income
    taxes, as previously discussed. These results were impacted by a
    $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset
    impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax
    income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of
    the 53

rd

week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of
    increasing our net income trends by approximately
    $54 million.

Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to
    PRLC.

Net income per diluted share increased by
    $0.72, or 18.0%, to $4.73 per share in Fiscal 2010 from $4.01
    per share in Fiscal 2009. The increase in diluted per share
    results was due to the higher level of net income, as previously
    discussed. These results were impacted by a $65.5 million
    reduction in pretax charges related to asset impairments and
    restructurings as well as increased pretax income of
    approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of the

rd

week

    in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of
    increasing our net income per diluted share trends by
    approximately $0.53.

As discussed in the

“Overview”

section, segment
    information for Fiscal 2008 has not been recast to reflect the
    reclassification of concessions-based sales arrangements to our
    Retail segment from our Wholesale segment at the beginning of
    the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010. In order to present operating
    results on a comparable basis, the following analysis of our
    results of operations for Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008
    has been prepared using historical segment information.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $138.8 million, or 2.8%, to $5.019 billion in Fiscal
    2009 from $4.880 billion in Fiscal 2008. The increase was
    principally due to growth in our global Wholesale business,
    increased global Retail sales, and net favorable foreign
    currency effects. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net
    revenues increased by 2.2%. On a reported basis, Wholesale
    revenues increased by $129.1 million, primarily as a result
    of the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the newly
    launched

American Living

product line and increased
    revenues from our European and Japanese businesses, offset in
    part by decreased sales in our core domestic product lines.
    Retail revenues increased by $23.9 million primarily as a
    result of continued global store expansion and growth in
    RalphLauren.com sales, partially offset by a net decline in
    comparable store sales. Licensing revenue decreased by
    $14.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in international
    licensing royalties as a result of the Japanese Childrenswear
    and Golf Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion).

Net revenues for our three business segments under the
    Company’s historical basis of reporting are provided below:

Wholesale net revenues

— The net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

a $74 million net increase in our European businesses on a
    constant currency basis driven by increased sales in our
    menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines, partially
    offset by an increase in promotional activity;

•

a $47 million net increase in our Japanese operations on a
    constant currency basis primarily as a result of the inclusion
    of revenues from the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    (see

“Recent Developments”

for further
    discussion), offset in part by sales declines in our core
    businesses; and

•

a $37 million net increase in revenues due to a favorable
    foreign currency effect related to the strengthening of the Yen,
    partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect
    related to the weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

a $29 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic
    businesses primarily due to reduced shipments across our core
    menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines as a result
    of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment (as
    discussed further in the

“Overview”

section).
    Offsetting this decrease was the inclusion of a full year of
    revenues from the newly launched

American Living

product
    line and an increase in footwear sales largely attributable to
    increased door penetration.



Retail net revenues

— The net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

an $81 million aggregate net increase in non-comparable
    store sales, primarily relating to new store openings within the
    past twelve months. There was a net increase in average global
    store count of 21 stores, to a total of 326 stores, as compared
    to the prior fiscal year. The net increase in store count was
    primarily due to a number of new domestic and international
    full-price and factory store openings.

The above increase was partially offset by:

•

an $84 million aggregate net decrease in comparable
    physical store sales driven by our global full-price stores,
    including an aggregate net unfavorable foreign currency effect
    of $13 million primarily related to the weakening of the
    Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. This
    decrease was partially offset by a $27 million increase in
    RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable store sales under the
    Company’s historical basis of reporting are provided below:

Licensing revenue

— The net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

a $17 million decrease in international licensing
    royalties, primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion).

The above decrease was partially offset by:

•

a $3 million increase in domestic licensing royalties,
    primarily driven by increases in men’s personal apparel and
    the inclusion of a full year of royalties for

American
    Living

. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
    in fragrance-related royalties.

Gross Profit.

Cost of goods sold includes the
    expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale,
    including product costs, freight-in and import costs, as well as
    changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability.
    The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated
    with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking,
    packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in
    SG&A expenses.

Gross profit increased by $92.6 million, or 3.5%, to
    $2.731 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $2.638 billion in
    Fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
    increased by 30 basis points to 54.4% in Fiscal 2009 from
    54.1% in Fiscal 2008, primarily driven by the growth of our
    European and Japanese wholesale operations, as well as the net
    decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects associated
    with prior business acquisitions. These increases were partially
    offset by increased markdown activity and higher reductions in
    the carrying cost of our retail inventory, largely as a result
    of the economic downturn.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses primarily include
    compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts,
    information technology, facilities, legal and other costs
    associated with finance and



administration. SG&A expenses increased by
    $103.5 million, or 5.4%, to $2.036 billion in Fiscal
    2009 from $1.932 billion in Fiscal 2008. The increase
    included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of
    approximately $14 million, primarily related to the
    strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the weakening of
    the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal
    2009. SG&A expenses as a percent of net revenues increased
    to 40.6% in Fiscal 2009 from 39.6% in Fiscal 2008. The
    100 basis point increase was primarily driven by increased
    operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives.
    The $103.5 million increase in SG&A expenses was
    primarily driven by:

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs of approximately
    $38 million related to our recently acquired Japanese
    childrenswear and golf businesses, including costs incurred
    pursuant to transition service arrangements (see

“Recent
    Developments”

for further discussion);

•

higher compensation-related expenses of approximately
    $35 million principally relating to increased selling costs
    associated with higher retail sales and our ongoing product line
    expansion, including

American Living

and a dedicated
    dress business across multiple brands. These increases were
    partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense
    largely driven by a decrease in the Company’s share price
    as of the date of its annual equity award grant in the second
    quarter of Fiscal 2009 compared to the share price as of the
    comparable grant date in Fiscal 2008;

•

an approximate $29 million increase in rent and utility
    costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses,
    including rent expense related to certain retail stores
    scheduled to open in Fiscal 2010;

•

an approximate $12 million net increase in
    litigation-related charges, including approximately
    $4 million related to the reversal of an excess legal
    reserve in Fiscal 2008; and

•

an approximate $11 million increase in bad debt expenses
    due largely to the negative effects of the slowdown in the
    global economy on the financial condition and liquidity of our
    customer base.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

an approximate $20 million decrease in brand-related
    marketing and advertising costs primarily as a result of the
    implementation of related cost-savings initiatives in response
    to the economic downturn, as well as the absence of costs
    associated with the Company’s

th

Anniversary celebration in Fiscal 2008.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    decreased by $27.0 million, or 57.2%, to $20.2 million
    in Fiscal 2009 from $47.2 million in Fiscal 2008. The
    decrease was primarily due to the absence of the amortization of
    the licenses acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions,
    which were fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008.

Impairments of Assets.

An aggregate non-cash
    impairment charge of $55.4 million was recognized in Fiscal
    2009, compared to $5.0 million in Fiscal 2008. These
    charges reduced the net carrying values of certain long-lived
    assets, primarily in the Company’s Retail segment, to their
    estimated fair values. These impairment charges were primarily
    attributable to

lower-than-expected

operating performances in certain stores, which in Fiscal 2009,
    arose in large part due to the significant contraction in
    consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that
    fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $23.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2009 primarily
    associated with a restructuring plan initiated during the fourth
    quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better align the Company’s cost
    base with lower sales and operating margin trends associated
    with the slowdown in consumer spending, and to improve overall
    operating effectiveness. This Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan
    included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain
    underperforming retail stores. No restructuring charges were
    recorded in Fiscal 2008. See Note 12 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income decreased
    by $57.9 million, or 8.9%, to $595.5 million in Fiscal
    2009 from $653.4 million in Fiscal 2008. Operating income
    as a percentage of net revenues decreased 150 basis points
    to 11.9% in Fiscal 2009 from 13.4% in Fiscal 2008. The decrease
    in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily
    reflected increases in SG&A expenses, and
    $79.0 million of pretax charges related to asset
    impairments and restructurings, partially offset by a decrease
    in amortization of intangible assets, as previously discussed.

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $47.9 million primarily as a result of higher revenues, as
    well as improved gross margin largely driven by our European and
    Japanese wholesale operations. The increase also was due to the
    net decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects
    primarily associated with prior business acquisitions. These
    increases were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses
    attributable largely to our new business initiatives.

Retail operating income

decreased by $96.0 million
    primarily as a result of $47.0 million of higher
    impairment-related charges, higher reductions in the carrying
    cost of our retail inventory, and higher rent and occupancy
    costs. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues and
    the absence of certain unfavorable purchase accounting effects
    associated with the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity
    interest of Ralph Lauren Media included in the prior fiscal year.

Licensing operating income

increased by $6.9 million
    primarily as a result of a decrease in amortization of
    intangible assets due to the absence of the amortization of the
    license acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which
    was fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008. Also contributing
    to the increased operating income was an increase in domestic
    licensing royalties, primarily driven by the inclusion of
    royalties for

American Living

. These increases were
    offset in part by a net decrease in international royalties
    primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    (see

“Recent Developments”

for further
    discussion).

Unallocated corporate expenses

decreased by
    $10.5 million primarily as a result of a decrease in
    brand-related marketing and advertising costs, as well as lower
    stock-based compensation expense, as previously discussed.

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

of
    $23.1 million in Fiscal 2009 were comprised of
    restructuring charges of $23.6 million primarily associated
    with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, as previously
    discussed, offset by a reversal of an excess legal reserve in
    the amount of $0.5 million. In Fiscal 2008, unallocated
    legal and restructuring charges were comprised of a reversal of
    an excess legal reserve in the amount of $4.1 million.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain
    of $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to a loss of
    $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008. The prior fiscal year loss
    included a $1.6 million write-off of foreign currency
    option contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign
    currency exposure associated with the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions, which expired unexercised. Excluding the
    aforementioned transaction, foreign currency gains increased in
    Fiscal 2009 as compared to Fiscal 2008, primarily due to the
    timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and
    payables (that were not of a long-term investment nature)
    between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries.
    Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of
    changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating
    results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to
    U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including
    amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our
    capital lease obligations. Interest expense increased by



$0.9 million, to $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009 from
    $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008. This increase is primarily
    due to an increase in interest expense related to capital lease
    obligations, offset in part by a decrease in interest expense
    related to borrowings under a one-year term loan agreement
    repaid by the Company in May 2008.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, decreased by $2.7 million, to
    $22.0 million in Fiscal 2009 from $24.7 million in
    Fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by lower yields
    relating to lower market rates of interest in Fiscal 2009,
    offset in part by an increase in our average balance of cash and
    short-term investments during Fiscal 2009.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

The equity in loss of equity-method
    investees of $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 and
    $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 primarily related to the
    Company’s share of loss driven by certain

start-up

costs associated with the RL Watch Company, which is accounted
    for under the equity method of accounting.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by
    $40.8 million, or 18.4%, to $181.5 million in Fiscal
    2009 from $222.3 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in
    provision for income taxes was principally due to an overall
    decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal
    2008. This decrease also was due to a reduction in our reported
    effective tax rate of 360 basis points, to 30.9% in Fiscal
    2009 from 34.5% in Fiscal 2008. The lower effective tax rate was
    primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings. In
    particular, there was a greater proportion of earnings generated
    in lower-taxed jurisdictions and the tax benefits associated
    with the asset impairment and restructuring charges were
    recognized in higher-taxed jurisdictions.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling
    Interest.

Net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interest of $2.1 million in Fiscal 2008
    related to the Company’s remaining 50% interest in Polo
    Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation, which was acquired in May 2007,
    and the allocation of net income of Impact 21 Co., Ltd. to the
    holders of the 80% interest not owned by the Company prior to
    the closing date of the related acquisition. No net income
    attributable to noncontrolling interest was recorded in Fiscal
    2009 as both of these companies have been wholly owned.

Net Income Attributable to PRLC.

Net income
    attributable to PRLC decreased by $13.8 million, or 3.3%,
    to $406.0 million in Fiscal 2009 from $419.8 million
    in Fiscal 2008. This decrease principally related to a
    $57.9 million decrease in operating income, offset in part
    by a $40.8 million decrease in the provision for income
    taxes, as previously discussed. These results were negatively
    impacted by $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in
    Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and restructurings,
    which had an aggregate effect of reducing net income
    attributable to PRLC in Fiscal 2009 by $49.7 million.

Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to
    PRLC.

Net income per diluted share attributable
    to PRLC increased by $0.02, or 0.5%, to $4.01 per share in
    Fiscal 2009 from $3.99 per share in Fiscal 2008, as the effect
    of lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding was mostly
    offset by the decrease in net income attributable to PRLC in
    Fiscal 2009. These results were negatively impacted by
    $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009
    related to asset impairments and restructurings, which had an
    aggregate effect of reducing net income per diluted share
    attributable to PRLC in Fiscal 2009 by $0.49.

“Net cash and
    investments” is defined as total cash and cash equivalents,
    plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt.

The increase in the Company’s net cash and investments
    position as of April 3, 2010 as compared to March 28,
    2009 was primarily due to our operating cash flows, partially
    offset by the Company’s use of cash to support its treasury
    stock repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisition
    spending. In Fiscal 2010, the Company used $231.0 million
    to repurchase 3.2 million shares of Class A common
    stock, including shares surrendered for tax withholdings, and
    spent $201.3 million for capital expenditures. In addition,
    the Company used $25.3 million to fund its recent
    Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

). The Company’s net
    cash and investments position as of April 3, 2010 also
    reflected the repurchase of €90.8 million principal
    amount of Euro-denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009 for
    $121.0 million (see

“Debt and Covenant
    Compliance”

below for further discussion).

The increase in equity was primarily due to the Company’s
    net income in Fiscal 2010, offset in part by an increase in
    treasury stock as a result of the Company’s common stock
    repurchase program.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $906.5 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to
    $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This net increase in
    operating cash flow was primarily driven by:

•

lower accounts receivable levels due to improved cash
    collections and lower sales in the Company’s Wholesale
    segment;

•

an increase related to inventory primarily due to the effects of
    ongoing inventory management across most businesses; and

•

an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization,
    stock-based compensation and other non-cash expenses, including
    impairments of assets.



The above increases in cash provided by operating activities
    were partially offset by:

•

a decrease related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities
    primarily due to the timing of payments.

Other than the items described above, the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating
    fluctuations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $504.4 million in
    Fiscal 2010, as compared to $458.0 million in Fiscal 2009.
    The net increase in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds
    from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2010, the
    Company used $1.351 billion to purchase investments, less
    $1.072 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, the Company
    used $623.1 million to purchase investments, less
    $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments;

•

an increase in cash used in connection with capital
    expenditures. In Fiscal 2010, the Company spent
    $201.3 million for capital expenditures, as compared to
    $185.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The Company’s capital
    expenditures were primarily associated with global retail store
    expansion, construction and renovation of department store
    shop-within-shops and investments in its facilities and
    technological infrastructure; and

•

a change in cash deposits restricted in connection with taxes.
    In Fiscal 2010, net restricted cash of $6.2 million was
    released, as compared to $26.9 million of restricted cash
    released in Fiscal 2009 primarily in connection with the partial
    settlement of certain international tax matters.

The above increases in cash used in investing activities were
    partially offset by:

•

a decrease in net cash used to fund the Company’s
    acquisitions and ventures. In Fiscal 2010, the Company used
    $30.8 million primarily to fund the Asia-Pacific Licensed
    Operations Acquisition. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009,
    the Company used $46.3 million primarily to fund the
    Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition and to complete the
    minority interest buyout related to the acquisition of certain
    of the Company’s formerly-licensed Japanese businesses.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net
    cash used in financing activities was $306.4 million in
    Fiscal 2010, as compared to $352.1 million in Fiscal 2009.
    The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

a decrease in cash used in connection with the Company’s
    repayment of debt. In Fiscal 2010, the Company completed a cash
    tender offer and used $121.0 million to repurchase
    €90.8 million of principal amount of its
    4.5% notes due October 4, 2013. On a comparative
    basis, in Fiscal 2009, the Company repaid
    ¥20.5 billion ($196.8 million as of the repayment
    date) of borrowings under a one-year term loan agreement
    pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the Company’s
    existing credit facility (the “Term Loan”); and

•

an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee stock
    options. In Fiscal 2010, the Company received $50.5 million
    from the exercise of employee stock options, as compared to
    $29.0 million in Fiscal 2009.

The above decrease in cash used in financing activities was
    partially offset by:

•

an increase in cash used in connection with repurchases of the
    Company’s Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2010,
    2.9 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $215.9 million were repurchased pursuant to the
    Company’s common stock repurchase program and
    0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $15.1 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the
    Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with
    the vesting of awards under the Company’s 1997 Long-Term
    Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “1997 Plan”). On
    a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, $169.8 million of cash
    was used in connection with common stock repurchases and shares
    surrendered for tax withholdings.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to
    $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008. This net increase in
    operating cash flow was primarily driven by:

•

an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization,
    non-cash asset impairment charges, stock-based compensation and
    other non-cash expenses; and

•

an approximate $84 million decrease in cash tax payments.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

an increase in inventory primarily due to the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, offset in part by the
    effects of ongoing inventory management across most businesses.

Other than the items described above, the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating
    fluctuations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $458.0 million in
    Fiscal 2009, as compared to $505.0 million in Fiscal 2008.
    The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

a decrease in net cash used to fund the Company’s
    acquisitions and ventures. In Fiscal 2009, the Company used
    $46.3 million primarily to fund the Japanese Childrenswear
    and Golf Acquisition and to complete the minority squeeze-out
    related to the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a comparative
    basis, in Fiscal 2008, the Company used $188.7 million
    principally to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions, net of
    cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition;

•

a decrease in cash used in connection with capital expenditures.
    In Fiscal 2009, the Company spent $185.0 million for
    capital expenditures, as compared to $217.1 million in
    Fiscal 2008. The Company’s capital expenditures were
    primarily associated with global retail store expansion,
    construction and renovation of department store
    shop-within-shops and investments in its facilities and
    technological infrastructure; and

•

a change in restricted cash deposits. In Fiscal 2009, net
    restricted cash of $26.9 million was released primarily in
    connection with the partial settlement of certain international
    tax matters. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2008 included net
    restricted cash deposits of $15.1 million.

The above decreases were partially offset by:

•

an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds
    from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2009, the
    Company used $623.1 million to purchase investments, less
    $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008,
    $96.8 million was used to purchase investments, less
    $12.7 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments.



Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net
    cash used in financing activities was $352.1 million in
    Fiscal 2009, as compared to $260.5 million in Fiscal 2008.
    The increase in net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

the repayment of ¥20.5 billion ($196.8 million as
    of the repayment date) of the Term Loan in Fiscal 2009 related
    to the Japanese Business Acquisitions, as compared to the
    receipt of proceeds from the Term Loan of $168.9 million as
    of the borrowing date in Fiscal 2008; and

•

a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation
    arrangements of $22.3 million in Fiscal 2009 as compared to
    the prior fiscal year.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

a decrease in cash used in connection with repurchases of the
    Company’s Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2009,
    2.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $150.2 million (including approximately 0.4 million
    shares at a cost of $24.0 million that was traded prior to
    the end of Fiscal 2008 for which settlement occurred in April
    2008) were repurchased pursuant to the Company’s
    common stock repurchase program and 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $19.6 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the 1997 Plan. On a
    comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008, $475.4 million of cash
    was used in connection with common stock repurchases and shares
    surrendered for tax withholdings.

Liquidity

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are the cash
    flow generated from its operations, $450 million of
    availability under its credit facility, available cash and cash
    equivalents, investments and other available financing options.
    These sources of liquidity are used to fund the Company’s
    ongoing cash requirements, including working capital
    requirements, global retail store expansion, construction and
    renovation of

shop-in-shops,

investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, joint
    ventures, dividends, debt repayment/repurchase, stock
    repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax
    positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes
    that the Company’s existing sources of cash will be
    sufficient to support its operating, capital and debt service
    requirements for the foreseeable future, including the
    finalization of potential acquisitions and plans for business
    expansion.

As discussed in the

“Debt and Covenant
    Compliance”

section below, the Company had no revolving
    credit borrowings outstanding under its credit facility as of
    April 3, 2010. As discussed further below, the Company may
    elect to draw on its credit facility or other potential sources
    of financing for, among other things, a material acquisition,
    settlement of a material contingency (including uncertain tax
    positions) or a material adverse business development, as well
    as for other general corporate business purposes. The Company
    believes its credit facility is adequately diversified with no
    undue concentrations in any one financial institution. In
    particular, as of April 3, 2010, there were 13 financial
    institutions participating in the credit facility, with no one
    participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in
    excess of approximately 20%. Management has no reason at this
    time to believe that the participating institutions will be
    unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in
    accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility (as defined
    below) in the event of the Company’s election to draw funds
    in the foreseeable future.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

On November 4, 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved an expansion of the Company’s existing common
    stock repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase
    up to an additional $225 million of Class A common
    stock. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are
    subject to overall business and market conditions.

In Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of
    $215.9 million under its repurchase program. The remaining
    availability under the Company’s common stock repurchase
    program was approximately $275 million as of April 3,
    2010. In addition, in Fiscal 2010, 0.3 million



shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $15.1 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the
    Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with
    the vesting of awards under the 1997 Plan.

In Fiscal 2009, 1.8 million shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of
    $126.2 million. Also, during the first quarter of Fiscal
    2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of Fiscal
    2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. In addition,
    in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of Class A common
    stock at a cost of $19.6 million were surrendered to, or
    withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in
    connection with the vesting of awards under the 1997 Plan.

In Fiscal 2008, share repurchases amounted to 6.1 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $476.4 million, including $24.0 million
    (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of
    the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. In
    addition, in Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the 1997 Plan.

On May 18, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a further expansion of the Company’s existing
    common stock repurchase program that allows the Company to
    repurchase up to an additional $275 million of Class A
    common stock.

Dividends

Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash
    dividend program on its common stock. On November 4, 2009,
    the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to
    the Company’s quarterly cash dividend on its common stock
    from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share. Dividends paid amounted
    to $24.7 million in Fiscal 2010, $19.9 million in
    Fiscal 2009 and $20.5 million in Fiscal 2008.

The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly
    dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision
    to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
    discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will
    depend on, among other things, the Company’s results of
    operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other
    factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Debt
    and Covenant Compliance

Euro
    Debt

As of April 3, 2010, the Company had outstanding
    €209.2 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due
    October 4, 2013 (the “Euro Debt”). The Company
    has the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any
    time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a
    premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the
    outstanding Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest
    in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax
    law. Partial redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in
    either instance. In the event of a change of control of the
    Company, each holder of the Euro Debt has the option to require
    the Company to redeem the Euro Debt at its principal amount plus
    accrued interest. The indenture governing the Euro Debt (the
    “Indenture”) contains certain limited covenants that
    restrict the Company’s ability, subject to specified
    exceptions, to incur liens or enter into a sale and leaseback
    transaction for any principal property. The Indenture does not
    contain any financial covenants.

As of April 3, 2010, the carrying value of the Euro Debt
    was $282.1 million, compared to $406.4 million as of
    March 28, 2009.

In July 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer and used
    $121.0 million to repurchase €90.8 million of
    principal amount of its then outstanding €300 million
    principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 at
    a discounted purchase price of approximately 95%. A net pretax
    gain of $4.1 million related to this extinguishment of debt
    was recorded during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 and has
    been classified as a component of interest and other income,
    net, in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
    The Company used its cash on hand to fund the debt
    extinguishment.



Revolving
    Credit Facility and Term Loan

The Company has a credit facility that provides for a
    $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through
    November 2011 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
    Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of April 3, 2010, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility and the Company was
    contingently liable for $13.9 million of outstanding
    letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase
    commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its
    borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the
    agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
    facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory
    reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the
    Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility
    (“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. The Credit Facility also requires the Company to
    maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated
    EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”) of no greater than 3.75
    as of the date of measurement for four consecutive quarters.
    Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt
    outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent expense for the last
    twelve months. EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net
    income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest
    expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and
    (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of April 3, 2010,
    no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the
    Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s Credit
    Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenant described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of
    Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and entities controlled by
    the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum
    percentage of the voting power of the Company’s common
    stock.

The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22,
    2007 to provide for the addition of a ¥20.5 billion
    Term Loan, made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary
    of the Company. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to
    finance the Company’s acquisition of certain of its
    formerly-licensed Japanese businesses. The Company repaid the
    Term Loan by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using
    $196.8 million of the cash on-hand acquired as part of the
    acquisition. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions.

Contractual
    and Other Obligations

Firm
    Commitments

The following table summarizes certain of the Company’s
    aggregate contractual obligations as of April 3, 2010, and
    the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are
    expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flow
    in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm

The following is a description of the Company’s material,
    firmly committed contractual obligations as of April 3,
    2010:

•

Euro debt

represents the principal amount due at maturity
    of the Company’s outstanding Euro Debt on a
    U.S. dollar-equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any
    fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments;

•

Lease obligations

represent the minimum lease rental
    payments under noncancelable leases for the Company’s real
    estate and operating equipment in various locations around the
    world. Approximately 60% of these lease obligations relates to
    the Company’s retail operations. Information has been
    presented separately for operating and capital leases. In
    addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to
    pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased
    real estate properties; and

•

Inventory purchase commitments

represent the
    Company’s legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or
    minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices.

Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the
    non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
    $126.0 million as of April 3, 2010. This liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the above table
    because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the
    period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.

The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts
    included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheet as of April 3, 2010 as these items will be paid
    within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have
    no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue)
    or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do
    not represent a “purchase obligation” as the term is
    used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items).

The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would
    require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See
    Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for a description of the Company’s contingent
    commitments not included in the above table.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company’s off-balance sheet firm commitments, which
    include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding
    commitments to investees, amounted to approximately
    $21 million as of April 3, 2010. The Company does not
    maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions,
    obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities
    that would be expected to have a material current or future
    effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

MARKET
    RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company is exposed to a variety of risks, including changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain
    anticipated cash flows from its international operations and
    possible declines in the fair value of reported net assets of
    certain of its foreign operations, as well as changes in the
    fair value of its fixed-rate debt relating to changes in
    interest rates. Consequently, in the normal course of business
    the Company employs established policies and



procedures, including the use of derivative financial
    instruments, to manage such risks. The Company does not enter
    into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is
    exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts
    will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only
    entering into contracts with carefully selected financial
    institutions based upon their credit ratings and other financial
    factors. The Company’s established policies and procedures
    for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include
    reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.
    As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not
    believe it is exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty
    risk with respect to its derivative contracts as of
    April 3, 2010.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

The Company manages its exposure to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange
    contracts. Refer to Note 16 to the audited consolidated
    financial statements for a summarization of the notional amounts
    and fair values of the Company’s foreign currency exchange
    contracts outstanding as of April 3, 2010.

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

From time to time, the Company may enter into forward foreign
    currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from
    exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany
    royalty payments made by certain of its international
    operations, intercompany contributions made to fund certain
    marketing efforts of its international operations, interest
    payments made in connection with outstanding debt, other foreign
    currency-denominated operational obligations including payroll,
    rent, insurance and benefit payments, and foreign
    currency-denominated revenues. As part of our overall strategy
    to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of
    the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British
    Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign
    currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve-month to
    two-year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency
    exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three
    months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout
    the hedging period.

The Company’s foreign exchange risk management activities
    are governed by policies and procedures approved by its Audit
    Committee. Our policies and procedures provide a framework that
    allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring
    the activities are conducted within established Company
    guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the
    organizational structure of our risk management function and for
    internal controls over foreign exchange risk management
    activities, including but not limited to authorization levels,
    transactional limits, and credit quality controls, as well as
    various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor
    foreign exchange risk using different techniques including a
    periodic review of market value and sensitivity analyses.

The Company records its foreign currency exchange contracts at
    fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. To the extent
    foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow
    hedges at hedge inception are highly effective in offsetting the
    change in the value of the hedged item, the related gains
    (losses) are deferred in equity as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. These deferred gains (losses) are
    then recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as
    follows:

•

Forecasted Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as
    part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of
    goods sold when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments

and

Marketing
    Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency
    gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Operational Obligations

— Recognized primarily
    within SG&A expenses in the period in which the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings.



•

Interest Payments on Euro Debt

— Recognized
    within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which
    the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency
    exchange remeasurement.

The Company recognized net gains on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in earnings of approximately $13 million for
    Fiscal 2010, and net losses of approximately $6 million for
    Fiscal 2009 and $8 million for Fiscal 2008.

Sensitivity

The Company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the
    effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values
    of the Company’s derivative financial instruments. To
    perform the sensitivity analysis, the Company assesses the risk
    of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like
    movement by all foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio
    against the U.S. dollar. Based on all foreign currency
    exchange contracts outstanding as of April 3, 2010, a 10%
    devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of
    foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as
    of April 3, 2010 would result in approximately
    $1 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10%
    appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in
    approximately $1 million of net unrealized gains. As the
    Company’s outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts
    are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted
    transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10%
    devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes
    in the underlying hedged items.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company designated the entire principal amount of its
    outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries. The changes in fair value
    of a derivative instrument or changes in a non-derivative
    financial instrument (such as debt) that is designated as a
    hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in
    the same manner as a translation adjustment, to the extent it is
    effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the Euro Debt
    resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and
    continue to be, reported in equity as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. The Company recorded within other
    comprehensive income the translation effects of the Euro Debt to
    U.S. dollars, resulting in a loss of $1.8 million for
    Fiscal 2010, a gain of $66.6 million for Fiscal 2009 and a
    loss of $73.8 million for Fiscal 2008.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

Sensitivity

As of April 3, 2010, the Company had no variable-rate debt
    outstanding. As such, the Company’s exposure to changes in
    interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate Euro Debt. As
    of April 3, 2010, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was
    $282.1 million and the fair value was $291.7 million.
    A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of
    interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the
    fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $2 million.
    Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain
    simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro currency
    exchange rates and an immediate

across-the-board

increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no
    other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.

Investment
    Risk Management

As of April 3, 2010, the Company had cash and cash
    equivalents on-hand of $563.1 million, primarily invested
    in money market funds, time deposits and treasury bills with
    original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company’s
    other significant investments included $584.1 million of
    short-term investments, primarily in treasury bills, municipal
    bonds, time deposits and variable rate municipal securities with
    original maturities greater than 90 days;
    $75.4 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with
    certain banks as collateral primarily to secure guarantees in
    connection with certain international tax matters;
    $67.8 million of deposits with maturities greater than one
    year; $2.3 million of auction rate securities issued
    through a municipality and $5.4 million of other securities.

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss
    positions for

other-than-temporary

impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a
    variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and



uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and
    distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors
    considered by the Company include (i) the length of time
    and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost,
    (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and
    near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time
    to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market
    forecasts, (v) the Company’s intent and ability to
    retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
    for recovery of market value, and (vi) an assessment of
    whether it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be
    required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 60,
    “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
    Accounting Policies” (“FRR 60”), suggests
    companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those
    accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers
    an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations and
    requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of
    management in its application. The Company’s estimates are
    often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions
    that management believes to be reasonable, but that are
    inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that
    other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same
    facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of
    alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the
    following list represents its critical accounting policies as
    contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the
    Company’s significant accounting policies, see Notes 3
    and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements.

Sales
    Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts

A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and
    net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that
    portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In
    particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including

e-commerce

sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns.

In determining estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes
    historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market
    conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to
    determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant
    judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation,
    including an analysis of specific risks on a

customer-by-customer

basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging
    analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has
    historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this
    information, management provides a reserve for the estimated
    amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management
    believes that it has adequately provided for those risks as part
    of its bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact
    on its major customers’ business operations could have a
    corresponding material adverse effect on the Company’s net
    sales, cash flows

and/or

financial condition.

See “Accounts Receivable” in Note 3 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an
    analysis of the activity in the Company’s sales reserves
    and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal
    years presented.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value with cost primarily
    determined on a weighted-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning product and fashion product.
    Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on
    an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company’s
    individual product lines, the impact of market trends and
    economic conditions, and the value of



current orders in-house relating to the future sales of
    inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to
    quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and
    retailer preferences and market conditions. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not
    differed materially from actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) topic 805, “Business Combinations”
    (“ASC 805”) (formerly referred to as Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations,” as amended, which replaces
    FAS No. 141). ASC 805 establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the
    goodwill acquired. Significant changes resulting from
    ASC 805 include the need for the acquirer to record 100% of
    all assets and liabilities of the acquired business, including
    goodwill, generally at fair value for all business combinations
    (whether partial, full or step acquisitions); the need to
    recognize contingent consideration at fair value on the
    acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, to recognize
    changes in fair value in earnings until settlement; and the need
    for acquisition- related transaction and restructuring costs to
    be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the
    acquisition. These fair value determinations require
    management’s judgment and may involve the use of
    significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions
    with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount
    rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. The
    Company adopted the provisions of ASC 805 as of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2010 (March 29, 2009). See Note 5 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of the effect of this accounting change on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In addition, in connection with its business acquisitions, the
    Company evaluates the terms of any pre-existing relationships to
    determine if a settlement of the pre-existing relationship
    exists. These pre-existing relationships primarily relate to
    licensing agreements. If the terms of the pre-existing
    relationships were determined to not be reflective of market, a
    settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings,
    measured by the amount in which the contract is favorable or
    unfavorable to the Company when compared with pricing for
    current market transactions for the same or similar items. The
    Company allocates the aggregate consideration exchanged in these
    transactions between the value of the business acquired and the
    value of the settlement of any pre-existing relationships in
    proportion to estimates of their respective fair values.
    Accordingly, significant judgment is required to determine the
    respective fair values of the business acquired and the value of
    the settlement of the pre-existing relationship. The Company may
    utilize independent valuation firms to assist in the
    determination of fair value.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued ASC topic 820, “Fair Value
    Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”)
    (formerly referred to as FAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” as amended). ASC 820 defines “fair
    value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date within an
    identified principal or most advantageous market, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP
    and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements
    through a three-level valuation hierarchy. The Company adopted
    the provisions of ASC 820 for all of its financial assets
    and liabilities within scope as of the beginning of Fiscal 2009
    (March 30, 2008). In addition, the Company adopted the
    provisions of ASC 820 for all of its nonfinancial assets
    and liabilities within scope as of the beginning of Fiscal 2010
    (March 29, 2009). The Company uses judgment in the
    determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy of a
    particular asset or liability when evaluating the inputs used in
    valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to
    which the inputs are market-based (observable) or internally
    derived (unobservable). See Notes 4 and 15 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of the effect of this accounting change on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



Impairment
    of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill, including any goodwill included in the carrying value
    of investments accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have
    indefinite useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and
    such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for
    impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their
    respective fair values to their carrying values. Finite-lived
    intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated
    useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify
    potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting
    unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including
    goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
    carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
    not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the
    impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
    goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of
    impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
    implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner
    as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
    That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to
    all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any
    unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had
    been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was
    the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first
    step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair
    value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit
    (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step
    of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and
    often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
    Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the
    fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
    impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such
    charge. To assist management in the process of determining
    goodwill impairment, the Company reviews and considers
    appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair
    value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows,
    market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use
    significant estimates and assumptions, including projected
    future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting
    the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates
    and determination of appropriate market comparables.

The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
    asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition,
    in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability,
    the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected
    to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. To
    the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
    attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between
    the carrying value of such asset and its fair value.

The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of
    goodwill during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010. Based on the
    results of the impairment assessment as of June 28, 2009,
    the Company confirmed that the fair value of its reporting units
    exceeded their respective carrying values and that there were no
    reporting units that were at risk of impairment. Additionally,
    there have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with
    the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill or other
    intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented.

Impairment
    of Other Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
    recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future
    cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
    eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future
    undiscounted net



cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying
    amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference
    between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value.
    Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan
    of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair
    value less costs to sell.

In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various
    factors into account, including changes in merchandising
    strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the
    effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and
    the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and
    increased local advertising. Since the determination of future
    cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be
    future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not
    meet expectations.

During Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, the Company
    recorded non-cash impairment charges of $6.6 million,
    $55.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, to
    reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets
    primarily in its Retail segment to their estimated fair value.
    See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax
    expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in
    the current year and include the results of any difference
    between US GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect
    the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and
    general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of
    temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and
    liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as
    determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company
    accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or
    rates in the period of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when
    management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some
    portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

In determining the income tax provision for financial reporting
    purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax
    positions. If the Company considers that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
    recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit
    by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and
    the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To
    the extent that the Company’s estimates change or the final
    tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts
    recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision
    in the period in which such determinations are made. If the
    initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax
    benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and
    subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are
    changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise
    the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the
    position to more-likely-than-not, (ii) the statute of
    limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an
    audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the
    appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as
    current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the
    next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded
    within the provision for income taxes in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the
    consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the
    Company’s income taxes.

Contingencies

The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in
    the ordinary course of conducting its business, including
    certain litigations, alleged information system security breach
    matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters,
    various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property
    matters and disputes. The Company records a liability for such
    contingencies to the extent that it concludes their occurrence
    is probable and



the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is
    reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a
    contingency could exceed the established liability, the Company
    discloses the estimated impact on its liquidity, financial
    condition and results of operations. Management considers many
    factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution
    of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments
    can involve a series of complex judgments about future events
    including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations
    between affected parties and governmental actions. As a result,
    the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on
    estimates and assumptions.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company expenses all share-based payments to employees and
    non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the
    awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated
    forfeitures.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which
    requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key
    assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key
    factors influencing the estimation process include the expected
    term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor,
    the expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate, among
    others. Generally, once stock option values are determined,
    current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed,
    even if the estimates used are different from the actuals.

Determining the fair value of stock-based compensation at the
    date of grant requires significant judgment by management,
    including estimates of the above Black-Scholes assumptions. In
    addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of
    stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual
    results differ significantly from these estimates, if management
    changes its assumptions for future stock-based award grants, or
    if there are changes in market conditions, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based RSUs to certain of its senior executives
    and non-employee directors. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to such senior executives and other key
    executives, and certain other employees of the Company. The fair
    values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair
    value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to
    reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities
    that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation
    expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the
    related service period when attainment of the performance goals
    is deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of
    management.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other
    procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
    issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time period specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
    Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that material
    information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
    that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s
    management, including its principal executive and principal
    financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal
    year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation,
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as
    of the fiscal year end covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

(b) Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in Securities Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and preparation of financial statements for external
    purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    for preparation of our financial statements; providing
    reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company’s assets are made in accordance with management
    authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our
    financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely
    basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
    over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute
    assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would
    be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was
    made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in
    future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on
    the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation,
    management concluded that the Company’s internal controls
    over financial reporting were effective at the reasonable
    assurance level as of the fiscal year end covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company acquired
    control of the Polo-branded apparel business in Asia-Pacific
    (excluding Japan) from Dickson that was formerly conducted under
    a licensed arrangement (the “Asia-Pacific Licensed
    Operations Acquisition,” as discussed in Note 5 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). The
    Company is in the process of evaluating Dickson’s internal
    controls. However, as permitted by related SEC Staff
    interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, the Company
    excluded Dickson from management’s annual assessment of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over



financial reporting as of April 3, 2010. In the aggregate,
    Dickson represented 2.8% of the total consolidated assets and
    0.6% of total consolidated revenues of the Company as of and for
    the fiscal year ended April 3, 2010.

Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as included elsewhere herein.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
    Reporting

Except as discussed below, there has been no change in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition

In connection with the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition, the Company has developed a supporting
    infrastructure covering all critical operations, including but
    not limited to, merchandising, sales, inventory management,
    customer service, distribution, store operations, real estate
    management, finance and other administrative areas. As part of
    the development of this infrastructure, the Company has
    implemented various processes, systems, and internal controls to
    support the business.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Description
    of Business

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (“PRLC”) is a global
    leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium
    lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s and
    children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. PRLC’s long-standing reputation and
    distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    PRLC’s brand names include

Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph
    Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Women’s Collection, Black
    Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby,
    Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, American Living, Chaps

and

Club Monaco

, among others. PRLC and its subsidiaries are
    collectively referred to herein as the “Company,”
    “we,” “us,” “our” and
    “ourselves,” unless the context indicates otherwise.

The Company classifies its businesses into three segments:
    Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. The Company’s wholesale
    sales are made principally to major department and specialty
    stores located throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Company
    also sells directly to consumers through full-price and factory
    retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South
    America and Asia, through concessions-based shop-within-shops
    located primarily in Asia, and through its retail internet sites
    located at www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com. In addition,
    the Company often licenses the right to unrelated third parties
    to use its various trademarks in connection with the manufacture
    and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and
    fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified
    periods.

2.

Basis of
    Presentation

Basis
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements present the financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company
    and all entities in which the Company has a controlling voting
    interest. The consolidated financial statements also include the
    accounts of any variable interest entities in which the Company
    is considered to be the primary beneficiary and such entities
    are required to be consolidated in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“US
    GAAP”).

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company utilizes a

52-53 week

fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As
    such, fiscal year 2010 ended on April 3, 2010 and reflected
    a 53-week period (“Fiscal 2010”); fiscal year 2009
    ended on March 28, 2009 and reflected a 52-week period
    (“Fiscal 2009”); and fiscal year 2008 ended on
    March 29, 2008 and also reflected a 52-week period
    (“Fiscal 2008”). The inclusion of the

rd

week

    in Fiscal 2010 resulted in incremental revenues of approximately
    $70 million and increased net income of approximately
    $13 million.

In April 2009, the Company performed an internal legal entity
    reorganization of certain of its wholly owned Japan
    subsidiaries. As a result of the reorganization, the
    Company’s former Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation and
    Impact 21 Co., Ltd. subsidiaries were merged into a new wholly
    owned subsidiary named Polo Ralph Lauren Kabushiki Kaisha
    (“PRL KK”). The financial position and operating
    results of the Company’s consolidated PRL KK entity are
    reported on a one-month lag. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operating results for Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008
    include the operating results of PRL KK for the twelve-month
    periods ended February 28, 2010, February 28, 2009 and
    February 29, 2008, respectively. The net effect of this
    reporting lag is not material to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

F-6


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements include reserves for customer
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks; the realizability of
    inventory; reserves for litigation and other contingencies;
    useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and
    intangible assets; accounting for income taxes and related
    uncertain tax positions; the valuation of stock-based
    compensation and related expected forfeiture rates; reserves for
    restructuring; and accounting for business combinations.

Reclassifications

On December 31, 2009, the Company acquired certain assets
    from Dickson Concepts International Limited
    (“Dickson”), its former licensee of Polo-branded
    apparel in Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan), and assumed direct
    control of its business in that region (the “Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition”). Dickson formerly
    conducted the Company’s business in Asia-Pacific (excluding
    Japan) through a combination of freestanding owned stores,
    freestanding licensed stores and shop-within-shops at department
    stores or malls. The terms of trade for shop-within-shops were
    largely conducted on a concessions basis, whereby inventory
    continued to be owned by the Company (not the department store)
    until ultimate sale to the end consumer and the salespeople
    involved in the sales transaction were employees of the Company.
    As management believes that this concessions-based sales model
    possesses more attributes of a retail model than a wholesale
    model, it was determined that all concessions-based sales
    arrangements (including those conducted in Japan) should be
    classified within the Company’s Retail segment, in contrast
    to the historical classification within its Wholesale segment.
    Accordingly, effective with the closing of the Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition at the beginning of the fourth
    quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company restated its segment
    presentation to reclassify concessions-based sales arrangements
    to its Retail segment from its Wholesale segment. There have
    been no changes in total revenue, total operating income or
    total assets as a result of this change. Segment information for
    Fiscal 2009 has been recast to conform to the current
    period’s presentation. In periods prior to Fiscal 2009,
    segment information has not been recast to conform to the
    current period’s presentation, as it is impracticable to do
    so. See Note 22 for further discussion of the
    Company’s segment information.

Certain other reclassifications have been made to the prior
    years’ financial information in order to conform to the
    current year’s presentation, including to reflect the
    adoption of recent accounting guidance related to noncontrolling
    interests.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when
    there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has
    occurred, price has been fixed or is determinable, and
    collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenue within the Company’s Wholesale segment is
    recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of
    estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns, operational chargebacks and certain cooperative
    advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require
    pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade
    terms. Estimates for

end-of-season

markdown reserves are based on historical trends, seasonal
    results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions
    and retailer performance. Estimates for operational chargebacks
    are based on actual notifications of order fulfillment
    discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Retail store and concessions-based shop-within-shop revenue is
    recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to
    consumers.

E-commerce

revenue from sales of products ordered through the
    Company’s retail internet sites at RalphLauren.com and
    Rugby.com is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the
    shipment by its customers. Such revenue also is reduced by an
    estimate of returns.

Gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability
    until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
    The Company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the
    likelihood of a gift card being

F-7


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

redeemed by a customer is remote and the Company determines that
    it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the
    unredeemed gift card to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed
    or abandoned property.

Revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized when earned in
    accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements,
    generally based upon the higher of (a) contractually
    guaranteed minimum royalty levels or (b) actual sales and
    royalty data, or estimates thereof, received from the
    Company’s licensees.

The Company accounts for sales and other related taxes on a net
    basis, excluding such taxes from revenue.

Cost
    of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and
    produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in
    and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage
    and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with
    foreign currency exchange contracts related to the hedging of
    inventory purchases also are recognized within cost of goods
    sold when the inventory being hedged is sold. The costs of
    selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing
    the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing
    and order charges, are included in selling, general and
    administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

The costs associated with shipping goods to customers are
    reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling
    costs incurred approximated $83 million in Fiscal 2010,
    $95 million in Fiscal 2009 and $108 million in Fiscal
    2008. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are
    included in revenue.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising,
    are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Costs of

out-of-store

advertising paid to wholesale customers under cooperative
    advertising programs are expensed as an advertising cost if both
    the identified advertising benefit is sufficiently separable
    from the purchase of the Company’s products by customers
    and the fair value of such benefit is measurable. Otherwise,
    such costs are reflected as a reduction of revenue. Costs of
    in-store advertising paid to wholesale customers under
    cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising
    costs, but are reflected as a reduction of revenues since the
    benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of
    the Company’s products by customers.

Advertising expense amounted to approximately $157 million
    for Fiscal 2010, $171 million for Fiscal 2009 and
    $188 million for Fiscal 2008. Deferred advertising costs,
    which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet
    been exhibited or services that have not yet been received, were
    approximately $4 million and $6 million at the end of
    Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and operating results of foreign
    operations are primarily consolidated using the local currency
    as the functional currency. Local currency assets and
    liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the
    balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are
    translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
    Resulting translation gains or losses are included in the
    consolidated statements of equity as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on
    translation of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries of a
    long-term investment nature also are included within this
    component of equity.

The Company also recognizes gains and losses on transactions
    that are denominated in a currency other than the respective
    entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses also include amounts realized on the settlement
    of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are either
    of a short-term investment nature or were previously of a
    long-term investment nature and deferred as a component of
    equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
    recognized in earnings and separately disclosed in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the
    consolidated statements of equity, consists of net income (loss)
    and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under US GAAP,
    are excluded from net income (loss). The components of other
    comprehensive income (loss) for the Company primarily consist of
    foreign currency translation gains and losses; unrealized gains
    and losses on

available-for-sale

investments; unrealized gains and losses related to the
    accounting for defined benefit plans; and deferred gains and
    losses on hedging instruments, such as forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and foreign
    currency gains (losses) on the Company’s Euro-denominated
    debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain of
    its European subsidiaries.

Net
    Income Per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing the
    net income applicable to common shares after preferred dividend
    requirements, if any, by the weighted-average number of common
    shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common
    shares include shares of the Company’s Class A and
    Class B common stock. Diluted net income per common share
    adjusts basic net income per common share for the effects of
    outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and any other potentially dilutive financial instruments,
    only in the periods in which such effect is dilutive under the
    treasury stock method.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to
    calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to
    those shares used in calculating diluted net income per common
    share as follows:

Options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
    greater than the average market price of the common stock during
    the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not
    included in the computation of diluted net income per common
    share. In addition, the Company has outstanding restricted stock
    units that are issuable only upon the achievement of certain
    service

and/or

performance goals. Such performance-based restricted stock units
    are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the
    extent the underlying performance conditions (a) are
    satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or
    (b) would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period
    were the end of the related contingency period and the result
    would be dilutive under the treasury stock method. As of the end
    of Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, there was an
    aggregate of approximately 1.2 million, 3.5 million
    and 1.5 million, respectively, of additional shares
    issuable upon the exercise of anti-dilutive options and the
    contingent vesting of restricted stock and performance-based
    restricted stock units that were excluded from the diluted share
    calculations.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company expenses all share-based payments to employees and
    non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the
    awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated
    forfeitures. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation method
    to determine the grant date fair value of its stock option
    awards.

See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of 90 days or less, including
    investments in debt securities. Investments in debt securities
    are diversified among high-credit quality securities in
    accordance with the Company’s risk-management policies, and
    primarily include commercial paper and money market funds.

Restricted
    Cash

From time to time, the Company is required to place cash in
    escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure
    guarantees of corresponding amounts made by the banks to
    international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as
    to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain
    international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain
    international tax audits. Such cash has been classified as
    restricted cash and reported as a component of either other
    current assets or non-current assets in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets.

Short-term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company
    expects to convert into cash within one year, including time
    deposits which have a maturity greater than three months.
    Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are
    reported at fair value. Short-term investments classified as
    held-to-maturity are reported at cost, which approximates market
    value. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and
    purchase of short-term investments are classified as investing
    activities within the Company’s consolidated statements of
    cash flows.

Accounts
    Receivable

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to
    customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts
    receivable, net, as shown in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets, is net of certain reserves and allowances. These
    reserves and allowances consist of (a) reserves for
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks and (b) allowances
    for doubtful accounts. These reserves and allowances are
    discussed in further detail below.

A reserve for sales returns is determined based on an evaluation
    of current market conditions and historical returns experience.
    Charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

A reserve for trade discounts is determined based on open
    invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers,
    and charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

Estimated

end-of-season

markdown charges are included as reductions of revenue. The
    related markdown provisions are based on retail sales
    performance, seasonal negotiations with customers, historical
    deduction trends and an evaluation of current market conditions.

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
    deductions by customers relating to individual shipments.
    Charges to increase this reserve, net of expected recoveries,
    are included as reductions of revenue. The reserve is based on
    actual notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and past
    experience.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major
    department and specialty stores across the U.S., Canada, Europe
    and Asia and extends credit based on an evaluation of each
    customer’s financial capacity and condition, usually
    without requiring collateral. In its wholesale business,
    concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the
    large number of customers and their dispersion across many
    geographic areas. However, the Company has five key
    department-store customers that generate significant sales
    volume. For Fiscal 2010, these customers in the aggregate
    contributed approximately 45% of all wholesale revenues.
    Further, as of April 3, 2010, the Company’s five key
    department-store customers represented approximately 30% of
    gross accounts receivable.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value with cost primarily
    determined on a weighted-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning product and all fashion
    product. Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined
    based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the
    Company’s individual product lines, the impact of market
    trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders
    in-house relating to future sales of inventory. Estimates may
    differ from actual results due to quantity,

F-11


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer
    preferences and market conditions. The Company’s historical
    estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed
    materially from actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.

Investments

Investments in companies in which the Company has significant
    influence, but less than a controlling voting interest, are
    accounted for using the equity method. This is generally
    presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of
    the investee. However, as a matter of policy, if the Company had
    a greater than 50% ownership interest in an investee and the
    noncontrolling shareholders held certain rights that allowed
    them to participate in the

day-to-day

operations of the business, the Company would also generally use
    the equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, only the Company’s investment in
    and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in
    the consolidated balance sheets; only the Company’s share
    of the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in the
    consolidated operating results; and only the dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the investee
    and additional cash investments, loan repayments or other cash
    paid to the investee are included in the consolidated cash flows.

Investments in companies in which the Company does not have a
    controlling interest, or is unable to exert significant
    influence, are accounted for as

available-for-sale

investments and, if the investments are publicly traded and
    there are no resale restrictions greater than one year, recorded
    at fair value. If resale restrictions greater than one year
    exist, or if the investment is not publicly traded, the
    investment is accounted for at cost.

Investments in debt securities are recorded at cost, adjusted
    for the amortization of premiums and discounts, which
    approximates fair value. Investments in debt securities that the
    Company has the intent and ability to retain until maturity are
    classified as

held-to-maturity.

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss
    positions for

other-than-temporary

impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a
    variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and
    uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and
    distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors
    considered by the Company include (i) the length of time
    and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost,
    (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and
    near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time
    to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market
    forecasts, (v) the Company’s intent and ability to
    retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
    for recovery of market value, and (vi) an assessment of
    whether it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be
    required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.
    The Company has not recognized any significant

other-than-temporary

impairment charges in any of the fiscal years presented.

Equity-method
    Investments

The Company’s investments include a joint venture named the
    Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL
    Watch Company”), formed with Financiere Richemont SA
    (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group, in March
    2007. The joint venture is a Swiss corporation, whose purpose is
    to design, develop, manufacture, sell and distribute luxury
    watches and fine jewelry through Ralph Lauren boutiques, as well
    as through fine independent jewelry and luxury watch retailers
    throughout the world. The Company accounts for its 50% interest
    in the RL Watch Company under the equity method of accounting,
    and such investment is classified in other non-current assets in
    the consolidated balance sheets. Royalty payments due to the
    Company under the related license agreement for use of certain
    of the Company’s trademarks are reflected as licensing
    revenue within the consolidated statements of operations.

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture,
    fixtures, computer software and computer equipment; from three
    to ten years for machinery and equipment; and from ten to forty
    years for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are
    depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
    the respective assets or the life of the lease.

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
    recoverability, including finite-lived intangibles as described
    below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted
    net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the
    carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the
    difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair
    value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a
    committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying
    value or fair value less costs to sell.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value
    of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consist of
    license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete
    agreements and order backlog. The fair value of these intangible
    assets is estimated based on management’s assessment,
    considering independent third party appraisals, when necessary.
    The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of
    net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill, including
    any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain
    other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives
    are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually
    based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their
    carrying values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized
    over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with
    other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for
    impairment periodically whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may
    not be recoverable. See discussion of the Company’s
    accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as described
    earlier under the caption

“Property and Equipment,
    Net.”

Officers’
    Life Insurance Policies

The Company maintains certain split-dollar life insurance
    policies for select senior executives. These policies are
    recorded at the lesser of their cash-surrender value or
    aggregate premiums

paid-to-date

in the consolidated balance sheets. As of the end of both Fiscal
    2010 and Fiscal 2009, amounts of approximately $33 million
    relating to officers’ split-dollar life insurance policies
    held by the Company were classified within other non-current
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

In May 2009, the Company liquidated all of its whole-life
    insurance policies held at cash-surrender value. As of the end
    of Fiscal 2009, the related asset balance of approximately
    $16 million was classified within short-term investments in
    the consolidated balance sheet.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax
    expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in
    the current year and include the results of any difference
    between US GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect
    the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and
    general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of
    temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and

F-13


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as
    determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company
    accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or
    rates in the period of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when
    management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some
    portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

In determining the income tax provision for financial reporting
    purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax
    positions. If the Company considers that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
    recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit
    by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains
    assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the
    Company’s estimates change or the final tax outcome of
    these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such
    differences will impact the income tax provision in the period
    in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment
    fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company
    regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the
    tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or
    analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of
    prevailing on the technical merits of the position to
    “more-likely-than-not,” (ii) the statute of
    limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an
    audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the
    appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as
    current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the
    next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded
    within the provision for income taxes in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the
    consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company’s
    income taxes.

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment, including
    its retail stores. Certain of the Company’s leases contain
    renewal options, rent escalation clauses

and/or

landlord incentives. Rent expense for noncancelable operating
    leases with scheduled rent increases

and/or

landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement
    date. The excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled
    payment amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a
    deferred rent liability. As of the end of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal
    2009, deferred rent obligations of approximately
    $148 million and $137 million, respectively, were
    classified within other non-current liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

In certain lease arrangements the Company is involved with the
    construction of the building (generally on land owned by the
    landlord). If the Company concludes that it has substantively
    all of the risks of ownership during construction of a leased
    property and therefore is deemed the owner of the project for
    accounting purposes, it records an asset and related financing
    obligation for the amount of total project costs related to

construction-in-progress

and the pre-existing building. Once construction is complete,
    the Company considers the requirements for sale-leaseback
    treatment, including the transfer back of all risks of ownership
    and whether the Company has any continuing involvement in the
    leased property. If the arrangement does not qualify for
    sale-leaseback treatment, the Company continues to amortize the
    financing obligation and depreciate the building over the lease
    term.

Financial
    Instruments (including Derivatives)

The Company records all derivative instruments on the balance
    sheet at fair value. In addition, for derivative instruments
    that qualify for hedge accounting, the effective portion of
    changes in the fair value is either (a) offset against the
    changes in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
    commitments through earnings or (b) recognized in equity as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the
    hedged item is

F-14


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recognized in earnings, depending on whether the derivative is
    being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash flows,
    respectively.

Each derivative instrument entered into by the Company which
    qualifies for hedge accounting is considered highly effective at
    reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. For
    each derivative designated as a hedge, the Company formally
    documents the risk management objective and strategy, including
    the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item
    and the risk exposure, as well as how effectiveness is to be
    assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess
    effectiveness, the Company uses non-statistical methods,
    including the dollar-offset method, which compare the change in
    the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value
    or cash flows of the hedged item. The extent to which a hedging
    instrument has been and is expected to continue to be effective
    at achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is
    assessed and documented by the Company at least on a quarterly
    basis. To the extent that a derivative contract designated as a
    hedge is not considered to be effective, any changes in fair
    value relating to the ineffective portion is immediately
    recognized in earnings within foreign currency gains (losses).
    If it is determined that a derivative has not been highly
    effective, and will continue not to be highly effective at
    hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is
    discontinued. If a hedge relationship is terminated, the change
    in fair value of the derivative previously recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive income is realized when the
    hedged item affects earnings consistent with the original
    hedging strategy, unless the forecasted transaction is no longer
    probable of occurring in which case the accumulated amount is
    immediately recognized in earnings.

The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for
    speculative or trading purposes. All undesignated hedges of the
    Company are entered into to hedge specific economic risks, such
    as foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk. Changes in
    fair value relating to undesignated derivative instruments are
    immediately recognized in earnings.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is
    exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts
    will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only
    entering into contracts with carefully selected financial
    institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other
    financial factors, adhering to established limits for credit
    exposure. The Company’s established policies and procedures
    for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include
    continually reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of
    counterparties.

For cash flow reporting purposes, the Company classifies
    proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a
    derivative instrument in the same manner as the related item
    being hedged.

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments
    approximates fair value, except for certain differences relating
    to fixed-rate debt, investments in other entities accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting and certain other
    financial instruments. However, other than differences in the
    fair value of fixed-rate debt as disclosed in Note 14,
    these differences were not significant as of April 3, 2010
    or March 28, 2009. The fair value of financial instruments
    generally is determined by reference to fair market values
    resulting from the trading of the instruments on a national
    securities exchange or an

over-the-counter

market. In cases where quoted market prices are not available,
    fair value is based on estimates derived through the use of
    present value or other valuation techniques.

See Note 16 for further discussion of the Company’s
    financial instruments, including derivatives.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued revised guidance for accounting for a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”) (formerly referred to
    as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”)
    No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation
    No. 46(R)”), which has been codified within Accounting
    Standards Codification (“ASC”) topic 810,
    “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”). The revised
    guidance within ASC 810 changes the

F-15


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE,
    replacing the quantitative-based risks and rewards approach with
    a qualitative approach that focuses on identifying which
    enterprise has (i) the power to direct the activities of a
    VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the
    right to receive benefits of the entity that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. ASC 810 also now requires
    ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE, as well as additional disclosures about an
    enterprise’s involvement in VIEs. The revised accounting
    guidance within ASC 810 is effective for the Company as of
    the beginning of fiscal year 2011 and its adoption is not
    expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC topic 820, “Fair
    Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”)
    (formerly referred to as FAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” as amended). ASC 820 defines “fair
    value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date within an
    identified principal or most advantageous market, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP
    and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. The
    Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820 for all of its
    financial assets and liabilities within scope as of the
    beginning of Fiscal 2009 (March 30, 2008). In addition, the
    Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820 for all of its
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities within scope as of the
    beginning of Fiscal 2010 (March 29, 2009). The adoption of
    the provisions of ASC 820 did not have a significant impact
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See
    Note 15 for further discussion of the impact of adoption on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Business
    Combinations and Noncontrolling Interests

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC topic 805, “Business
    Combinations” (“ASC 805”) (formerly referred to
    as FAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations,”
    as amended, which replaces FAS No. 141). ASC 805 was
    issued to create greater consistency in the accounting and
    financial reporting of business combinations, resulting in more
    complete, comparable and relevant information for investors and
    other users of financial statements. ASC 805 establishes
    principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business
    combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the
    goodwill acquired. Significant changes resulting from
    ASC 805 include the need for the acquirer to record 100% of
    all assets and liabilities of the acquired business, including
    goodwill, generally at fair value for all business combinations
    (whether partial, full or step acquisitions); the need to
    recognize contingent consideration at fair value on the
    acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, to recognize
    changes in fair value in earnings until settlement; and the need
    for acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs to
    be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the
    acquisition. ASC 805 also establishes disclosure
    requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination. The Company
    adopted the provisions of ASC 805 as of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2010 (March 29, 2009). The adoption of the
    provisions of ASC 805 did not have a significant impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See
    Note 5 for further discussion of the business combination
    entered into by the Company during Fiscal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance for
    accounting for noncontrolling interests (formerly referred to as
    FAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an Amendment of
    ARB No. 51”), which has been codified within
    ASC 810. The revised guidance within ASC 810
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for
    noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary (previously referred to
    as “minority interests”) and for the deconsolidation
    of a subsidiary, to ensure consistency with the requirements of
    ASC 805. ASC 810 states that noncontrolling
    interests should be classified as a separate component of
    equity, and establishes reporting requirements that provide
    sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish
    between the interests of the parent and the interests of the
    noncontrolling owners. The Company adopted the revised
    accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests within
    ASC 810 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2010 (March 29,
    2009). The new guidance

F-16

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

is being applied prospectively, except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements, which have been applied
    retrospectively. The adoption did not have a significant impact
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, but
    could impact the accounting for future acquisitions in which the
    Company does not acquire 100% of an entity, the future
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary and a future change in the
    Company’s ownership percentage of a subsidiary.

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued revised guidance for the
    accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions (formerly
    referred to as FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of
    FAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”)), which
    has been codified within ASC topic 740, “Income Taxes”
    (“ASC 740”). The revised guidance within ASC 740
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    Additionally, it provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the
    revised accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes
    within ASC 740 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008 and
    recorded a related $62.5 million reduction in retained
    earnings as the cumulative effect to adjust its net liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits as of April 1, 2007. This
    adjustment consisted of a $99.9 million increase to the
    Company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, offset
    in part by a $37.4 million increase to the Company’s
    deferred tax assets principally representing the value of future
    tax benefits that could be realized at the U.S. federal
    level if the related liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
    at the state and local levels ultimately are required to be
    settled. See Note 13 for further discussion of the
    Company’s income taxes.

Fiscal
    2010 Transactions

Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition

On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel business in Asia-Pacific (excluding
    Japan) from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets from Dickson in exchange for an
    initial payment of approximately $20 million and other
    consideration of approximately $17 million (the
    “Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition”).
    Dickson was the Company’s licensee for Polo-branded apparel
    in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), which is comprised
    of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
    Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. The Company funded the
    Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash
    on-hand.

The Company accounted for the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition as a business combination during the fourth quarter
    of Fiscal 2010. The acquisition cost of $37 million
    (excluding transaction costs) has been allocated on a
    preliminary basis to the net assets acquired based on their
    respective fair values as follows: inventory of $2 million;
    customer relationship intangible asset of $29 million;
    tax-deductible goodwill of $1 million and other net assets
    of $5 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the
    purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs of
    $4 million were expensed as incurred and classified within
    SG&A expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

The customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the
    excess earnings method. This approach discounts the estimated
    after tax cash flows associated with the existing base of
    customers as of the acquisition date, factoring in expected
    attrition of the existing customer base. The customer
    relationship intangible asset is being amortized over its
    estimated useful life of ten years.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded apparel business
    in Asia-Pacific have been consolidated in the Company’s
    results of operations commencing January 1, 2010.

Fiscal
    2009 Transactions

Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition

On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the
    Polo-branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan
    from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai
    Co. Ltd. (“Naigai”) in exchange for a payment of
    approximately ¥2.8 billion (approximately
    $26 million as of the acquisition date) and certain other
    consideration (the “Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition”). The Company funded the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on-hand.
    Naigai was the Company’s licensee for childrenswear, golf
    apparel and hosiery under the Polo by Ralph Lauren and
    Ralph Lauren brands in Japan. In conjunction with the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, the Company also entered
    into an additional

5-year

licensing and design-related agreement with Naigai for Polo and
    Chaps-branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services
    agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human
    resources and information systems-related services over a period
    of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the
    transaction.

The Company accounted for the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition as an asset purchase during the second quarter of
    Fiscal 2009. Based on the results of valuation analyses
    performed, the Company allocated all of the consideration
    exchanged in the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition to
    the net assets acquired in connection with the transaction. No
    settlement loss associated with any pre-existing relationships
    was recognized. The acquisition cost of $28 million
    (including transaction costs of approximately $2 million)
    has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on their
    respective fair values as follows: inventory of
    $16 million; customer relationship intangible asset of
    $13 million; and other net liabilities of $1 million.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded childrenswear and
    golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the
    Company’s results of operations commencing August 2,
    2008.

Fiscal
    2008 Transactions

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company acquired control of certain of
    its Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under
    licensed arrangements, consistent with the Company’s
    long-term strategy of international expansion. In particular,
    the Company acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares
    of Impact 21 that it did not previously own in a cash tender
    offer (the “Impact 21 Acquisition”), thereby
    increasing its ownership in Impact 21 from approximately 20% to
    approximately 97%. Impact 21 previously conducted the
    Company’s men’s, women’s and jeans apparel and
    accessories business in Japan under a pre-existing,

sub-license

arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in PRL Japan, which holds the master license to conduct
    Polo’s business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu
    (the “PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition”).
    Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan
    Minority Interest Acquisition are herein referred to as the
    “Japanese Business Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately
    $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately
    $12 million. In February 2008, the Company acquired
    approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares
    outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. During the
    first quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company acquired the remaining
    2% of Impact 21 shares outstanding at an aggregate cost of
    approximately $9 million and completed the process of
    acquiring the remaining outstanding shares not exchanged as of
    the close of the tender offer period (the “minority
    squeeze-out”). As a result of these transactions, Impact 21
    is a 100%-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and ¥20.5 billion of borrowings
    under a one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment
    and restatement to the Company’s

F-18


POLO

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

existing credit facility. The Company repaid the borrowing by
    its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million
    of Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as part of the
    acquisition.

Based on the results of valuation analyses performed, the
    Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    purchase of the Japanese businesses. The acquisition cost of
    approximately $374 million has been allocated to the net
    assets acquired based on their respective fair values as
    follows: cash of $189 million; trade receivables of
    $26 million; inventory of $38 million; finite-lived
    intangible assets of $75 million (consisting of the
    re-acquired licenses of $21 million and customer
    relationships of $54 million); non-tax-deductible goodwill
    of $140 million; assumed pension liabilities of
    $5 million; net deferred tax liabilities of
    $31 million; and other net liabilities of $58 million.

The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company
    presented the amount of Impact 21’s net income allocable to
    the holders of the approximate 80% of the Impact 21 shares
    not owned by the Company prior to the closing date of the tender
    offer within net income attributable to noncontrolling interest
    in the consolidated statement of operations. The results of
    operations for PRL Japan had already been consolidated by the
    Company in all prior periods.

Acquisition
    of Small Leathergoods Business

On April 13, 2007, the Company acquired from Kellwood
    Company (“Kellwood”) substantially all of the assets
    of New Campaign, Inc., the Company’s licensee for
    men’s and women’s belts and other small leather goods
    under the

Ralph Lauren

,

Lauren

and

Chaps

brands in the U.S. (the “Small Leathergoods
    Business Acquisition”). The assets acquired from Kellwood
    are operated under the name of “Polo Ralph Lauren
    Leathergoods” and allowed the Company to further expand its
    accessories business. The acquisition cost was
    $10.4 million.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. As such, the
    Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition and no settlement gain
    or loss was recognized in connection with the transaction. The
    results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods
    business have been consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing April 1, 2007. In addition, the
    acquisition cost has been allocated as follows: inventory of
    $7.0 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
    $2.1 million (consisting of the re-acquired license of
    $1.3 million, customer relationships of $0.7 million
    and order backlog of $0.1 million); other net assets of
    $0.7 million; and tax-deductible goodwill of
    $0.6 million.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 3, goodwill and certain other
    intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not
    amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Finite-lived
    intangible assets continue to be amortized over their respective
    estimated useful lives. Based on the results of the
    Company’s annual impairment testing of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets in Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009
    and Fiscal 2008, no impairment charges were deemed necessary.

Impairments
    of Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
    recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future
    cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
    eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future
    undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less
    than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal
    to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and
    its fair value.

Fiscal
    2010 Impairment

During Fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment
    charge of $6.6 million to reduce the net carrying value of
    certain long-lived assets primarily in its Retail segment to
    their estimated fair value, which was determined based on
    discounted expected cash flows. This impairment charge was
    primarily related to the

lower-than-expected

operating performance of certain retail stores, largely related
    to the Company’s Club Monaco retail business.

Fiscal
    2009 Impairment

During Fiscal 2009, the Company recorded total non-cash
    impairment charges of $55.4 million to reduce the net
    carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated
    fair value, which was determined based on discounted expected
    cash flows. These impairment charges included a
    $52.0 million write-down of Retail store assets and a
    $3.4 million write-down of certain capitalized software
    costs (primarily in the Wholesale segment) that were determined
    to no longer be used over the intended service period. The
    Retail store asset impairment was associated with

lower-than-expected

operating performance for the fiscal year for certain

and

full-price
    stores primarily located in the U.S. due in part to the
    significant contraction in consumer spending experienced during
    the latter half of the fiscal year and which is expected to
    continue to negatively impact such stores’ future operating
    performance.

Fiscal
    2008 Impairment

During Fiscal 2008, the Company recorded non-cash impairment
    charges of $5.0 million to reduce the carrying value of
    certain long-lived assets in its Retail segment to their
    estimated fair value. These impairment charges were primarily
    recorded as a result of

lower-than-expected

operating cash flow performance for certain stores that, along
    with projections of future performance, indicated that the
    carrying values of the related fixed assets were not recoverable.

12.

Restructuring

The Company has recorded restructuring liabilities in recent
    years relating to various cost-savings initiatives, as well as
    certain of its acquisitions. Through Fiscal 2009, in accordance
    with then applicable US GAAP, restructuring costs incurred in
    connection with acquisitions were capitalized as part of the
    purchase accounting for the transaction. As of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2010, restructuring costs incurred in connection with
    acquisitions that are not obligations of the acquiree as of the
    acquisition date are expensed. Such acquisition-related
    restructuring costs were not material in any period. Liabilities
    for costs associated with non-acquisition-related restructuring
    initiatives are expensed and initially measured at fair value
    when incurred. A description of the nature of significant
    non-acquisition-related restructuring activities and related
    costs is presented below.

Fiscal
    2010 Restructuring

During Fiscal 2010, the Company recognized $6.9 million of
    net restructuring charges primarily related to employee
    termination costs, as well as the write-down of an asset
    associated with exiting a retail store in Japan.

Fiscal
    2009 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company initiated
    a restructuring plan designed to better align its cost base with
    the slowdown in consumer spending that has been negatively
    affecting sales and operating margins and to improve overall
    operating effectiveness (the “Fiscal 2009 Restructuring
    Plan”). The Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan included the
    termination of approximately 500 employees and the closure
    of certain underperforming retail stores.

In connection with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, the
    Company recorded $20.8 million in restructuring charges
    during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009. A summary of the
    activity in the related liability is as follows:

    expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet.

(b)

Net non-current deferred tax
    balances as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 were
    comprised of non-current deferred tax assets of
    $101.9 million and $102.8 million, respectively,
    included within deferred tax assets, and non-current deferred
    tax liabilities of $30.5 million and $22.6 million,
    respectively, included within other non-current liabilities in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has available state and foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards of $6.3 million and $27.5 million,
    respectively, for tax purposes to offset future taxable income.
    The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal
    2011.

Also, the Company has available state and foreign net operating
    loss carryforwards of $4.2 million and $66.0 million,
    respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been
    recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded since
    management does not believe that the Company will more likely
    than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future
    taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax
    assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such
    recognition. The valuation allowance decreased by
    $4.4 million in Fiscal 2010 as a result of the ability to
    utilize certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign
    taxes on $1.118 billion of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings have been and are expected
    to continue to be reinvested. These earnings could become
    subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign
    earnings were lent to PRLC, a subsidiary or a
    U.S. affiliate of PRLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries
    were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
    tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practical.
    Management believes that the amount of the additional taxes that
    might be payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if
    remitted, would be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax
    credits.

    ongoing audits

and/or

the
    expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the
    outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, the
    Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties,
    will change significantly during the next 12 months.
    However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes and timing
    of those events could cause the Company’s current estimate
    to change materially in the future.

The Company files tax returns in the U.S. federal and
    various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. With few
    exceptions for those tax returns, the Company is no longer
    subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for
    years prior to Fiscal 2004.

Euro
    Debt

As of April 3, 2010, the Company had outstanding
    €209.2 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due
    October 4, 2013 (the “Euro Debt”). The Company
    has the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any
    time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a
    premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the
    outstanding Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest
    in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax
    law. Partial redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in
    either instance. In the event of a change of control of the
    Company, each holder of the Euro Debt has the option to require
    the Company to redeem the Euro Debt at its principal amount plus
    accrued interest. The indenture governing the Euro Debt (the
    “Indenture”) contains certain limited covenants that
    restrict the Company’s ability, subject to specified
    exceptions, to incur liens or enter into a sale and leaseback
    transaction for any principal property. The Indenture does not
    contain any financial covenants.

In July 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer and used
    $121.0 million to repurchase €90.8 million of
    principal amount of its then outstanding €300 million
    principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 at
    a discounted purchase price of approximately 95%. A net pretax
    gain of $4.1 million related to this extinguishment of debt
    was recorded during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 and has
    been classified as a component of interest and other income,
    net, in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
    The Company used its cash on hand to fund the debt
    extinguishment.

Refer to Note 16 for discussion of the designation of the
    Company’s Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries.

Revolving
    Credit Facility and Term Loan

The Company has a credit facility that provides for a
    $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through
    November 2011 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
    Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of April 3, 2010, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility and the Company was
    contingently liable for $13.9 million of outstanding
    letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase
    commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its
    borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the
    agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
    facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory
    reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the
    Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility
    (“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

F-28


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. The Credit Facility also requires the Company to
    maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated
    EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”) of no greater than 3.75
    as of the date of measurement for four consecutive quarters.
    Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt
    outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent expense for the last
    twelve months. EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net
    income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest
    expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and
    (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of April 3, 2010,
    no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the
    Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s Credit
    Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenant described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of
    Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and entities controlled by
    the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum
    percentage of the voting power of the Company’s common
    stock.

The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22,
    2007 to provide for the addition of a ¥20.5 billion
    loan (the “Term Loan”), made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a
    wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The proceeds of the Term
    Loan were used to finance the Company’s acquisition of
    certain of its formerly-licensed Japanese businesses. The
    Company repaid the Term Loan by its maturity date on
    May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of the cash on-hand
    acquired as part of the acquisition. See Note 5 for further
    discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

Fair
    Value of Debt

Based on the prevailing level of market interest rates as of
    April 3, 2010, the fair value of the Company’s Euro
    Debt exceeded its carrying value by approximately
    $10 million. As of March 28, 2009, the carrying value
    of the Euro Debt exceeded its fair value by approximately
    $86 million. Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not
    result in the realization or expenditure of cash, unless the
    debt is retired prior to its maturity.

15.

Fair
    Value Measurements

US GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for
    disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the
    applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular asset or
    liability depends on the inputs used in valuation as of the
    measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are
    market-based (observable) or internally derived (unobservable).
    The three levels are defined as follows:

•

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets for substantially the full term of
    the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the
    full term of the financial instrument; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are
    observable.

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation

A financial instrument’s categorization within the

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. To the extent
    these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and highly
    effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
    being hedged, the related unrealized gains or losses are
    deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. The Company’s derivative financial
    instruments are valued using a pricing model, primarily based on
    market observable external inputs including forward and spot
    rates for foreign currencies, which considers the impact of the
    Company’s own credit risk, if any. The Company mitigates
    the impact of counterparty credit risk by entering into
    contracts with select financial institutions based on credit
    ratings and other factors, adhering to established limits for
    credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness
    of its counterparties. Changes in counterparty credit risk are
    considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.

The Company’s variable rate municipal securities
    (“VRMS”) are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and are recorded at fair value in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet based upon quoted market prices, with
    unrealized gains or losses deferred in equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income.

The Company’s auction rate securities are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and are recorded at fair value in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets, with unrealized gains or losses
    deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. Third-party pricing institutions may value
    auction rate securities at par, which may not necessarily
    reflect prices that would be obtained in the current market.
    When quoted market prices are unobservable, fair value is
    estimated based on a number of known factors and external
    pricing data, including known maturity dates, the coupon rate
    based upon the most recent reset market clearing rate, the
    price/yield representing the average rate of recently successful
    traded securities, and the total principal balance of each
    security.

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term and
    non-current investments held-to-maturity, and accounts
    receivable are recorded at carrying value, which approximates
    fair value. The Company’s Euro Debt, which is adjusted for
    foreign currency fluctuations, is also reported at carrying
    value.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s non-financial instruments, which primarily
    consist of goodwill, intangible assets, and property and
    equipment, are not required to be measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, on
    a periodic basis whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable (and
    at least annually for goodwill), non-financial instruments are
    assessed for impairment and, if applicable, written-down to and
    recorded at fair value.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company primarily has exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash
    flows from its international operations and possible declines in
    the fair value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign
    operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, the Company periodically uses derivative financial
    instruments to manage such risks.

The following table summarizes the Company’s outstanding
    derivative instruments on a gross basis as recorded in the

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that approximately
    $12 million of net gains deferred in accumulated other
    comprehensive income related to derivative financial instruments
    outstanding as of April 3, 2010 will be recognized in
    earnings. No material gains or losses relating to ineffective
    hedges were recognized during any of the fiscal years presented.

The following is a summary of the Company’s risk management
    strategies and the effect of those strategies on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company primarily enters into forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange
    rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty
    payments made by certain of its international operations,
    intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing
    efforts of its international operations, interest payments made
    in connection with outstanding debt, other foreign
    currency-denominated

F-32


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operational obligations including payroll, rent, insurance and
    benefit payments, and foreign currency-denominated revenues. As
    part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to
    the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
    primarily to changes in the value of the Euro, the Japanese Yen,
    the Swiss Franc, and the British Pound Sterling, the Company
    hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated
    over the ensuing twelve-month to two-year periods. In doing so,
    the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts
    that generally have maturities of three months to two years to
    provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period.

The Company records its foreign currency exchange contracts at
    fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. To the extent
    foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow
    hedges at hedge inception are highly effective in offsetting the
    change in the value of the hedged item, the related gains
    (losses) are deferred in equity as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. These deferred gains (losses) are
    then recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as
    follows:

•

Forecasted Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as
    part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of
    goods sold when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments

and

Marketing
    Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency
    gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Operational Obligations

— Recognized primarily
    within SG&A expenses in the period in which the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings.

•

Interest Payments on Euro Debt

— Recognized
    within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which
    the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency
    exchange remeasurement.

During the first quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company entered
    into two foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the
    foreign exchange cash flow variability associated with the then
    forecasted repurchase of a portion of the Company’s
    outstanding Euro-denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009. The
    exchange contracts had an aggregate notional value of
    $123.0 million and were designated as cash flow hedges.
    Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the
    Company’s partial repurchase of its Euro-denominated
    4.5% notes.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company designated the entire principal amount of its
    outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries. The changes in fair value
    of a derivative instrument or changes in a non-derivative
    financial instrument (such as debt) that is designated as a
    hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in
    the same manner as a translation adjustment, to the extent it is
    effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the
    Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have
    been, and continue to be, reported in equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income.

In assessing effectiveness, the Company uses the spot rate
    method of accounting to value foreign currency exchange rate
    changes in both its foreign subsidiaries and the derivative
    designated as a hedge of a net investment. If the notional
    amount of the derivative designated as a hedge of a net
    investment is greater than the portion of the net investment
    being hedged, hedge ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in
    earnings. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument
    are recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income until the sale or liquidation of the hedged
    net investment.

Investments

The Company classifies its investments in securities at the time
    of purchase as either

held-to-maturity,

available-for-sale

or trading, and re-evaluates such classifications on a quarterly
    basis.

F-33


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Held-to-maturity

investments consist of debt securities that the Company has the
    intent and ability to retain until maturity. These securities
    are recorded at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums
    and discounts, which approximates fair value.

Available-for-sale

investments primarily consist of VRMS and auction rate
    securities. VRMS represent long-term municipal bonds with
    interest rates that reset at pre-determined short-term
    intervals, and can typically be put to the issuer and redeemed
    for cash upon demand, or shortly thereafter. Auction rate
    securities also have characteristics similar to short-term
    investments. However, the Company has classified these
    securities as non-current investments in its consolidated
    balance sheet as current market conditions call into question
    its ability to redeem these investments for cash within the next
    twelve months.

Available-for-sale

investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or
    losses classified as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets,
    and related realized gains or losses classified as a component
    of interest and other income, net, in the consolidated
    statements of operations. No material unrealized or realized
    gains or losses on

available-for-sale

investments were recognized during any of the fiscal years
    presented.

Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and purchase of
    investments are classified as investing activities in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

The following table summarizes the Company’s short-term and
    non-current investments recorded in the consolidated balance
    sheets as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

The Company operates its retail stores under various leasing
    arrangements. The Company also occupies various office and
    warehouse facilities and uses certain equipment under numerous
    lease agreements. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for as
    either operating leases or capital leases. In this context,
    capital leases include leases whereby the Company is considered
    to have the substantive risks of ownership during construction
    of a leased property. Information on the Company’s
    operating and capital leasing activities is set forth below.

F-34


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Operating
    Leases

The Company is typically required to make minimum rental
    payments, and often contingent rental payments, under its
    operating leases. Substantially all factory and full-price
    retail store leases provide for contingent rentals based upon
    sales, and certain rental agreements require payment based
    solely on a percentage of sales. Terms of the Company’s
    leases generally contain renewal options, rent escalation
    clauses and landlord incentives. Rent expense, net of sublease
    income which was not significant, was approximately
    $267 million in Fiscal 2010, $237 million in Fiscal
    2009 and $208 million in Fiscal 2008. Such amounts include
    contingent rental charges of approximately $39 million for
    Fiscal 2010, $33 million for Fiscal 2009 and
    $14 million for Fiscal 2008. In addition to such amounts,
    the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and
    occupancy costs relating to the leased real estate properties.

As of April 3, 2010, future minimum rental payments under
    noncancelable operating leases with lease terms in excess of one
    year were as follows:

Employment
    Agreements

The Company has employment agreements with certain executives in
    the normal course of business which provide for compensation and
    certain other benefits. These agreements also provide for
    severance payments under certain circumstances.

Other
    Commitments

Other off-balance sheet firm commitments, which include
    inventory purchase commitments, outstanding letters of credit
    and minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to
    approximately $776 million as of April 3, 2010.

Litigation

California
    Class Action Litigation

On October 11, 2007 and November 2, 2007, two class
    action lawsuits were filed by two customers in state court in
    California asserting that while they were shopping at certain of
    the Company’s factory stores in California, the Company
    allegedly required them to provide certain personal information
    at the

point-of-sale

in order to complete a credit card purchase. The plaintiffs
    purported to represent a class of customers in California who
    allegedly were injured by being forced to provide their address
    and telephone numbers in order to use their credit cards to
    purchase items from the Company’s stores, which allegedly
    violated Section 1747.08 of California’s Song-Beverly
    Act. The complaints sought an unspecified amount of statutory
    penalties, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. The
    Company subsequently had the actions moved to the United States
    District Court for the Eastern and Central Districts of
    California. The Company commenced mediation proceedings with
    respect to these lawsuits and on October 17, 2008, the
    Company agreed in principle to settle these claims by agreeing
    to issue $20 merchandise discount coupons with six month
    expiration dates to eligible parties and paying the
    plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The court granted
    preliminary approval of the settlement terms on July 17,
    2009. In connection with this settlement, the Company recorded a
    $5 million reserve against its expected loss exposure
    during the second quarter of Fiscal 2009. As part of the
    required settlement process, the Company notified the relevant
    attorneys general regarding the potential settlement, and no
    objections were registered. At a hearing on December 7,
    2009, the Court held that the terms of the settlement were fair,
    just and reasonable and provided fair compensation for class
    members. In addition, the Court overruled an objection that had
    been filed by a single customer. The Court then denied the
    objector’s subsequent motion for the Court to reconsider
    its order on the fairness of the settlement. The period within
    which the objector had to appeal or otherwise seek relief from
    the Court’s orders expired in February 2010 without an
    appeal and the settlement is effective. Accordingly, the coupons
    were issued in February with an expiration date of
    August 16, 2010. Based on coupon redemption experience to
    date, the Company reversed $1.7 million of its original
    $5 million reserve into income during the fourth quarter of
    Fiscal 2010.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports,
    Ltd.

(“Wathne”), our then domestic
    licensee for luggage and handbags, filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York
    against the Company and Ralph Lauren, our Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other things, federal
    trademark law violations, breach of contract, breach of
    obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
    misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other relief,
    injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for breach of
    contract related claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. Following some discovery, we moved for
    summary judgment on the remaining

F-36


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

claims. Wathne cross-moved for partial summary judgment. In an
    April 11, 2008 Decision and Order, the court granted
    Polo’s summary judgment motion to dismiss most of the
    claims against the Company, and denied Wathne’s
    cross-motion for summary judgment. Wathne appealed the dismissal
    of its claims to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.
    Following a hearing on May 19, 2009, the Appellate Division
    issued a Decision and Order on June 9, 2009 which, in large
    part, affirmed the lower court’s ruling. Discovery on those
    claims that were not dismissed is ongoing and a trial date has
    not yet been set. We intend to continue to contest the remaining
    claims in this lawsuit vigorously. Management does not expect
    that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or financial
    position.

California
    Labor Litigation

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs
    purported to represent a class of employees who allegedly had
    been injured by not properly being paid commission earnings, not
    being paid overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to
    work off of the clock while waiting to enter or leave stores and
    being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave stores. The
    complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of profits,
    punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive and
    declaratory relief. Subsequent to answering the complaint, we
    had the action moved to the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California. On July 8, 2008, the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California granted plaintiffs’ motion for class
    certification and subsequently denied our motion to decertify
    the class. On November 5, 2008, the District Court stayed
    litigation of the rest break claims pending the resolution of a
    separate California Supreme Court case on the standards of class
    treatment for rest break claims. On January 25, 2010, the
    District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion to sever the rest
    break claims from the rest of the case and denied our motion to
    decertify the waiting time claims. The District Court also
    ordered that a trial be held on the waiting time and overtime
    claims, which commenced on March 8, 2010. During trial, the
    parties reached an agreement to settle all of the claims in the
    litigation, including the rest break claims, for
    $4 million. The District Court held a hearing on
    May 14, 2010 and advised the parties that it would grant
    preliminary approval of the settlement. Once the Court enters an
    order granting preliminary approval of the settlement, the
    members of the class will have 60 days from the date of
    preliminary approval to submit claims or object to the
    settlement. A hearing has been scheduled for August 20,
    2010 for the District Court to determine if final approval of
    the settlement should be granted. In connection with this
    settlement, the Company recorded a $4 million reserve
    against its expected loss exposure during the fourth quarter of
    Fiscal 2010.

Other
    Matters

We are otherwise involved, from time to time, in litigation,
    other legal claims and proceedings involving matters associated
    with or incidental to our business, including, among other
    things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other
    intellectual property, licensing, and employee relations. We
    believe that the resolution of currently pending matters will
    not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
    However, our assessment of the current litigation or other legal
    claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not
    presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or
    other finders of fact which are not in accord with
    management’s evaluation of the possible liability or
    outcome of such litigation or claims.

Equity

Capital
    Stock

The Company’s capital stock consists of two classes of
    common stock. There are 500 million shares of Class A
    common stock and 100 million shares of Class B common
    stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and
    Class B common stock have substantially identical rights,
    except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A

common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of
    Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share.
    Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class
    on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval,
    except with respect to the election and removal of directors or
    as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares
    of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and entities
    controlled by the Lauren family and are convertible at any time
    into shares of Class A common stock on a

one-for-one

basis.

Class B
    Common Stock Conversion

During Fiscal 2010, Mr. Ralph Lauren converted
    1.2 million shares of Class B common stock into an
    equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to
    the terms of the security. This transaction resulted in a
    reclassification within equity, and had no net effect on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year
    ended April 3, 2010.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

On November 4, 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved an expansion of the Company’s existing common
    stock repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase
    up to an additional $225 million of Class A common
    stock. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are
    subject to overall business and market conditions.

In Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of
    $215.9 million under its repurchase program. The remaining
    availability under the Company’s common stock repurchase
    program was approximately $275 million as of April 3,
    2010. In addition, in Fiscal 2010, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as
    amended (the “1997 Plan”).

In Fiscal 2009, 1.8 million shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of
    $126.2 million. Also, during the first quarter of Fiscal
    2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of Fiscal
    2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. In addition,
    in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of Class A common
    stock at a cost of $19.6 million were surrendered to, or
    withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in
    connection with the vesting of awards under the 1997 Plan.

In Fiscal 2008, share repurchases amounted to 6.1 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $476.4 million, including $24.0 million
    (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of
    the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. In
    addition, in Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the 1997 Plan.

Repurchased and surrendered shares are accounted for as treasury
    stock at cost and will be held in treasury for future use.

On May 18, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a further expansion of the Company’s existing
    common stock repurchase program that allows the Company to
    repurchase up to an additional $275 million of Class A
    common stock.

Dividends

Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash
    dividend program on its common stock. On November 4, 2009,
    the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to
    the Company’s quarterly cash dividend on its common stock
    from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share. Dividends paid amounted
    to $24.7 million in Fiscal 2010, $19.9 million in
    Fiscal 2009 and $20.5 million in Fiscal 2008.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable ratably
    (a graded-vesting schedule), over a three-year vesting period.
    Stock options generally expire seven years from the date of
    grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have graded vesting and no performance
    conditions on an accelerated basis. The Company uses the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of
    stock options granted, which requires the input of both
    subjective and objective assumptions as follows:

Expected Term

— The estimate of expected term
    is based on the historical exercise behavior of employees and
    non-employee directors, as well as the contractual life of the
    option grants.

Expected Volatility

— The expected volatility
    factor is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock for a period equal to the stock
    option’s expected term.

Expected Dividend Yield

— The expected dividend
    yield is based on the Company’s quarterly cash dividend of
    (a) $0.05 per share for grants made prior to the third
    quarter of Fiscal 2010 and (b) $0.10 per share for grants
    made during and after the third quarter of Fiscal 2010.

Risk-free Interest Rate

— The risk-free
    interest rate is determined using the implied yield for a traded
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the
    option’s expected term.

The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used to estimate
    the fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years
    presented were as follows:

Restricted
    Stock and RSUs

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based RSUs to certain of its senior executives
    and non-employee directors. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to such senior executives and other key
    executives, and certain other employees of the Company.

Restricted shares of Class A common stock, which entitle
    the holder to receive a specified number of shares of
    Class A common stock at the end of a vesting period, are
    accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. In addition,
    holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash
    dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the
    Company’s Class A common stock. Generally, restricted
    stock grants vest over a five-year period of time, subject to
    the executive’s continuing employment. Restricted stock
    shares granted to non-employee directors vest over a three-year
    period of time.

RSUs entitle the grantee to receive shares of Class A
    common stock at the end of a vesting period. Service-based RSUs
    are payable in shares of Class A common stock and generally
    vest over a five-year period of time, subject to the
    executive’s continuing employment. Performance-based RSUs
    also are payable in shares of Class A common stock and
    generally vest (a) upon the completion of a three-year
    period of time (cliff vesting), subject to the

employee’s continuing employment and the Company’s
    achievement of certain performance goals over the three-year
    period or (b) ratably, over a three-year period of time
    (graded vesting), subject to the employee’s continuing
    employment during the applicable vesting period and the
    achievement by the Company of certain performance goals either
    (i) in each year of the three-year vesting period for
    grants made prior to Fiscal 2008 or (ii) solely in the
    initial year of the three-year vesting period for grants made
    during and after Fiscal 2008. In addition, holders of certain
    RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the form of
    additional RSUs in connection with the payment of dividends on
    the Company’s Class A common stock. RSUs, including
    shares resulting from dividend equivalents paid on such units,
    are accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. The fair
    value of a restricted security is based on the fair value of
    unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect
    the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that
    are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense
    for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the related
    service period when attainment of the performance goals is
    deemed probable.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Profit
    Sharing Retirement Savings Plans

The Company sponsors two defined contribution benefit plans
    covering substantially all eligible U.S. employees not
    covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include
    a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal
    Revenue Code. The Company makes discretionary contributions to
    the plans and contributes an amount equal to 50% of the first 6%
    of salary contributed by an employee.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is 100% vested in
    Company matching and discretionary contributions after five
    years of credited service. Contributions made by the Company
    under these plans approximated $6 million in each of the
    three fiscal years presented.

Supplemental
    Retirement Plan

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for
    certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the
    401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans are expected to
    be constrained by the operation of certain Internal Revenue Code
    limitations. These supplemental benefits vest over time and the
    related compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period.

In August 2008, the Company amended its non-qualified
    supplemental retirement plan. The amendments included a
    suspension of the annual contributions for substantially all
    plan participants effective for Fiscal 2009. Further, affected
    participants were provided with a one-time election to either
    withdraw all benefits vested in the plan in a lump sum amount or
    remain in the plan and receive future distributions of benefits
    vested over a

5-year

period. In connection with this one-time election, the Company
    paid out approximately $18 million to affected participants
    during the first quarter of Fiscal 2010.

Notwithstanding amounts accrued for the one-time withdrawal
    payout noted above, amounts accrued under this plan totaled
    $11 million as of March 28, 2009 and were classified
    within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheet. The amounts accrued under this plan totaled
    $10 million as of April 3, 2010 and were classified
    within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheet. Total compensation expense recognized related to these
    benefits was $0.2 million, $2 million and
    $4 million in Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plans

The Company has deferred compensation arrangements for certain
    key executives which generally provide for payments upon
    retirement, death or termination of employment. The amounts
    accrued under these plans were approximately $1 million as
    of April 3, 2010 and $2 million as of March 28,
    2009, and were classified within other non-current liabilities
    in the consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense
    related to these compensation arrangements was $0.3 million
    in each of the three fiscal years presented. The Company funds a
    portion of these obligations through the establishment of trust
    accounts on behalf of the executives participating in the plans.
    The trust accounts are classified within other assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Union
    Pension Plan

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is
    required to make contributions to the UNITE HERE (which was
    previously known as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
    Textile Employees, prior to its merger with the Hotel Employees
    and Restaurant Employees International Union)
    (“Union”) for dues based on wages paid to union
    employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to
    a retirement fund which provides defined benefits to
    substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not
    participate in the management of the plan and has not been
    furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits
    provided, vested and non-vested benefits or assets.

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a
    multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its
    proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits.
    Such withdrawal liability was assumed in conjunction with the
    acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee.
    The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the
    plan.

International
    Defined Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit
    plans at international locations which are not considered to be
    material individually or in the aggregate. Pension benefits
    under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the
    employees’ years of service and compensation levels during
    their employment period. The aggregate funded status of the
    single-employer defined benefit plans were net liabilities of
    $5.1 million and $7.3 million as of April 3, 2010
    and March 28, 2009, respectively, primarily recorded within
    other non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. These single-employer defined benefit plans had
    aggregate projected benefit obligations of $25.4 million
    and aggregate fair values of plan assets of $22.5 million
    as of April 3, 2010, compared to projected benefit
    obligations of $26.9 million and aggregate fair values of
    plan assets of $22.9 million as of March 28, 2009. The
    asset portfolio of the single-employer defined benefit plans
    primarily consists of debt securities, which have been measured
    at fair value largely using Level 2 inputs, as defined in
    Note 15. Pension expense for these plans, recorded within
    SG&A expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations, was $4.2 million in Fiscal 2010,
    $4.0 million in Fiscal 2009 and $3.6 million in Fiscal
    2008.

On March 31, 2009, the Company withdrew from the remaining
    multi-employer defined benefit plan assumed in the Japanese
    Business Acquisitions. A related withdrawal liability of
    approximately $4 million was classified within other
    non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet as of March 28, 2009. Total contributions to
    the multi-employer plan were $0.1 million in Fiscal 2010,
    $0.6 million in Fiscal 2009 and $0.5 million in Fiscal
    2008.

On April 1, 2009, the Company integrated all of its
    Japanese single-employer defined benefit plans into one defined
    contribution and cash balance plan (the “Integrated Japan
    Pension Plan”). As a result of this integration, certain of
    the Company’s pre-existing Japanese single-employer defined
    benefit plans were settled. The Company recorded a related
    settlement charge of approximately $0.2 million in the
    consolidated statement of operations during Fiscal 2010.

Segment
    Information

The Company has three reportable segments based on its business
    activities and organization: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.
    Such segments offer a variety of products through different
    channels of distribution. The Wholesale segment consists of
    women’s, men’s and children’s apparel,
    accessories and related products which are sold to major
    department stores, specialty stores, golf and pro shops and the
    Company’s owned and licensed retail stores in the
    U.S. and overseas. The Retail segment consists of the
    Company’s worldwide retail operations, which sell products
    through its full-price and factory stores, its concessions-based
    shop-within-shops, as well as RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com, its

e-commerce

websites. The stores, concessions-based shop-within-shops and
    websites sell products purchased from the Company’s
    licensees, suppliers and Wholesale segment. The Licensing
    segment generates revenues from royalties earned on the sale of
    the Company’s apparel, home and other products
    internationally and domestically through licensing alliances.
    The licensing agreements grant the licensees rights to use the
    Company’s various trademarks in connection with the
    manufacture and sale of designated products in specified
    geographical areas for specified periods.

The accounting policies of the Company’s segments are
    consistent with those described in Note 2 and Note 3.
    Sales and transfers between segments generally are recorded at
    cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany
    revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed
    when evaluating segment performance. Each segment’s
    performance is evaluated based upon operating income before
    restructuring charges and certain other one-time items, such as
    legal charges, if any. Corporate overhead expenses (exclusive of
    certain

expenses for senior management, overall branding-related
    expenses and certain other corporate-related expenses) are
    allocated to the segments based upon specific usage or other
    allocation methods.

Due to changes in the Company’s segment presentation as
    discussed in Note 2, segment information for Fiscal 2009
    has been recast to conform to the current period’s
    presentation. These changes entirely related to
    reclassifications between the Company’s Wholesale and
    Retail segments, and had no impact on total net revenues, total
    operating income or total assets. In addition, these changes had
    no impact on net revenues by geographic location. Segment
    information for Fiscal 2008 has not been recast to conform to
    the current period’s presentation, as it is impracticable
    to do so.

    Company’s new (recasted) basis of reporting are as follows:

    which $12.7 million related to the Retail segment,
    $7.3 million related to the Wholesale segment and
    $3.6 million related to Corporate operations (see Note 12).
    Legal-related activity for Fiscal 2010 consisted of legal
    charges of $4.8 million primarily related to the
    Company’s California Labor Litigation matter, offset in
    part by the reversal of an excess legal reserve of
    $1.7 million (see Note 17). Legal-related activity for
    Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008 consisted of the reversal of excess
    legal reserves in the amounts of $0.5 million and

Related
    Party Transactions

In the ordinary course of conducting its business, the Company
    periodically enters into transactions with other entities or
    people that are considered related parties.

In connection with the launch of the RL Watch Company business,
    the Company receives royalty payments pursuant to a related
    licensing agreement that allows the RL Watch Company to sell
    luxury watches and fine jewelry throughout the world using
    certain of the Company’s trademarks. The Company has a 50%
    interest in the RL Watch Company, which is accounted for under
    the equity method of accounting. Royalty payments received under
    this arrangement were approximately $0.1 million in Fiscal
    2010. No related payments were received in Fiscal 2009 or Fiscal
    2008. See Note 3 for further discussion of the
    Company’s investment in the RL Watch Company.

In addition, during Fiscal 2008, Mr. Ralph Lauren, Chairman
    of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, sometimes used the
    services of certain employees of the Company for non-Company
    related purposes. Mr. Lauren reimbursed the Company for the
    direct expenses incurred in connection with those services,
    including an allocation of such employees’ salaries and
    benefits. Such aggregate costs and related reimbursements were
    less than $1 million in Fiscal 2008. No related services
    were provided by the Company to Mr. Lauren in Fiscal 2010
    or Fiscal 2009.

    was traded prior to the end of the fiscal year for which
    settlement occurred in April 2008. In addition, as a result of
    the adoption of FIN 48, the Company recognized a non-cash
    reduction in retained earnings of $62.5 million as the
    cumulative effect to adjust its net liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits as of April 1, 2007.

There were no other significant non-cash investing or financing
    activities for the three fiscal years presented.

MANAGEMENT’S
    RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation is responsible
    for the preparation, objectivity and integrity of the
    consolidated financial statements and other information
    contained in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial
    statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States and
    include some amounts that are based on management’s
    informed judgments and best estimates.

These consolidated financial statements have been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP in Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 and
    by Deloitte & Touche LLP in Fiscal 2008, both of which
    are independent registered public accounting firms. They
    conducted their audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
    have expressed herein their unqualified opinions on those
    financial statements.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which oversees
    all of the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf
    of the Board of Directors, consists solely of independent
    directors, meets with the independent registered accountants,
    internal auditors and management periodically to review their
    respective activities and the discharge of their respective
    responsibilities. Both the independent registered public
    accountants and the internal auditors have unrestricted access
    to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss
    the scope and results of their audits and any recommendations
    regarding the system of internal controls.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of April 3, 2010 and March 28,
    2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    equity, and cash flows for the fiscal years then ended. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of the Company at April 3, 2010 and
    March 28, 2009, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years then ended,
    in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 3, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

    fiscal year ended March 29, 2008. These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s

    financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the

    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a

In our opinion, such Fiscal 2008 consolidated financial
    statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results
    of the Company’s operations, its cash flows and its equity
    for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2008, in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and
    subsidiaries’ (the “Company’s”) internal
    control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2010, based
    on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
    criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 3, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of April 3,
    2010 and March 28, 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for the fiscal
    years then ended and our report dated June 2, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
