We are a leader in the design, marketing and distribution of
premium lifestyle products. For more than 37 years, our
reputation and distinctive image have been consistently
developed across an expanding number of products, brands and
international markets. Our brand names, which include
“Polo,” “Polo by Ralph Lauren,” “Ralph
Lauren Purple Label,” “Polo Sport,” “Ralph
Lauren,” “Blue Label,” “Lauren,”
“Polo Jeans,” “RL,” “Rugby,”
“Chaps” and “Club Monaco,” among others,
constitute one of the world’s most widely recognized
families of consumer brands. We believe that, under the
direction of Ralph Lauren, the internationally renowned
designer, we have influenced the manner in which people dress
and live in contemporary society, reflecting an American
perspective and lifestyle uniquely associated with Polo and
Ralph Lauren.

We operate in three business segments: wholesale, retail and
licensing, and a substantial portion of our licensing business
is international. We combine our consumer insight and design,
marketing and imaging skills to offer, along with our licensing

Recent Developments

On May 23, 2005, the Company entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire from Reebok International, Ltd all the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren
Footwear Co., Inc, the global licensee for men’s,
women’s and children’s footwear, as well as certain
foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok International Ltd
(“the Footwear Business”). The purchase price for the
acquisition of the Footwear Business will be approximately
$110 million in cash payable at closing, subject to closing
adjustments. Payment of the Purchase Price will be funded by
cash on hand and lines of credit as required. In addition, the
Footwear Licensee and certain of its affiliates have entered
into a transition services agreement with the Company to provide
a variety of operational, financial and information systems
services over a period of twelve to eighteen months.

The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to customary
conditions, including the receipt of certain third party
consents and the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976. The closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in
July 2005.

On July 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of certain
assets of RL Childrenswear Company LLC. See “Recent
Acquisitions.”

As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel Group, Inc.
(including its subsidiaries, “Jones”) to meet the
minimum sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2002
under the license agreements for the sale of products under the
“Ralph” trademark between us and Jones dated
May 11, 1998, these license agreements terminated as of
December 31, 2003. We advised Jones that the termination of
these licenses would automatically result in the termination on
that date of the licenses between us and Jones with respect to
the “Lauren” trademark pursuant to the Cross Default
and Term Extension Agreement between us and Jones dated
May 11, 1998. The Lauren license agreements would otherwise
have expired on December 31, 2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit against us in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York alleging, among other
things, that we had breached our agreements with Jones with
respect to the “Lauren” trademark by asserting our
rights under the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement, and
that we induced Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the former President
of Jones, to breach the non-compete and confidentiality clauses
in Ms. Nemerov’s employment agreement with Jones.
Jones stated that it would treat the Lauren license agreements
as terminated as of December 31, 2003, and is seeking
compensatory damages of $550.0 million, punitive damages
and enforcement of the provisions of Ms. Nemerov’s
agreement. Also on June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against
Jones in the Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking,
among other things, an injunction and a declaratory judgement
that the Lauren license agreements would terminate as of
December 31, 2003 pursuant to the terms of the Cross
Default and Term Extension Agreement. The two lawsuits were
consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to dismiss Jones’
claims regarding breach of the “Lauren” agreements and
a motion to stay the claims regarding Ms. Nemerov pending
the arbitration of Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On
July 23, 2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgement
in the action filed by us, and on August 12, 2003, we filed
a cross-motion for summary judgement. On March 18, 2004,
the Court entered orders (i) denying our motion to dismiss
Jones’ claims against us for breach of the Lauren
agreements and (ii) granting Jones’ motion for summary
judgement in our action for declaratory judgement that the
Lauren agreement terminated on December 31, 2003 and
dismissing our complaint. The orders also stayed Jones’
claim against us relating to Ms. Nemerov pending
arbitration regarding her alleged breach of her employment
agreement. On August 24, 2004, the Court denied our motions
to reconsider its orders, and we appealed the orders.

On March 24, 2005, the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court affirmed the lower Court’s orders. On April 22,
2005, we filed a motion with the Appellate Division for
reargument and/or permission to appeal its decision to the New
York Court of Appeals. On June 23, 2005, the Appellate
Division denied our request for reargument, but granted our
motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. If the Court
of Appeals does not reverse the Appellate Division’s
decision, the case will go back to the lower Court for a trial
on damages. Although we intend to continue to defend the case
vigorously, in light of the Appellate Division’s decision we



recorded a charge to establish a reserve of $100.0 million
during Fiscal 2005. This charge represents management’s
best estimate at this time of the loss incurred. No discovery
has been held, and the ultimate outcome of this matter could
differ materially from the reserved amount.

As described in more detail in Note 21 to the Financial
Statements (which is incorporated herein by reference), we are
subject to various claims relating to an alleged security breach
of our retail point of sale system, including fraudulent credit
card charges, the cost of replacing cards and related monitoring
expenses and other related claims. The Company is unable to
predict at this time whether further claims will be asserted.
The Company has contested and will continue to vigorously
contest the claims made against it and continues to explore its
defenses and possible claims against others. The Company
recorded a charge to establish a reserve of $6.2 million
relating to this matter in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005.
The ultimate outcome of this matter could differ from the amount
reserved. While that difference could be material to the results
of operations for any affected reporting period, it is not
expected to have a material impact on consolidated financial
position or liquidity.

In June 2003, one of our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens,
Inc., and certain of its affiliates (“WestPoint”)
filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint
produces bedding and bath product in our home collection, and
royalties paid by WestPoint accounted for 14.2% of our licensing
revenues in Fiscal 2005. On December 19, 2003, the United
States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement
between WestPoint and us which provides for the same royalty
rate and minimums that are not materially less than the previous
agreement. On June 24, 2005, American Real Estate
Properties, LP, an entity controlled by investor Carl Icahn, won
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved bidding process for
WestPoint’s assets, subject to final confirmation at a
hearing to be held August 17, 2005. The Company believes
that the new owners will continue the relationship on
satisfactory terms. The contract with WestPoint Stevens expires
in December of 2005.

In October 2004, we expanded and extended our revolving credit
facility. See Item 7 “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for
further information.

Recent Acquisitions

On July 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of certain
assets of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC for a purchase price of
approximately $263.5 million, including transaction costs.
The purchase price includes deferred payments of
$15 million over the next three years, and we have agreed
to assume certain liabilities. Additionally, we have agreed to
pay up to an additional $5 million in contingent payments
if certain sales targets are attained. During the third quarter
of Fiscal 2005, we recorded a $5 million liability
representing the contingent purchase payment because we believe
it is probable the sales targets will be achieved. This amount
was recorded as an increase in goodwill. RL Childrenswear
Company LLC was a Polo Ralph Lauren licensee holding the
exclusive licenses to design, manufacture, merchandise and sell
newborn, infant, toddler and girls and boys clothing in the
United States, Canada and Mexico. In connection with this
acquisition, we recorded fair values of assets as follows:
inventory of $26.6 million, property and equipment of
$7.5 million, intangible assets consisting of non-compete
agreements valued at $2.5 million and customer
relationships valued at $29.9 million, other assets of
$1.0 million, goodwill of $208.3 million and
liabilities of $12.3 million.

The results of operations for the Childrenswear line from
July 2, 2004 are included in our the consolidated results
of operations for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2005.

The following unaudited pro forma information assumes the
Childrenswear acquisition had occurred on March 30, 2003.
The pro forma information, as presented below, is not indicative
of the results that would have been obtained had the transaction
occurred March 30, 2003, nor is it indicative of our future
results. The unaudited pro forma information is presented based
on the preliminary purchase price allocation. The final purchase
price allocation and the resulting effect on net income may
differ significantly from the unaudited pro forma amounts
included herein.



The pro forma amounts reflect adjustments for purchases made by
us from Childrenswear, licensing royalties paid to us by
Childrenswear, amortization of the non-compete agreements, lost
interest income on the cash used for the purchase and the income
tax effect based upon unaudited pro forma effective tax rate of
35.5% in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. The unaudited pro forma
information gives effect only to adjustments described above and
does not reflect management’s estimate of any anticipated
cost savings or other benefits as a result of the acquisition.
The unaudited pro forma amounts include material non recurring
charges recorded within cost of goods sold of approximately
$7.4 million related to the write up to fair value of
inventory as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation
(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts).

Department stores represent the largest customer group of our
wholesale group. Significant department store customers based on
a percentage of worldwide wholesale net sales for the year ended
April 2, 2005 are:

•

Federated Department Stores, Inc., which represented 18.0%,

•

Dillard Department Stores, Inc., which represented
    17.3%, and

•

The May Department Stores Company, which represented 15.8%.

As noted in Risk Factors, the Federated Department Stores, Inc.
and May Department Stores Company have agreed to merge. If the
merger is consummated, it would significantly increase our
credit exposure to a single customer.

Our product brands are sold primarily through their own sales
forces. Our Wholesale groups maintain their primary showrooms in
New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, London,
Munich, Madrid and Stockholm.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical element of our
distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners
utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand recognition, to
permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the
department stores and to differentiate the presentation of
products. Shop-within-shops fixed assets primarily include items
such as customized freestanding fixtures, moveable wall cases
and components, decorative items and flooring. We capitalize our
share of the cost of these fixed assets and amortize them using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of
three to five years.

At April 2, 2005, we had approximately 6,854
shop-within-shops dedicated to our wholesale products and our
licensing partner had more than 697 shop-within-shops dedicated
to our licensed products worldwide. During Fiscal 2005, we added
approximately 996 shop-within-shops. Excluding significantly
larger shop-within-shops in key department store locations, the
size of our shop-within-shops typically ranges from
approximately 130 to 4,800 square feet for Polo products,
from approximately 240 to 4,000 square feet for Lauren by
Ralph Lauren, from approximately 100 to 600 square feet for
our Collection Brands, and from approximately 300 to 900 square
feet for Home Furnishings. In total, we estimate that
approximately 3.9 million square feet of department store
space worldwide is dedicated to our shop-within-shops. In
addition to shop-within-shops, we use exclusively fixtured areas
in department stores.

Basic Stock Replenishment Program.

Basic products such as
knit shirts, chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered
at any time through our basic stock replenishment programs. We
generally ship these products within one to five days of order
receipt. These products accounted for approximately 5.2% of our
wholesale net sales in Fiscal 2005. We have also implemented a
seasonal quick response program to allow replenishment of
products which can be ordered for only a portion of each year.



Retail Segment

A primary strategic focus of the Company has been the
development of retail stores dedicated to the sale of our
products. Located in prime retail areas, our 130 full-price
stores operate under the following names:

In addition to generating sales of our products, our worldwide
full-price stores set, reinforce and capitalize on the image of
our brands. We have 6 Flagship Ralph Lauren stores, which
showcase our upper end luxury styles and products and
demonstrate our most refined merchandising techniques. During
Fiscal 2005, we added 16 full price stores, net of 4 store
closings. Our stores range in size from approximately 1,100 to
over 37,500 square feet. These full-price stores are
situated in upscale regional malls and major upscale street
locations, generally in large urban markets. We generally lease
our stores for initial periods ranging from 5 to 10 years
with renewal options.

We extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our
103 domestic Polo Ralph Lauren outlet stores, 19 domestic Polo
Jeans outlet stores, 5 Club Monaco outlet stores and 21 European
outlet stores. During Fiscal 2005, we added 1 new outlet store,
net of 9 store closings. Our outlet stores are generally located
in outlet malls.

•

Polo Ralph Lauren

outlet stores offer selections of our
    menswear, womenswear, children’s apparel, accessories, home

    9,100 square feet, these stores are principally located in
    major outlet centers in 35 states and Puerto Rico.

•

Polo Jeans

    the Polo Jeans line, including denim, knit and woven tops,

    4,000 square feet, these stores are located in
    11 states, principally in major outlet centers.

    size from 2,500 to 13,200 square feet, with an average of
    approximately 5,400 square feet, these stores are located
    in 6 countries, principally in major outlet centers.

•

Ralph Lauren Media sells the full breadth of Ralph Lauren
    apparel, accessories and home products via its website at
    www.polo.com.

Outlet stores obtain products directly from us, including our
retail stores, our product licensing partners and our suppliers.

In addition, we have one remaining license with an independent
party to operate a store in the United States. We receive the
proceeds from the sale of our products to this store, which are
included in wholesale net sales, and also receive royalties from
this licensed store operator, which are included in licensing
revenue from our licensing partners sales to this store. We
generally do not receive any other compensation from the
licensee.

Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight,
design, and marketing skills with the specific product or
geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and
build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners
who:

We grant product and non-U.S. international licensing
partners the right to manufacture and sell at wholesale, and
also grant international licenses the right to sell at retail,
specified categories of products under one or more of our
trademarks. Our international licensing partners produce and
source products both independently and in conjunction with us
and our product licensing partners. Each licensing partner pays
us royalties based upon its sales of our products, subject,
generally, to a minimum royalty requirement. Other than our
Ralph Lauren Home collection licenses, which are discussed
below, these payments generally range from 2.5% to 18.0% of the
licensing partners’ sales of the licensed products. In
addition, licensing partners are required to allocate between
approximately 3% and 4% of their sales to advertise our products
and share in the creative costs associated with these products.
Larger allocations are required in connection with launches of
new products or in new territories.

We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that their
products are developed, marketed and distributed so as to
address the intended market opportunity and to present
consistently to consumers worldwide the distinctive perspective
and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects
of the design, production quality, packaging, merchandising,
distribution, advertising and promotion of Polo Ralph Lauren
products are subject to our prior approval and continuing
oversight. The result is a consistent identity for Polo Ralph
Lauren products across product categories and international
markets.

As of April 2, 2005, we had 18 product licensing partners
(excluding Ralph Lauren Home), 6 international licensing
partners and 10 Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners. We derive
a substantial portion of our net income from the licensing
revenue we receive from our licensing partners. Approximately
33.5% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2005 was derived from
three product licensing partners: West Point Stevens, Inc,
Impact21 and Jones Apparel Group, Inc., accounted for 14.2%,
12.1% and 7.2%, respectively, of licensing revenue in Fiscal
2005. (See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.)



Product Licenses

As of April 2, 2005, we had product licensing agreements
with 18 licensing partners relating to our men’s and
women’s sportswear, men’s tailored clothing, personal
wear, accessories and fragrances. The products offered by our
product licensing partners are listed below.

As described previously under the caption “Recent
Developments,” we acquired certain assets and liabilities
of RL Childrenswear, LLC, our former Childrenswear licensee for
North America, in July 2004, and we have agreed to acquire Ralph
Lauren Footwear Co., our global licensee for men’s,
women’s and children’s footwear.

International Licenses

We believe that international markets offer additional
opportunities for our quintessential American designs and
lifestyle image. We work with our international licensing
partners to facilitate international expansion. International
expansion opportunities may include:

•

the roll out of new products and brands following their launch
    in the U.S.,

•

the introduction of additional product lines,



•

the entrance into new international markets, and

the addition of Ralph Lauren or Polo Ralph Lauren stores in
    these markets.

As of April 2, 2005, we had agreements with six
international licensing partners (excluding Ralph Lauren Home
licenses):

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to
source, produce, market and/or sell some or all of our products
in a given geographic area. Economic arrangements are similar to
those of our domestic product licensing partners. We design
licensed products either alone or in collaboration with our
domestic licensing partners. Domestic licensees generally
provide international licensing partners with product or
patterns, piece goods, manufacturing locations and other
information and assistance necessary to achieve product
uniformity, for which they are often compensated.

International licensing partners also operate stores. At
April 2, 2005, they operated 44 Polo Ralph Lauren stores,
32 Polo Jeans stores, 2 Children’s stores, 10 Ralph Lauren
stores and 10 Polo outlet stores. These stores are located in
Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China,
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines as well as much of South
America and the Caribbean. Approximately 12.1% of our licensing
revenue in Fiscal 2005 was derived from one international
licensing partner, Impact21.

Our ability to maintain and increase royalties under foreign
licenses is dependent upon certain factors not within our
control, including fluctuating currency rates, currency
controls, withholding requirements levied on royalty payments,
governmental restrictions on royalty rates, political
instability and local market conditions.

See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
Business — Our business is exposed to domestic and
foreign currency fluctuations” and “Risk
Factors — Risks Related to Our Business —
Our business is subject to risks associated with importing
products.”

Ralph Lauren Home

Together with our licensing partners, we offer an extensive
collection of home products that draw upon, and add to, the
design themes of our other product lines, contributing to our
complete lifestyle concept. Products are sold under the Ralph
Lauren Home and Lauren Ralph Lauren brands in three primary
categories: bedding and bath, home décor and home
improvement. As of April 2, 2005, we had agreements with
eight domestic and two international home product licensing
partners.

We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home
licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners.
The services we perform include design, operating showrooms,
marketing, advertising and, in some cases, sales. As a result,
we receive a higher average royalty rate from our Ralph Lauren
Home collection licensing partners, typically ranging from 15.0%
to 17.0%. In general, the licensing partners manufacture, own
the inventory and ship the products. Our Ralph Lauren Home
licensing alliances generally have 3 to 5 year terms and
may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.



Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the upper tiers of
their respective markets and are offered at a range of price
levels. These products are generally distributed through several
channels of distribution, including department stores, specialty
home furnishings stores, interior design showrooms, customer
direct mail catalogs, home centers and the Internet. As with our
other products, the use of shop-within-shops is central to our
department store distribution strategy.

The Ralph Lauren Home and Lauren Ralph Lauren home products
offered by us and our domestic licensing partners are:

WestPoint Stevens, Inc. offers a basic stock replenishment
program that includes bath and bedding products and accounted
for approximately 14.2% of their net sales of Ralph Lauren Home
products in Fiscal 2005. WestPoint Stevens, Inc. accounted for
approximately 64.1% of total Ralph Lauren Home licensing revenue
in Fiscal 2005. See “Recent Developments” and
“Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
Business — Our business could suffer as a result of
consolidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in
the retail industry.”

Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative American style
associated with and defined by Ralph Lauren and our design team.
Our consistent emphasis on innovative and distinctive design has
been an important contributor to the prominence, strength and
reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the
direction of, Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which is
divided into seven departments: Menswear, Womenswear, Lauren,
Children’s, Accessories, Home and Club Monaco. We form
design teams around our brands and product categories to develop
concepts, themes and products for each brand or category. These
teams support all three segments of our business —
wholesale, retail and licensing — through close
collaboration with merchandising, sales and production staff and
licensing partners in order to gain market and other input.

Marketing

Our marketing program communicates the themes and images of our
brands and is an integral feature of our product offering.
Worldwide marketing is managed on a centralized basis through
our advertising and public relations departments in order to
ensure consistency of presentation.

We create distinctive image advertising for all our products,
conveying the particular message of each brand within the
context of our core themes. Advertisements generally portray a
lifestyle rather than a specific item and often include a
variety of products offered by both ourselves and our licensing
partners. Our primary advertising medium is print, with multiple
page advertisements appearing regularly in a range of fashion,



lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major print
advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and spring
retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to coincide
with product deliveries. In addition to print, some product
categories have utilized television and outdoor media in their
marketing programs for certain product categories.

In general, three to four percent of licensing related sales are
spent for advertising. We directly coordinate advertising
placement for our domestic product licensing partners. Together
with our licensing partners, we collectively spent more than
$200 million worldwide to advertise and promote Polo Ralph
Lauren products in Fiscal 2005.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each
of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at
major fashion shows in New York, which typically generate
extensive domestic and international media coverage. We
introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at
major fashion shows in cities such as New York or Milan, Italy.
In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our models and
sponsors, professional golfers, snowboarders, triathletes and
sports teams.

Sourcing, Production and Quality

Over 270 different manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel
products. We source both finished products and raw materials.
Raw materials include fabric, buttons and other trim and are
sourced primarily with respect to our collection brands.
Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled
products ready for shipment to our customers. We contract for
the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any
production facilities of our own. As part of our efforts to
reduce costs and enhance the efficiency of our sourcing process,
we have shifted a substantial portion of our sourcing to foreign
suppliers. In Fiscal 2005, less than 2%, by dollar volume, of
our products were produced in the United States, and over 98%,
by dollar volume, were produced outside the U.S., primarily in
Asia, Europe and South America. See “Government
Regulations” and “Risk Factors — Risks
Related to Our Business — Our business is subject to
government regulations and other risks associated with importing
products.”

Two manufacturers engaged by us accounted for approximately 17%
and 9% of our total production during Fiscal 2005, respectively.
The primary production facilities of these two manufacturers are
located in Asia.

Our product purchases are divided broadly into three brand
categories:

•

LDP Purchasing — purchases of finished products, where
    the supplier is responsible for the purchasing and carrying of
    raw materials, including all logistics and inbound duties and
    arrangements (custom and broker) to selected country port of
    entry;

•

FOB Purchasing — purchases of finished products, where
    the supplier is responsible for the purchasing and carrying of
    raw materials; and

•

CMT Purchasing — cut, make and trim purchasing, where
    we are responsible for purchasing and moving raw materials to
    finished product assemblers located around the world.

We must commit to manufacture the majority of our garments
before we receive customer orders. We also must commit to
purchase fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we
overestimate the demand for a particular product which we cannot
sell to our primary customers, we may sell the excess in our
outlet stores or sell the product through secondary distribution
channels. If we overestimate the need for a particular fabric or
yarn, that fabric or yarn may be used in garments made for
subsequent seasons or made into past season’s styles for
distribution in our outlet stores.

We have been working closely with suppliers in recent years to
reduce the lead times for fulfillment (

e.g.

, shipment) of
orders and to permit re-orders of successful programs. In
particular, we have increased the number of deliveries within
certain brands each season so that merchandise is kept fresh at
the retail level.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global
manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia
and Europe. All garments are produced according to our
specifications. Production and



quality control staff in the United States, Asia and Europe
monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct
problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have
been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance
programs, so that quality assurance is focused upon as early as
possible in the production process and flow ready merchandise
activities, allowing merchandise to be received at the
distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal
interruption.

Competition

Competition is strong in the segments of the fashion and
consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with
numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories,
fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic and foreign,
including Liz Claiborne, Inc., Jones Apparel Group, Inc., Tommy
Hilfiger Corporation, Calvin Klein, Inc. and Giorgio Armani Spa
in the branded apparel market sector, and Gucci Group N.V. and
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in the luxury market sector.
Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on
the basis of fashion, quality and service, which depend on our
ability to:

See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the
Industry in Which we Compete — We face intense
competition in the worldwide apparel industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution domestically, Ralph Lauren men’s
and women’s products are shipped from manufacturers
primarily to our distribution center in Greensboro, North
Carolina for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment to retail
customers. Ralph Lauren Childrenswear product is shipped from
our manufacturers to our Childrenswear distribution center in
Martinsburg, West Virginia. These facilities are designed to
allow for high density cube storage and utilize bar code
technology to provide inventory management and carton controls.
Product traffic management is also coordinated from these
facilities. European distribution and warehousing has been
largely consolidated into one third party facility located in
Parma, Italy.

Our full-price store and outlet store distribution and
warehousing are principally handled through the Greensboro
distribution center. Club Monaco products are distributed from
facilities in Ontario, Canada, New Jersey and California.

Ralph Lauren Media has entered into an agreement with
ValueVision Media, which operates ShopNBC, to perform its
warehousing, order fulfillment and call center functions.
ValueVision Media and the National Broadcasting Company are our
partners in Ralph Lauren Media

Management Information Systems

Our management information systems make the marketing,
manufacturing, importing and distribution of our products more
efficient by providing, among other things:

•

comprehensive order processing;

•

production information;



•

accounting information; and

•

an enterprise view of information for our marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution functions.

The point-of-sale registers in our stores enable us to track
inventory from store receipt to final sale on a real-time basis.
We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with
our point-of-sale registers and software programs, allow for
rapid stock replenishment, concise merchandise planning and
real-time inventory accounting.

We also utilize a sophisticated automated replenishment system
to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from
our wholesale customers, the movement of goods through
distribution channels, and the collection of information for
planning and forecasting. We have a collaborative relationship
with many of our suppliers that enables the Company to reduce
cash to cash cycles in the management of our inventory.

Wholesale Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise
primarily to major department stores and extend credit based on
an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition,
usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels
and the financial condition of our customers on a continuing
basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor our accounts
receivables or maintain credit insurance to manage the risks of
bad debts. Our bad debt write-offs were $2.1 million in
Fiscal 2005, representing less than one percent of net revenues.
See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
Business  — Our business could be negatively impacted
by any financial instability of our customers.”

Wholesale Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products
approximately three to five months prior to the time the
products are delivered to stores. All such orders are subject to
cancellation. As of April 2, 2005, our summer and fall
backlog was $252.1 million and $525.4 million,
respectively, compared to $215.0 million and
$474.8 million, respectively, at April 3, 2004. Our
backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing
of the market weeks for our particular lines, during which a
significant percentage of our orders are received, and the
timing of shipments. As a consequence, a comparison of backlog
from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not
be indicative of eventual shipments.

Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph Lauren” and the
famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the United
States. Other trademarks we own include:

Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks
“Ralph Lauren,” “Double RL” and
“RRL” in perpetuity in connection with, among other
things, beef and living animals. The trademarks “Double
RL” and “RRL” are currently used by the Double RL
Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. In



addition, Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal
projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including
or relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a
company wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity done by
these companies has no impact on the Company.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations and pending
applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items
of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings and
beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services,
and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration
of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and
enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the
products and services and the required registration renewals are
filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other
proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as valuable assets
in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously
seek to protect them against infringement. See
Item 3 — “Legal Proceedings.” As a
result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been
the object of counterfeiting. We have a broad enforcement
program which has been generally effective in controlling the
sale of counterfeit products in the United States and in major
markets abroad.

In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some or
all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the
course of our international expansion, we have experienced
conflicts with various third parties which have acquired
ownership rights in certain trademarks, including
“Polo” and/or a representation of a polo player
astride a horse, which would impeded our use and registration of
our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and
may arise again from time to time as we continue our
international expansion, we have successfully resolved such
conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated
settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks.
See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
Business — Our trademarks and other intellectual
property rights may not be adequately protected outside the
United States” and Item 3 — “Legal
Proceedings.” Although we have not in the past suffered any
material inhibition from doing business in desirable markets in
the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not
arise in the future as we expand product offerings and
additional trademarks to new markets.

We currently have an agreement with a third party which owned
conflicting registrations of the trademarks “Polo” and
a polo player astride a horse in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong
and South Africa. Under the agreement, the third party retains
the right to use the “Polo” and polo player symbol
marks in South Africa and all other countries that comprise
Sub-Saharan Africa, and we agreed to restrict use of those Polo
marks in those countries to fragrances and cosmetics solely as
part of the composite trademark “Ralph Lauren” and the
polo player symbol, as to which our use is unlimited, and to the
use of the polo player symbol mark on women’s and
girls’ apparel and accessories and women’s and
girls’ handkerchiefs. By agreeing to those restrictions, we
secured the unlimited right to use our trademarks in the United
Kingdom and Hong Kong without payment of any kind, and the third
party is prohibited from distributing products under those
trademarks in those countries.

Government Regulation

Pursuant to the World Trade Organization (“WTO”)
Agreement, effective January 1, 2005, the United States and
other WTO member countries removed quotas on goods from WTO
members. In certain instances, the elimination of quota affords
us greater access to foreign markets; however, as the removal of
quotas resulted in an import surge from China, the
U.S. took action in May 2005 and imposed safeguard quotas
on seven categories of goods which may adversely effect the
Company’s ability to import product from China in 2005. On
June 10, 2005, in response to the surge of Chinese imports
into the European Union (“EU”), the EU Commission
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with
China in which 10 categories of textiles and apparel will be
subject to restraints. This may also effect our ability to
import product into the EU in these 10 categories during 2005.

Our imported products are also subject to U.S. customs
duties which comprise a material portion of the cost of the
merchandise. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related To
Our Business — Our business is subject to risks
associated with importing products.”

Exports of certain of our US-manufactured products into the
European market are subject to increased duties of
15 percent starting May 2005 until such time as the Byrd
Amendment is repealed by the Congress.



Additional punitive duties may be imposed in the first quarter
of 2006 should the US Congress not repeal the Foreign Sales
Corporation/ Extra-Territorial Income Tax Exclusion Act.

Apparel products and other merchandise sold by Polo may also be
subject to regulation in the United States by other governmental
agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, United States
Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer Products Safety
Commission. These regulations relate principally to product
labeling, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We
believe that we are in substantial compliance with those
regulations as well as applicable federal, state, local, and
foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of
materials hazardous to the environment. We do not estimate any
significant capital expenditures for environmental control
matters either in the current year or in the near future. Our
licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to
regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to
operate in compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are
not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on our business.

Although we have not in the past suffered any material
inhibition from doing business in desirable markets in the past,
we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in
the future as we expand product offerings and additional
trademarks to new markets.

Employees

As of April 2, 2005, we had approximately 12,762 employees,
consisting of approximately 10,928 in the United States and
approximately 1,797 in foreign countries. Approximately 37 of
our United States production and distribution employees in the
womenswear business are members of the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial & Textile Employees under an industry
association collective bargaining agreement, which our
womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations
with both our union and non-union employees to be good.



Executive Officers

The following are our current executive officers and their
principal business experience for the past five years.



SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Various statements in this Form 10-K or incorporated by
reference into this Form 10-K, in future filings by us with
the SEC, in our press releases and in oral statements made by or
with the approval of authorized personnel constitute
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and
are indicated by words or phrases such as
“anticipate,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “project,” “we believe,”
“is or remains optimistic,” “currently
envisions” and similar words or phrases and involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may
cause actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Some of the factors that could affect our financial
performance or cause actual results to differ from our estimates
in, or underlying, such forward-looking statements are set forth
under the heading of “Risk Factors.” Forward-looking
statements include statements regarding, among other items:

These forward-looking statements are based largely on our
expectations and are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual
results could differ materially from these forward-looking
statements as a result of, among others, changes in the
competitive marketplace, including the introduction of new
products or pricing changes by our competitors, changes in the
economy, and other events leading to a reduction in
discretionary consumer spending. We undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. In light of these risks and uncertainties, we cannot
assure you that the forward-looking information contained in
this Form 10-K will in fact transpire.



RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors should be read carefully in
connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking
statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the
following risks could materially adversely affect our business,
our operating results, our financial condition and the actual
outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are
made in this report.

Risks Related to Our Business

The loss of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or other
key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing
and operational areas of our business has been a critical
element of our success. The loss of his services, or any
negative market or industry perception with respect to him or
arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on
our business. Our other executive officers and other members of
senior management have substantial experience and expertise in
our business and have made significant contributions to our
growth and success. The unexpected loss of services of one or
more of these individuals could also adversely affect us. We are
not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life
insurance covering Mr. Lauren, our other executive officers
and certain other members of senior management. We have entered
into employment agreements with Mr. Lauren and several
other of our executive officers.

A substantial portion of our net sales and gross profit is
derived from a small number of department store customers.

Several of our department store customers, including some under
common ownership, account for significant portions of our
wholesale net sales. We believe that a substantial portion of
sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing
partners, including sales made by our sales force of Ralph
Lauren Home products, are also made to our largest department
store customers. Our three most significant department store
customers accounted for 51.1% of our wholesale net sales during
Fiscal 2005, while our ten largest customers accounted for
approximately 64.6% of our wholesale net sales during Fiscal
2005. The department store sector is undergoing consolidation.
Two of our largest wholesale customers, Federated Department
Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company have entered
into a merger agreement and have stated that they expect to
close the merger in the third quarter of 2005.

We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our
customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
commitments with our customers for each of our lines every
season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores
or any other significant customer, whether motivated by
competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our
licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business
with us or our licensing partners, could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See
“BUSINESS — Operations — Customers and
Service.”

Our business could be negatively impacted by any financial
instability of our customers.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department
stores across the United States and Europe and extend credit
based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial
condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the
financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail
business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk
relating to that customer’s receivables. Three of our
customers, Dillard Department Stores, Inc., Federated Department
Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company, in aggregate
constituted 44.9% of trade accounts receivable outstanding at
April 2, 2005. As noted above, Federated Stores, Inc. and
The May Department Stores Company have agreed to merge. Our
inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any
one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business or financial condition. See
“BUSINESS — Credit Control.”



Our business could suffer as a result of a
manufacturer’s inability to produce our goods on time and
to our specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend
upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all of our
products. Our products are manufactured to our specifications
primarily by international manufacturers. During Fiscal 2005,
less than 2%, by dollar value, of our men’s and
women’s products were manufactured in the United States and
over 98%, by dollar value, of these products were manufactured
in Asia and other countries. The inability of a manufacturer to
ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our
quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date
requirements of our customers for those items, which could
result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries
or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations.

Our business could suffer if we need to replace
manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the production capacity of
our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these
competitors have greater financial and other resources than we
have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for
production and import quota capacity. If we experience a
significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party
manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional
capacity will be available when required on terms that are
acceptable to us. See “BUSINESS — Sourcing,
Production and Quality.” We enter into a number of purchase
order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery,
method of payment, design and quality specifications and other
standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term
contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we
use produce our products exclusively.

Our business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails
to use acceptable labor practices.

Two of the manufacturers engaged by us accounted for
approximately 17% and 9% of our total production during Fiscal
2005. The primary production facilities of these two
manufacturers are located in Asia. We require our licensing
partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and
vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices
and our staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of
our independent manufacturers, we do not control these
manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor
or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one
of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent
manufacturer’s or licensing partner’s labor practices
from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States,
could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished
products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn,
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Our business is subject to risks associated with importing
products.

As of April 2, 2005, we source a significant portion of our
products outside the United States through arrangements with
over 270 foreign vendors in various countries. In Fiscal 2005,
approximately 98%, by dollar volume, of our products were
produced outside the U.S. primarily in Asia, Europe and
South America. Risks inherent in importing our products include:



Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. See
“BUSINESS — Sourcing, Production and
Quality.”

We are dependent upon the revenue generated by our licensing
alliances.

Approximately 53.2% of our income from operations for Fiscal
2005 was derived from licensing revenue received from our
licensing partners. Approximately 33.5% of our licensing revenue
for Fiscal 2005 was derived from three licensing partners.
WestPoint Stevens, Inc., Impact21 and Jones Apparel Group, Inc.
accounted for 14.2%, 12.1% and 7.2%, respectively. See
“— Risks Related to our Business — An
adverse result in the lawsuit that Jones filed against the
Company could have a material effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.” In June 2003, one of
our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens, Inc. and certain of
its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
code. WestPoint Stevens, Inc. produces bedding and bath products
for our Home Collection. On December 19, 2003, the United
States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement
between WestPoint Stevens, Inc. and us. The amended agreement
provides for the same royalty rate and minimum royalties that
are not materially less than the previous agreement.

We had no other licensing partner which accounted for more than
10% of our licensing revenue in Fiscal 2005. The interruption of
the business of any one of our material licensing partners due
to any of the factors discussed immediately below could also
adversely affect our licensing revenues and net income.

We rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of
our licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our
licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks
specific to a licensing partner’s business, including, for
example, risks associated with a particular licensing
partner’s ability to:

Although some of our license agreements prohibit licensing
partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our
competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded
from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered
by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of
sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are
also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
control over our licensing partners’ products and
advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other
things, operational and financial control over their businesses.



Failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our
business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we could replace
existing licensing partners if necessary, our inability to do so
for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both
directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
from reduced sales of our other products. See
“Operations — Our Licensing Alliances.”

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not
be adequately protected outside the United States.

We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are
important to our success and our competitive position. We devote
substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our
trademarks on a worldwide basis. In the course of our
international expansion, we have, however, experienced conflicts
with various third parties that have acquired or claimed
ownership rights in some trademarks that include Polo and/or a
representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise
have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past
successfully resolved these conflicts through both legal action
and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a
material impact on our financial condition and results of
operations. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that the actions
we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other
proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our
products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block
sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and
proprietary rights of others. Also, we cannot assure you that
others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks
and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to
successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries
may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. See “Trademarks,” and
Item 3 “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.”

We cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth
strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands,
expand our geographic coverage, increase direct management of
our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically
acquiring select licensees and enhancing our operations.
Implementation of our strategy involves the continued expansion
of our business in Europe, Asia and other international areas.
We may have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified key
employees or otherwise successfully managing such expansion. In
addition, Europe, as a whole, lacks the large wholesale
distribution channels found in the United States, and we may
have difficulty developing successful distribution strategies
and alliances in each of the major European countries.

Implementation of our strategy also involves the continued
expansion of our network of retail stores, both in the United
States and abroad. We may not be able to purchase or lease
desirable store locations or renew existing store leases on
acceptable terms. Furthermore, we may not be able to
successfully integrate the business of any licensee that we
acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost
savings or synergies from such integration.

Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency
fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars.
However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result,
the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the
value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency denominated prices at which our international
businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales
and licensing revenue generally is derived from sales in foreign
currencies. These foreign currencies include the Japanese Yen,
the Euro and the Pound Sterling, and this revenue could be
materially affected by currency fluctuations. Approximately
40.9% of our licensing revenue was received from international
licensing partners in Fiscal 2005. Although we hedge some
exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising
in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure you that
foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See
Item 7 “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS —
Liquidity and Capital Resources.”



Our ability to conduct business in international markets may
be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets
and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing
international markets is subject to risks associated with
international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets.

We are also subject to general political and economic risks in
connection with our international operations, including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other
similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States, the
European Union, Japan, or other countries upon the import or
export of our products in the future, or what effect any of
these actions would have on our business, financial condition or
results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical
policies and other factors may adversely affect our business in
the future or may require us to modify our current business
practices.

An adverse result in the lawsuit that Jones filed against the
Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

As a result of the failure of Jones to meet the minimum sales
volumes for the year ended December 31, 2002 under the
license agreements for the sale of products under the
“Ralph” trademark between us and Jones, these license
agreements terminated as of December 31, 2003. We advised
Jones that the termination of these licenses would automatically
result in the termination of the licenses between us and Jones
with respect to the “Lauren” trademark pursuant to the
Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement between the Company
and Jones dated May 11, 1998. The Lauren license agreements
would otherwise have expired on December 31, 2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit against us in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York alleging, among other
things, that we breached our agreements with Jones with respect
to the “Lauren” trademark by asserting our rights
pursuant to the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement, and
that we induced Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the former President
of Jones, to breach the non-compete and confidentiality clauses
in Ms. Nemerov’s employment agreement with Jones.
Jones stated that it would treat the Lauren license agreements
as terminated as of December 31, 2003, and is seeking
compensatory damages of $550.0 million, punitive damages
and enforcement of the provisions of Ms. Nemerov’s
agreement. Also on June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against
Jones in the Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking,
among other things, an injunction and a declaratory judgement
that the Lauren license agreements terminated as of
December 31, 2003 pursuant to the terms of the Cross
Default and Term Extension Agreement. The two lawsuits have been
consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to dismiss Jones’
claims regarding breach of the “Lauren” agreements and
a motion to stay the claims regarding Ms. Nemerov pending
the arbitration of Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On
July 23, 2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgement
in our action against Jones, and on August 12, 2003, we
filed a cross-motion for summary judgement. On March 18,
2004, the Court entered orders (i) denying our motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims against us for breach of the Lauren
agreements and (ii) granted Jones’ motion for summary
judgement in our action for declaratory judgement the Lauren
Agreements terminated on December 31, 2003 and dismissed
our complaint. The order also stayed Jones’ claim against
us relating to Ms. Nemerov pending arbitration regarding
her alleged breach of her employment



agreement. On August 24, 2004, the Court denied our motion
to reconsider its decision and we appealed the orders.

On March 24, 2005, the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court affirmed the lower Court’s orders. On April 22,
2005, we filed a motion with the Appellate Division for
reargument and/or permission to appeal its decision to the New
York Court of Appeals. On June 23, 2005, the Appellate
Division denied our request for reargument, but granted our
motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. If the Court
of Appeals does not reverse the Appellate Division’s
decision, the case will go back to the lower Court for a trial
on damages. Although we intend to continue to defend the case
vigorously, in light of the Appellate Division’s decision
we recorded a reserve of $100.0 million during Fiscal 2005,
which reduced Fiscal 2005 Income from operations from
$399.7 million to $299.7 million. This charge
represents management’s best estimate at this time of the
loss incurred. No discovery has been held, and the ultimate
outcome of this matter could differ materially from the reserved
amount.

Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete

We face intense competition in the worldwide apparel
industry.

We face a variety of competitive challenges from other domestic
and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual apparel
producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more
diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources
than we have. We compete with these companies primarily on the
basis of:

We also face competition from companies selling apparel and home
products through the Internet. Although our Ralph Lauren Media,
LLC joint venture does sell our products through the internet,
increased competition in the worldwide apparel, accessories and
home product industries from Internet-based competitors could
reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our
results of operations.

The success of our business depends on our ability to respond
to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate
and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as
to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of
consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty
and are subject to rapid change. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the
future. In addition, we cannot assure you that any new products
or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by
consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and
respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion
trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of
our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold
inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be
forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of
excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business. At
the same time, our focus on tight management of inventory may
result, from time to time, in our not having an adequate



supply of products to meet consumer demand and cause us to lose
sales. See “BUSINESS — Sourcing, Production and
Quality.”

A downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of
discretionary items and luxury retail products, which could
adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many factors
affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel, cosmetic,
fragrance and home products industries, including, among others:

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail
products, including our products, may decline during
recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income
is lower. A downturn in the economies in which we, or our
licensing partners, sell our products, may adversely affect our
revenues. The current economic conditions have and may continue
to adversely affect consumer spending and sales of our products.

Our business could suffer as a result of consolidations,
restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail
industry.

In recent years, the retail industry has experienced significant
consolidation and other ownership changes. Two of our largest
customers, Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May
Department Stores Company have agreed to merge. Some of our
customers have operated under the protection of the federal
bankruptcy laws. In the future, retailers in the United States
and in foreign markets may undergo changes that could decrease
the number of stores that carry our products or increase the
ownership concentration within the retail industry, including:

While to date these changes in the retail industry have not had
a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition, our business could be materially affected by these
changes in the future. See “— Risks Related to
Our Business — A substantial portion of our net sales
and gross profit is derived from a small number of department
store customers.”

Item 2.

Properties

Our distribution and administrative functions are conducted in
both leased and owned facilities. We also lease space for our
retail and outlet stores, showrooms, and warehouse and office
space in various domestic and international locations. We do not
own any real property except for our distribution facility in
Greensboro, North Carolina and a parcel of land adjacent to the
facility, and Polo Ralph Lauren stores in Southampton, New York
and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

Ralph Lauren Media has entered into an agreement with
ValueVision to perform its entire warehousing and order
fulfillment and call center functions. ValueVision, which
operates ShopNBC, and the National Broadcasting Company are our
joint venture partners in Ralph Lauren Media.



The following table sets forth information with respect to our
key properties:

The leases for our non-retail facilities (approximately 41 in
all) provide for aggregate annual rentals of approximately
$30.6 million in Fiscal 2005. In addition, we have entered
into an agreement to lease additional 153,000 sq. ft.
at 625 Madison Avenue, New York, NY. We anticipate that we
will be able to extend those leases which expire in the near
future on terms satisfactory to us or locate substitute
facilities on acceptable terms.

As of April 2, 2005, the Company operated 278 retail
stores, totaling 2.16 million square feet. Aggregate annual
rentals for retail space in Fiscal 2005 totaled approximately
$97.2 million. We anticipate that we will be able to extend
those leases which expire in the near future on satisfactory
terms or relocate to desirable locations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel Group, Inc.
(including its subsidiaries, “Jones”) to meet the
minimum sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2002
under the license agreements for the sale of products under the
“Ralph” trademark between us and Jones dated
May 11, 1998, these license agreements terminated as of
December 31, 2003. We advised Jones that the termination of
these license agreements would automatically result in the
termination of the license agreements between us and Jones with
respect to the “Lauren” trademark pursuant to the
Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement between us and Jones
dated May 11, 1998. The terms of the Lauren license
agreements would otherwise have expired on December 31,
2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit against us in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York alleging, among other
things, that we had breached the Lauren license agreements by
asserting our rights under the Cross Default and Term Extension
Agreement, and that we induced Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the
former President of Jones, to breach the non-compete and
confidentiality clauses in Ms. Nemerov’s employment
agreement with Jones. Jones stated that it would treat the
Lauren license agreements as terminated as of December 31,
2003, and is seeking compensatory damages of
$550.0 million, punitive damages and enforcement of
Ms. Nemerov’s agreement. Also on June 3, 2003, we
filed a lawsuit against Jones in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York seeking, among other things, an injunction and a
declaratory judgement that the Lauren license agreements would
terminate as of December 31, 2003 pursuant to the terms of
the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement. The two lawsuits
were consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to dismiss Jones’
claims regarding breach of the “Lauren” agreements and
a motion to stay the claims regarding Ms. Nemerov pending
the arbitration of Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On
July 23, 2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgement
in our action against Jones, and on August 12, 2003, we
filed a cross-motion for summary judgement. On March 18,
2004, the Court entered orders (i) denying our motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims against us for breach of the Lauren
agreements and (ii) granting Jones’ motion for summary
judgement in our action for declaratory judgement that the
Lauren agreements terminated on December 31, 2003 and
dismissing our complaint. The order also stayed Jones’



claim against us relating to Ms. Nemerov pending
arbitration regarding her alleged breach of her employment
agreement. On August 24, 2004, the Court denied our motion
to reconsider its orders, and we appealed the orders.

On March 24, 2005, the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court affirmed the lower court’s orders. On April 22,
2005, we filed a motion with the Appellate Division for
reargument and/or permission to appeal its decision to the New
York Court of Appeals. On June 23, 2005, the Appellate
Division denied our request for reargument, but granted our
motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. If the Court
of Appeals does not reverse the Appellate Division’s
decision, the case will go back to the lower court for a trial
on damages. Although we intend to continue to defend the case
vigorously, in light of the Appellate Division’s decision
we recorded a reserve of $100.0 million during Fiscal 2005.
This charge represents management’s best estimate at this
time of the loss incurred. No discovery has been held, and the
ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from the
reserved amount.

As described in more detail in Note 20 to our consolidated
financial statements included in this form 10-K, we are
subject to various claims relating to allegations of a security
breach of our retail point of sale system, including fraudulent
credit card charges, the cost of replacing cards and related
monitoring expenses and other related claims. The Company is
unable to predict whether further claims will be asserted. The
Company has contested and will continue to vigorously contest
the claims made against it and continues to explore its defenses
and possible claims against others. The Company has recorded a
reserve of $6.2 million representing management’s best
estimate of the loss incurred in the fourth quarter of Fiscal
2005 relating to this matter. The ultimate outcome of these
matters could differ from the amounts recorded. While that
difference could be material to the results of operations for
any affected reporting period, it is not expected to have a
material impact on consolidated liquidity.

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of the
Company’s stores filed a lawsuit against us and our Polo
Retail, LLC subsidiary in the United States District Court for
the District of Northern California alleging violations of
California antitrust and labor laws. The plaintiff purports to
represent a class of employees who have allegedly been injured
by a requirement that certain retail employees purchase and wear
Company apparel as a condition of their employment. The
complaint, as amended, seeks an unspecified amount of actual and
punitive damages, disgorgement of profits and injunctive and
declaratory relief. The Company answered the amended complaint
on November 4, 2002. A hearing on cross motions for summary
judgement on the issue of whether the Company’s policies
violated California law took place on August 14, 2003. The
Court granted partial summary judgement with respect to certain
of the plaintiff’s claims, but concluded that more
discovery was necessary before it could decide the key issue as
to whether the Company had maintained for a period of time a
dress code policy that violated California law. The parties are
engaged in settlement discussions, and during Fiscal 2005 we
recorded a reserve for our estimate of the settlement cost, the
amount of which is not material.

On April 14, 2003, a second putative class action was filed
in the San Francisco Superior Court. This suit, brought by
the same attorneys, alleges near identical claims to those in
the federal class action. The class representatives consist of
former employees and the plaintiff in the federal court action.
Defendants in this class action include us and our subsidiaries
Polo Retail, LLC, Fashions Outlet of America, Inc., Polo Retail,
Inc. and San Francisco Polo, Ltd. as well as a
non-affiliated corporate defendant and two current managers. As
in the federal action, the complaint seeks an unspecified amount
of actual and punitive restitution of monies spent, and
declaratory relief. The state court class action has been stayed
pending resolution of the federal class action.

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit against the United
States Polo Association Inc., Jordache, Ltd. and certain other
entities affiliated with them, alleging that the defendants were
infringing on our trademarks. In connection with this lawsuit,
on July 19, 2001, the United States Polo Association and
Jordache filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. This suit,
which was effectively a counterclaim by them in connection with
the original trademark action, asserts claims related to our
actions in our pursuit of claims against the United States Polo
Association and Jordache for trademark infringement and other
unlawful conduct. Their claims stemmed from our contacts with
the United States



Polo Association’s and Jordache’s retailers in which
we informed these retailers of our position in the original
trademark action. All claims and counterclaims have now been
settled, except for the Company’s claims that the
defendants violated the Company’s trademark rights. We did
not pay any damages in this settlement. On July 30, 2004,
the Court denied all motions for summary judgement and set a
trial date for October 3, 2005.

On December 5, 2003, United States Polo Association, USPA
Properties, Inc., Global Licensing Sverige and Atlas Design AB
(collectively, “USPA”) filed a Demand for Arbitration
against the Company in Sweden under the auspices of the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution seeking a
declaratory judgement that USPA’s so-called Horseman symbol
does not infringe on Polo Ralph Lauren’s trademark and
other rights. No claim for damages was stated. On
February 19, 2004, we answered the Demand for Arbitration,
contesting the arbitrability of USPA’s claim for
declaratory relief. We also asserted our own counterclaim,
seeking a judgement that the USPA’s Horseman symbol
infringes on our trademark and other rights. We also sought
injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. On
November 1, 2004, the panel of the International Centre for
Dispute Resolution hearing the arbitration between us and the
United States Polo Association, United States Polo Association
Properties, Inc., Global Licensing Sverige and Atlas Design AB
(collectively, “USPA”) in Sweden rendered a decision
rejecting the relief sought by USPA and holding that their
so-called Horseman symbol infringes on our trademark and other
rights. The arbitral tribunal awarded us damages in excess of
3.5 million Swedish Krona, or $0.5 million based on
the exchange rate at April 2, 2005, and ordered USPA to
discontinue the sale of, and destroy all remaining stock of,
clothing bearing its Horseman symbol in Sweden. This award will
be recorded when received.

On October 29, 2004, we filed a demand for arbitration
against the United States Polo Association and United States
Polo Association Polo Properties, Inc. in the United Kingdom
under the auspices of the International Centre for Dispute
Resolution seeking a judgement that the Horseman symbol
infringes on our trademark and other rights, as well as
injunctive relief. Subsequently, the United States Polo
Association and United States Polo Association Properties, Inc.
agreed not to distribute products bearing the Horseman symbol in
the United Kingdom or any other member nation of the European
Community. Consequently, we withdrew our arbitration demand on
December 7, 2004.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims
involving trademark and intellectual property, licensing,
employee relations and other matters incidental to our business.
We believe that the resolution of these other matters currently
pending will not individually or in aggregate have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended April 2, 2005.



PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrants’ Common Equity and Related
    Stockholders Matters

Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “RL.” The following table
sets forth the high and low closing prices per share of the
Class A common stock for each quarterly period in our two
most recent fiscal years, as reported on the NYSE Composite Tape.

On May 20, 2003 our Board of Directors initiated a regular
quarterly cash dividend program of $0.05 per share, or
$0.20 per share on an annual basis, on our Class A
common stock. Approximately $20.4 million was recorded as a
reduction to retained earnings during Fiscal 2005 in connection
with these dividends.

As of June 10, 2005, there were 1,428 holders of record of
our Class A common stock and 11 holders of record of our
Class B common stock. All of our outstanding shares of
Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren and
related entities and are convertible at any time into shares of
Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and may not be
transferred to anyone other than affiliates of Mr. Lauren.

The Company has two Class A stock repurchase plans. The
    initial plan was first publicly announced in March 1998, and the
    extension of this Plan thru April 1, 2006 was announced on
    May 26, 2004. Approximately $22.5 million in shares
    may yet be repurchased under this plan. The second plan was
    first publicly announced on February 2, 2005. This plan
    provides for the repurchase of up to an additional
    $100 million of Class A Common stock. No repurchases
    have been made under this plan, which does not have a
    termination date.



Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The table below provides selected consolidated financial data
for each of our last five fiscal years. We derived the income
statement data for each of our last three fiscal years in the
period ended April 2, 2005 and the balance sheet data as of
April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004 from our consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are
included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and
were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent
registered public accounting firm. The information for the
fiscal years ended April 3, 2004, March 29, 2003,
March 30, 2002 and March 31, 2001 has been restated to
reflect certain lease accounting and other corrections as well
as the consolidation of Ralph Lauren Media beginning in Fiscal
2004 (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report). You should read this
consolidated financial data together with our consolidated
financial statements and the notes to those financial statements
as well as the discussion in this Form 10-K under the

Effective December 31, 2001, for reporting purposes the
    Company changed the fiscal year ends of its European
    subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial
    statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform
    with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of
    the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on a
    three-month lag with a fiscal year ending December 31.
    Accordingly, the net activity shown below for the three-month
    period ended December 29, 2001, for those European
    subsidiaries is reported as an adjustment to Retained earnings

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis is a summary and should be
read together with our consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes, which are included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. We use a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on
the Saturday nearest March 31. References to “Fiscal
2005” represent the 52-week fiscal year ended April 2,
2005. References to “Fiscal 2004” represent the
53-week fiscal year ended April 3, 2004, and references to
“Fiscal 2003” represent the 52-week fiscal year ended
March 29, 2003.

Overview

We operate in three integrated segments: wholesale, retail and
licensing.

Wholesale consists of women’s, men’s and
children’s apparel. Teams comprising design, merchandising,
sales and production staff work together to develop product
groupings that are organized to convey a variety of design
concepts. This segment includes the Polo Ralph Lauren product
lines as well as Lauren, Blue Label, Polo Golf, RLX Polo Sport,
Women’s Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label, and
Men’s Purple Label Collection.

Retail consists of our worldwide Ralph Lauren retail operations
that sell our product through Ralph Lauren, Club Monaco
full-price and outlet stores and Rugby full-price stores as well
as Ralph Lauren Media, our 50% owned e-commerce joint venture,
which sells product over the Internet.

Licensing consists of product, international and home licensing
alliances, each of which pay us royalties based upon sales of
our product, and are generally subject to minimum royalty
payments. We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure
that products are developed, marketed and distributed in a
manner consistent with the distinctive perspective and lifestyle
associated with our brand.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements

We have restated our prior years’ financial statements for
the following items.

As a result of the clarifications contained in the
February 7, 2005 letter from the Office of the Chief
Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) to the Center for Public Company Audit Firms
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
regarding certain specific lease accounting issues, we initiated
a review of the Company’s lease accounting practices.
Management and the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board
of Directors determined that our accounting practices were
incorrect with respect to rent holiday periods and the
classification of landlord incentives and the related
amortization. We have made all appropriate adjustments to
correct these errors for all periods presented.

In periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we had
recorded straight-line rent expense for store operating leases
over the related store’s lease term beginning with the
commencement date of store operations. Rent expense was not
recognized during any build-out period. To correct this
practice, we have adopted a policy in which rent expense is
recognized on a straight-line over the stores’ lease term
commencing with the start of the build-out period (the effective
lease-commencement date). The adoption of this policy resulted
in a reduction in operating income of $2.9 million for
Fiscal 2004 and a $2.4 million increase in operating income
for Fiscal 2003.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we had classified
tenant allowances (amounts received from a landlord to fund
leasehold improvement) as a reduction of property and equipment
rather than as a deferred lease incentive liability. The
amortization of these landlord incentives was originally
recorded as a reduction in depreciation expense rather than as a
reduction of rent expense. In addition, our statements of cash
flow had originally reflected these incentives as a reduction of
capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities
rather than as cash flows from operating activities. Correcting
these items resulted in an increase to each of net property and
equipment and deferred lease incentive liabilities of
$11.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively, at
April 3, 2004. Additionally, for each of the fiscal years
in the two-year period ended April 3, 2004, the
reclassification of the amortization of deferred lease
incentives resulted in a decrease to rent expense



and a corresponding increase to depreciation expense of
$2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. A
$5.5 million decrease was recorded to retained earnings as
of March 30, 2002 as a result of this restatement.

In January 2000, we formed Ralph Lauren Media, LLC as a joint
venture with the National Broadcasting Company. Under this
30-year joint venture agreement, Ralph Lauren Media is owned 50%
by the Company and 37.5% by NBC and 12.5% by ValueVision Media.
We had used the equity method of accounting for our investment
in the joint venture since its inception.

On December 24, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standard
Board (“FASB”) issued FIN 46R, which is
applicable for financial statements issued for reporting periods
ending after March 15, 2004. The Company considered the
provisions of FIN 46R in its fiscal 2004 financial
statements and made the determination that Ralph Lauren Media
was a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under
FIN 46R. At that time the Company also determined that it
was not the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R and,
therefore, was not required to consolidate the results of Ralph
Lauren Media. Upon subsequent review the Company has now
concluded that its determination in 2004 was incorrect and that
consolidation of Ralph Lauren Media into the Company’s
financial statements was required as of April 3, 2004. The
impact on the Company’s balance sheet as of April 3,
2004 is to increase assets by approximately $18 million and
liabilities by approximately $9 million and minority
interest by approximately $9 million. Previously, the
Company accounted for this joint venture using the equity method
of accounting, under which we recognized our share of Ralph
Lauren Media’s operating results based on our share of
ownership and the terms of the joint venture agreement. As a
result, there is no impact from the consolidation on prior
year’s reported earnings.

We also corrected the classification of the net loss recorded on
the disposal of property and equipment from the investing
activities section to the operating activities section within
the Statement of Cash Flows for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003.

Further, upon review of the Fiscal 2004 Statement of Cash Flows,
we concluded that certain foreign exchange results previously
classified as “Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and
cash equivalents and net investment in foreign
subsidiaries” should be classified as operating activities
and have made these corrections as part of the restatement.

See Notes 2 and 22 to our consolidated financial statements
included in this Form 10-K for a summary of the effects of
the restatements of previously issued financial statements to
reflect the above items. The accompanying Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations gives effect to these restatements.

Fiscal 2005 Overall Results

During Fiscal 2005, overall revenue increased
$655.8 million, or 24.7%, primarily as a result of the
acquisition of the Childrenswear business, the presence of the
Lauren line in our wholesale segment for a full year and strong
growth in our retail segment, partially offset by sales declines
in our Men’s wholesale business due to a planned reduction
in off price sales. Our licensing revenue decreased
$24.1 million, or 9.0%, as a result of loss of licensing
income from the Lauren and Childrenswear labels.

Gross profit increased $361.2 million, or 27.3%, and our
gross margin as a percentage of sales (gross margin rate)
increased to 51.0% from 49.9% in Fiscal 2004. The increasing
gross margin rate reflects the benefits of advertising, improved
product mix and a continued focus on inventory management,
partially offset by decreases in licensing income as a result of
the acquisition of the Lauren and Childrenswear lines.

Operating expenses increased $349.7 million or 33.9%,
primarily as a result of litigation charges recorded in the
amount of $106.2 million and the addition of expenses
associated with the Childrenswear business, a full year’s
expenses for the Lauren business and increased operating
expenses associated with our growth in retail sales.

During Fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring charges of
$2.3 million. These charges are primarily composed of
additional severance costs for the consolidation of our European
business.



Our international operating results were affected by foreign
exchange rate fluctuations. However, the increase in net sales
due to the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar was generally
offset by a comparable increase in cost of sales and operating
expenses.

Balance Sheet

Our financial position remains strong. Our cash and cash
equivalents decreased to $350.5 million and our cash and
cash equivalents net of debt position decreased
$15.5 million, primarily as a result of the purchase of the
Childrenswear business and an increase in our debt due to the
strengthening of the Euro. Cash flow from operations increased
by $168.4 million primarily as a result of increased sales
and gross profits. We intend to pay the approximately
$110 million purchase price for the pending purchase of our
footwear licensee out of our cash and cash equivalents.

Recent Developments

As described in Item 1 — BUSINESS —
“Recent Developments” and Item 3 —
“LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,” we have recorded a reserve of
$100.0 million in connection with our litigation with Jones
Apparel Group, Inc. over the termination of the Lauren product
line license previously held by Jones. On March 24, 2005,
the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed
the lower Court’s orders in favor of Jones. We filed a
motion with the Appellate Division for reargument and/or
permission to appeal its decision to the New York Court of
Appeals, and on June 23, 2005, the Appellate Division
denied our request for reargument but granted our motion for
leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. If the Court of Appeals
does not reverse the Appellate Division’s decision, the
case will go back to the lower court for a trial on damages.
Although we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously, in
light of the Appellate Division’s decision we recorded a
charge of $100.0 million during Fiscal 2005 to establish a
reserve for this litigation. This charge represents
management’s best estimate at this time of the loss
incurred. No discovery has been held, and the ultimate outcome
of this matter could differ materially from the reserved amount.
Jones is seeking compensatory damages of $550.0 million
plus punitive damages relating to our alleged tortuous
interference in the non-compete and confidentiality provisions
of Jackwyn Nemerov’s former employment agreement with
Jones. If Jones were to be awarded the full amount of damages it
seeks, the award would have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial position.

The royalties that we received pursuant to the
“Lauren” license agreements and “Ralph”
license agreements represented revenues of approximately
$23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in
Fiscal 2004 prior to the termination of these licenses on
December 31, 2003 and $37.4 million and
$5.3 million respectively during Fiscal 2003. In total,
royalties received from Jones (consisting solely of royalties
from the “Polo Jeans” license agreements, since the
termination of the Lauren and Ralph licenses), accounted for
7.2%, 17.2% and 27.2% of our aggregate licensing revenue for
Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively.

As described in more detail in Note 21 to our consolidated
financial statements included in this Form 10-K, we are
subject to various claims relating to an alleged security breach
of our retail point of sale system, including fraudulent credit
card charges, the cost of replacing cards and related monitoring
expenses and other related claims. We are unable to predict the
extent to which further claims will be asserted. We have
contested and will continue to vigorously contest the claims
made against it and continues to explore its defenses and
possible claims against others. We have established a reserve of
$6.2 million on its balance sheet relating to this matter,
representing management’s best estimate at this time of the
loss incurred. The ultimate outcome of this matter could differ
from the amounts recorded. While that difference could be
material to the results of operations for any affected reporting
period, it is not expected to have a material impact on
consolidated financial position or liquidity.

In June 2003, one of our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens,
Inc., and certain of its affiliates (“WestPoint”)
filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint
produces bedding and bath product in our Home Collection. On
December 19, 2003, the United States Bankruptcy Court
approved an amended licensing agreement between WestPoint and



us, which provides for the same royalty rate and minimum
royalties that are not materially lower than under the previous
agreement. On June 24, 2005, American Real Estate
Properties, LP, an entity controlled by investor Carl Icahn, won
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved bidding process for
WestPoint’s assets, subject to final confirmation at a
hearing to be held August 17, 2005. The Company believes
that the new owners will continue the relationship on
satisfactory terms. The contract with WestPoint Stevens expires
in December of 2005.

Recent Acquisitions

On May 23, 2005, the Company entered into a definitive
agreement with Reebok International, Ltd to acquire all the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren
Footwear Co., Inc, the global licensee for men’s,
women’s and children’s footwear, as well as certain
foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok International Ltd
(collectively, the “Footwear Business”). The purchase
price for the acquisition of the Footwear Business will be
approximately $110 million in cash payable at closing,
subject to certain closing adjustments. Payment of the purchase
price will be funded by cash on hand and lines of credit as
required. In addition, the Footwear Licensee and certain of its
affiliates have entered into a transition services agreement
with us to provide a variety of operational, financial and
information systems services over a period of twelve to eighteen
months. The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to
customary conditions, including the receipt of certain third
party consents and the expiration or termination of the waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976. The closing of the transaction is anticipated to
occur in July 2005.

On July 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of certain
assets of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC for a purchase price of
approximately $263.5 million including transaction costs.
The purchase price includes deferred payments of
$15 million over the next three years, and we have agreed
to assume certain liabilities. Additionally, we agreed to pay up
to an additional $5 million in contingent payments if
certain sales targets are attained. During the third quarter, we
recorded a $5 million liability for this contingent
purchase payment because we believe it is probable the sales
targets will be achieved. This amount was recorded as an
increase in goodwill. RL Childrenswear Company, LLC was our
licensee holding the exclusive licenses to design, manufacture,
merchandise and sell newborn, infant, toddler and girls and boys
clothing in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In connection
with this acquisition, we recorded fair values for assets and
liabilities as follows: inventory of $26.6 million,
property and equipment of $7.5 million, intangible assets,
consisting of non-compete agreements, valued at
$2.5 million and customer relationships, valued at
$29.9 million, other assets of $1.0 million, goodwill
of $208.3 million and liabilities of $12.3 million.

The results of operations for the Childrenswear line for the
period are included in the consolidated results of operations
commencing July 2, 2004, for the year ended April 2,
2005.

The following unaudited pro forma information assumes the
Childrenswear acquisition had occurred on March 30, 2003.
The pro forma information, as presented below, is not indicative
of the results that would have been obtained had the transaction
occurred March 30, 2003, nor is it indicative of the
Company’s future results. The unaudited pro forma
information is presented based on the preliminary purchase price
allocation. The final purchase price allocation and the
resulting effect on net income may differ significantly from the
unaudited pro forma amounts included herein (dollars in
thousands, except per share amounts).

The following pro forma amounts reflect adjustments for
purchases made by us from Childrenswear, licensing royalties
paid to us by Childrenswear, amortization of the non-compete
agreements, lost interest income on the cash used for the
purchase and the income tax effect based upon unaudited pro
forma effective tax rate of 35.5% in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal
2004. The unaudited pro forma information gives effect only to
adjustments described above and does not reflect
management’s estimate of any anticipated cost savings or
other benefits as a result of the acquisition. The unaudited pro
forma amounts include material non recurring charges of
approximately $7.4 million that are recorded within Cost of
goods sold related to the write up to fair value of inventory as
part of the preliminary purchase price allocation (dollars in
thousands, except per share amounts).

Restructurings

During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our
European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and
more efficiently consolidate our business operations. The major
initiatives of the plan included the following: consolidation of
our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one
location, the consolidation of our European logistics operations
to Italy and the migration of all European information systems
to a standard global system. In connection with the
implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a
restructuring charge of $2.1 million, $7.9 million and
$14.4 million during Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal
2003, respectively. $23.3 million had been paid through
April 2, 2005 in connection with this implementation. The
remaining balance which consists primarily of lease termination
costs will be paid over the life of the lease.

During Fiscal 2001, we implemented the 2001 Operational Plan.
Due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than
originally estimated, we recorded an additional
$10.4 million charge during Fiscal 2004. The remaining
balance which consists primarily of lease termination costs will
be paid over the life of the lease.

Results of Operations

The table below sets forth results in millions of dollars and
the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in
our consolidated statements of income for our last three fiscal
years:



Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Net Revenues.

Net revenues for Fiscal 2005 were
$3.3 billion, an increase of $655.8 million over net
revenues for Fiscal 2004. Wholesale revenues primarily increased
as a result of the sale of Lauren and Childrenswear products.
These increases were partially offset by decreased sales
elsewhere in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned
reductions in off price sales in our men’s, women’s
and European business as well as the loss of the Lauren and
Ralph royalties from Jones. The increase in net revenues was
also caused by increases in our retail segment as a result of
our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store
expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro.
Net revenues for our business segments are provided below
(Dollars in thousands).

    Childrenswear business and a full year without royalties from
    the Lauren licensee.

•

a $13.1 million increase in international licensing.



Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased $361.2 million,
or 27.3%, for Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004. Gross profit
as a percentage of net revenues increased to 51.0% from 49.9%
primarily as a result of improved margins in our wholesale and
retail businesses driven by reduced markdowns and our inventory
management initiatives. Partially offsetting these improvements
is the loss of licensing revenues from the Lauren and
Childrenswear lines.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

SG&A
increased $349.7 million, or 33.9%, to $1.383 billion
during Fiscal 2005 from $1.033 billion in Fiscal 2004.
SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 41.8% from
39.0%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by:

Restructuring Charge.

We recorded restructuring charges
of $2.3 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to
restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004.
The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge is primarily comprised of
additional contract termination and severance costs related to
the consolidation of our European business operations.

Income (Loss) from Operations.

Income from operations
increased $28.8 million, or 10.6%, in Fiscal 2005 compared
to Fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily driven by an
increase in wholesale and retail operating profits that was
partially offset by an increase in SG&A costs driven by the
items noted above. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in the licensing segment’s profits due to the loss
of the Lauren and Childrenswear royalties. Income from
operations was not significantly impacted by the stronger Euro
and Canadian dollar, because the increased sales resulting from
exchange rate fluctuations were substantially offset by a
comparable increase in expenses. Income from operations for our
business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands).

Wholesale operating income

increased primarily as
a result of incremental net sales in our newly acquired
Childrenswear business and a full year of activity in the Lauren
business.



Retail operating income

increased primarily as a
result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a
percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially
offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in
connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store
expansion.

Licensing income

decreased primarily due to the
loss of the Lauren and Childrens royalties. This decrease was
partially offset by improvements in our international licensing
business.

Unallocated Corporate Expenses

increased primarily
as a result of increased stock compensation expense and
increased bonus accrual resulting from our increased operating
income.

Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses.

The effect of foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain of
$6.1 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to a
$1.9 million loss during Fiscal 2004. These gains are
unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar
when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted
to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense, Net.

Interest expense decreased to
$6.4 million in Fiscal 2005 from $10.0 million for
Fiscal 2004. This decrease was due to the repayment of
approximately $100.0 million of short-term borrowings
during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a
result of the interest rate swaps described in “Liquidity
and Capital Resources — Derivative Instruments.”

Provision for Income Taxes.

The effective tax rate was
35.9% for Fiscal 2005, compared to 36.2% for Fiscal 2004.

Other Expense (Income), Net.

Other expense (income) net
was $1.6 million for Fiscal 2005. This reflects
$6.4 million of income related to our 20% equity interest
in Impact21, the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo
Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in
Japan, net of $3.8 million of minority interest expense
associated with our Japanese master license, both of which were
acquired in February 2003 (excluding the additional 2% equity
interest in the entity that holds the sublicenses that we
acquired in May 2003). Also included in Fiscal 2005 is
$4.2 million of minority interest expense for Ralph Lauren
Media.

Net Income.

Net income increased for Fiscal 2005 to
$190.4 million from $169.2 million for Fiscal 2004, or
5.8% and 6.4% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share
on a fully diluted basis increased by $0.15 to $1.83 per
share as a result of the increase in net income for the reasons
previously discussed partially offset by an increase in diluted
shares outstanding of 3.1 million due to the exercise of
stock options, a higher average stock price and the award of
restricted stock units to executives.

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

Net Revenues.

Net revenues for Fiscal 2004 were
$2.650 billion, an increase of $210.3 million over net
revenues for Fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to
increases in our retail segment as a result of our improved
comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the
favorable impact of the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar.
Also contributing to the sales increase was the 53rd week
in Fiscal 2004 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2003. The
53rd week was responsible for an estimated
$39.5 million of the sales increase. Further influencing
the increase in net revenues were overall increases in licensing
revenues driven by the incremental effect of the consolidation
of revenues from the Japanese master license and improved
results in the footwear business. Additionally, wholesale
revenues increased as a result of the sale of Lauren products
commencing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. These
increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our
wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off
price sales in our



men’s, women’s and European business as well as the
loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues
for our business segments are provided below (dollars in
thousands).

Retail net sales

increased primarily as a result
of:

•

a $43.7 million, or 14.4%, increase in comparable
    full-price store sales and a $48.8 million, or 7.6%,
    increase in comparable outlet store sales on a constant dollar
    basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable store
    sales increased 12.2% and 5.7% in full-price and outlet stores,
    respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales
    for the 53 weeks increased 18.0% and 8.8% for the full
    price stores and the outlet stores, respectively, while
    comparable store sales on a 52 week basis increased 15.8%
    for full price stores and 6.9% for outlet stores. Comparable
    store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and
    Club Monaco stores.

•

worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2004, the Company added
    15 stores and closed 7 stores. Our total store count at
    April 3, 2004 was 261 stores compared to 253 stores at
    March 29, 2003.

•

the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in the current period,
    accounted for approximately $27.0 million of the increase
    in net sales.

Licensing revenue

— the increase
primarily reflects:

•

a $27.5 million increase in international licensing
    primarily due to the incremental effect of the consolidation of
    revenues from the Japanese master license.

•

$3.5 million increase in domestic licensing due to
    improvements in the footwear business.

•

the loss of $15.8 million of Lauren and Ralph royalties
    from Jones compared to the prior year.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased $115.7 million,
or 9.6%, for Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as a
result of the increases discussed above. Gross profit as a
percentage of net revenues increased to 49.9% from 49.5%. This
increase reflects a change in business mix, with retail sales
representing 44.2% of revenues in Fiscal 2004 compared to 41.1%
in Fiscal 2003 and improved margins in our Ralph Lauren and Club
Monaco retail stores. The increasing gross profit rate also
reflects higher realized sales dollars resulting from a
combination of improved product mix as well as the benefits of
advertising and targeted marketing. The



rate improvement also reflects a continued focus on inventory
management. Although our inventory balance at April 2, 2005
is approximately the same as it was at April 3, 2004, this
primarily reflects the appreciation of the Euro, inventories
related to our Lauren wholesale business and increased levels of
inventory related to our retail growth offset by decreases in
inventory in other lines of business.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

SG&A
increased $130.6 million, or 14.5%, to $1.033 billion
during Fiscal 2004 from $902.3 million during Fiscal 2003.
SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 39.0% from
37.0%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by:

Restructuring Charge.

We recorded restructuring charges
of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to
restructuring charges of $14.4 million during Fiscal 2003.
The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charge is comprised of an
additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs
primarily associated with two Club Monaco retail properties
included in our 2001 Operational Plan due to real estate market
factors that were less favorable than originally estimated,
$7.9 million for additional contract termination and
severance costs related to the consolidation of our European
business operations (approximately $6.7 million for the
wholesale business and $1.2 million for the retail
business) and $1.3 million for lease termination and asset
write-offs associated with the March 2004 decision to close our
RRL stores. The Fiscal 2003 restructuring charge of
$14.4 million related to severance and contract termination
costs in connection with the consolidation of our European
business operations.

Income (Loss) from Operations.

Income from operations
decreased $20.0 million, or 6.9%, in Fiscal 2004 compared
to Fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease
in wholesale operating profits, restructuring charges, the
decrease in Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones following the
license termination in December 2003 and the start up expenses
associated with the Lauren line. These decreases were partially
offset by an increase in the retail segment’s profits.
Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the
stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004 because the
increased sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were
substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses.
Income from operations for our business segments are provided
below (Dollars in thousands).



Wholesale operating income

decreased primarily as
a result of decreased net sales in our domestic mens business
and European wholesale operations. The incremental effect of
Lauren sales in the fourth quarter on our wholesale
business’ income from operations was largely offset by
start up and ordinary operating expenses associated with the
Lauren wholesale business.

Retail operating income

increased primarily as a
result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a
percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially
offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in
connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store
expansion.

Licensing income

decreased primarily due to the
loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. This decrease
was partially offset by improvements in the footwear business
and by the inclusion of the operations of the Japanese Master
License.

Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses.

The effect of foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of
$1.9 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to a
$0.5 million loss during Fiscal 2003. These losses
primarily related to transaction losses on unhedged inventory
purchases and royalty payments in Europe resulting from
increases in the value of the Euro compared to the dollar. These
losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of
the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries
are converted to U.S. dollars. In the prior period, these
losses primarily related to transaction losses on the unhedged
portion of our Euro denominated debt caused by appreciation of
the Euro until we entered into the cross currency swap in June
2002, which were partially offset by $1.3 million of gains
recorded on the Japanese forward contracts that we entered into
in November of 2002.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased to
$10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 from $13.5 million for
Fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to the repayment of
approximately $100.0 million of short-term borrowings
during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a
result of the May 2003 interest rate swap described in
“Liquidity and Capital Resources —
Commitments — Derivative Instruments.”

Provision for Income Taxes.

The effective tax rate was
36.2% for Fiscal 2004 compared to 36.5% for Fiscal 2003.

Other (Income) Expense, Net.

Other (income) expense, net
was $(4.1) million for Fiscal 2004. This reflects
$5.5 million of income related to the 20% equity interest
in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph
Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in Japan, net
of $1.4 million of minority interest expense associated
with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in
February 2003 (except for the additional 2% equity interest in
the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May
2003).

Net Income.

Net income decreased for Fiscal 2004 to
$169.2 million from $175.7 million for Fiscal 2003, or
6.4% and 7.2% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share
on a fully diluted basis decreased by $0.09 to $1.68 per
share as a result of the decrease in net income for the reasons
previously discussed and an increase in diluted shares
outstanding of 1.7 million due to the exercise of stock
options, a higher average stock price and the award of
restricted stock units to executives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund growth in
working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventory) to
support projected sales increases, acquisitions, construction
and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in the
technological upgrading of our distribution centers and
information systems, expenditures related to retail store
expansion, acquisitions, dividends, and other corporate
activities. Sources of liquidity to fund ongoing and future cash
requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash
equivalents, credit facilities and other borrowings. We
anticipate funding the approximately $110 million purchase
price of the pending Footwear Business through the use of our
cash and cash equivalents.



Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

We ended Fiscal 2005 with $350.5 million in cash and cash
equivalents and $291.0 million of debt outstanding compared
to $352.3 million and $277.3 million of cash and cash
equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at April 3,
2004. This represents a $15.5 million decrease in our cash
net of debt position over the last twelve months which is
primarily attributable to the following factors: the use of
$241.9 million of cash to purchase the Childrenswear
business and an increase in Euro debt of $13.6 million as a
result of the strengthening of the Euro, partially offset by
increased cash flow from operations and increased proceeds
received from the exercise of stock options. Additionally,
capital expenditures were $174.1 million for Fiscal 2005
compared to $126.3 million in Fiscal 2004.

As of April 2, 2005, we had $291.0 million outstanding
in long-term Euro debt based on the year-end Euro exchange rate,
an increase of $13.6 million from Fiscal 2004. The increase
was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate.
We were also contingently liable for $29.8 million in
outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments
for the purchase of inventory. The weighted-average interest
rate on our borrowings at April 2, 2005 was 3.4%.

Accounts receivable increased $14.0 million primarily as a
result of the inclusion in Fiscal 2005 $30.4 million in
Childrenswear accounts receivable and a $7.4 million impact
of the strengthening Euro, partially offset by decreases in
accounts receivable in our Lauren and men’s divisions
resulting from the timing of payments.

Inventories increased $56.9 million in Fiscal 2005. The
inception of the Childrenswear line was responsible for a
$23.4 million increase, our men’s business had an
increase in inventory of $17.8 million, primarily as a
result of increased summer bookings. The strengthening of the
Euro caused a $6.7 million increase in inventory.

Accounts payable decreased $4.5 million compared to Fiscal
2004 primarily as result of a $12.7 million decrease in our
Lauren business, partially offset by increases in other areas.

Accrued expenses increased $129.1 million from Fiscal 2004,
primarily as a result of the accrual of $100.0 million for
a reserve relating to the Jones litigation as well as the
addition of the Childrenswear label and increases in Europe due
to the timing of year end invoice receipts.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net cash
provided by operating activities increased to
$382.0 million during Fiscal 2005 compared to
$213.6 million in Fiscal 2004. This $168.4 million
increase in cash flow was driven primarily by the year-over-year
increases in sales and gross profit.

During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our
European business and formalized our plans to centralize and
more efficiently consolidate our business operations. In
connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total
cash outlays of approximately $6.2 million during the year
ended April 2, 2005. We also had cash outlays of
$2.4 million during Fiscal 2005 in connection with our 2001
restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination
costs. It is expected that the remaining liabilities of both
plans will be paid accordance with contract terms.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net cash used in
investing activities was $417.4 million in Fiscal 2005, as
compared to $134.5 million in Fiscal 2004. Both the Fiscal
2005 and Fiscal 2004 net cash used primarily reflected
capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading
our systems and facilities, as well as shop-within-shop
expenditures. The Fiscal 2005 net cash used also reflects
$241.9 million for the purchase of our Childrenswear
business. Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2006
approximate $175 million.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.

Net cash
provided by financing activities was $31.5 million in
Fiscal 2005 compared to $76.4 million used in Fiscal 2004.
Cash provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2005,
consisted of the payment of $21.7 million in dividends,
offset by proceeds of $54.3 million from the exercise of
stock options. Cash used during Fiscal 2004 primarily consisted
of net repayment of short-term borrowings of $100.9 million
and the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially
offset by the $40.4 million of proceeds from the exercise
of stock options.



Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

We ended Fiscal 2004 with $352.3 million in cash and cash
equivalents and $277.3 million of debt outstanding compared
to $343.6 million and $349.4 million of cash and cash
equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at
March 29, 2003. This represents a $80.8 million
increase in our cash net of debt position over the last twelve
months which is primarily attributable to the following factors:
(i) reduced spending on acquisitions and investments,
(ii) increased proceeds received from the exercise of stock
options, (iii) partially offset by reduced cash flows from
operations and an increase in Euro debt of $28.9 million as
a result of the strengthening of the Euro. Additionally, capital
expenditures were $126.3 million for Fiscal 2004 compared
to $102.4 million in Fiscal 2003.

As of April 3, 2004, we had $277.3 million outstanding
in long-term Euro debt based on the year-end Euro exchange rate,
an increase of $28.9 million from Fiscal 2003. The increase
was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate.
We were also contingently liable for $35.3 million in
outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments
for the purchase of inventory. The weighted-average interest
rate on our borrowings at April 2, 2005 was 3.8%.

Accounts receivable increased $65.9 million primarily as a
result of the inception of sales under the Lauren label and the
strengthening of the Euro. $86.5 million of the increase
was due to Lauren and $13.2 million was due to the change
in the value of the Euro. These increases were partially offset
by decreases in accounts receivable in our other wholesale
divisions resulting from sales decreases and the timing of
payments.

Inventories decreased $9.4 million in Fiscal 2004. The
inception of the Lauren line was responsible for a
$34.1 million increase and the strengthening of the Euro
caused a $14.3 million increase in inventory. These
increases were more than offset by reductions in inventory in
our retail and Men’s wholesale business as a result of
improvements in our supply chain forecasting and management and
reduced inventory requirements in our men’s business as a
result of planned reductions in sales.

Other current assets increased $34.7 million from Fiscal
2003 primarily as a result of increases in European Value Added
Tax receivables and the effect of the timing of the fiscal year
end on prepaid items.

Accounts payable increased $7.5 million compared to Fiscal
2003 primarily as result of the addition of the Lauren line
partially offset by reductions in our men’s line due to a
decrease in inventory purchases and reductions in Europe due to
the timing of year end invoice receipts.

Accrued expenses increased $80.6 million primarily as a
result of the addition of the Lauren line, increases in the
European Value Added Tax payable, and increases in Europe due to
the timing of year end invoice receipts.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased to
$213.6 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to
$286.2 million in Fiscal 2003. This $72.6 million
decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by the year-over-year
changes in working capital described above and the decrease in
net income of $6.5 million.

During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our
European business and formalized our plans to centralize and
more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In
connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total
cash outlays of approximately $13.3 million during the year
ended April 3, 2004. We also had cash outlays of
$8.3 million during Fiscal 2004 in connection with our 2001
restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination costs.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net cash used in
investing activities was $134.5 million in Fiscal 2004, as
compared to $183.5 million in Fiscal 2003. Both the Fiscal
2004 and Fiscal 2003 net cash used primarily reflected
capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading
our systems and facilities, as well as shop-within-shop
expenditures. The Fiscal 2004 net cash used also reflects
$5.4 million for an additional 2% equity interest in
Impact21, the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo
Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in
Japan, and an additional $3.5 million primarily for
additional transaction costs to acquire a 50% interest in the
Japanese master license, offset by $8.9 million of cash
resulting from the



consolidation of RL Media, $1.0 million for an additional
payment on the first earn-out payment calculation in connection
with the PRL Fashions of Europe SRL acquisition and
$7.5 million for the acquisition in November 2003 of a
license for the use of trademarks. Fiscal 2003 net cash
used, reflects $78 million primarily for the acquisition of
a 50% interest in the Japanese Master license and an 18% equity
interest in Impact21, the company holding the sublicenses for
the Polo Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s, and jeans
business in Japan.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net cash used in
financing activities was $76.4 million in Fiscal 2004
compared to $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003. Cash used in
financing activities during Fiscal 2004, consisted of the net
repayment of short-term borrowings of $100.9 million and
the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset
by proceeds of $40.4 million from the exercise of stock
options. Cash used during Fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of net
repayments of borrowings of $19.7 million and repurchases
of common stock totaling $4.7 million, partially offset by
$7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Credit Facilities and Other

In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase,
subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of
our Class A common stock. Share repurchases were to be made
in the open market over a two-year period. The Board of
Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through
April 1, 2006. Shares acquired under the repurchase program
are used for stock option programs and for other corporate
purposes. As of April 2, 2005, we had repurchased
4.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at an
aggregate cost of $77.5 million. On February 1, 2005,
our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase
plan which allows for the repurchase of up to an additional
$100 million in our stock. No repurchases have been made
under this plan, which does not have a termination date.

In November 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of
6.125% notes due November 2006. Our Euro debt is listed on
the London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro
offering were $281.5 million, based on the Euro exchange
rate on the issuance date. Interest on the Euro debt is payable
annually. A portion of these net proceeds was used to acquire
Poloco S.A.S. (our principal European subsidiary), and the
remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate
purposes. Through Fiscal 2005, we had repurchased Euro
47.7 million, or $43.6 million, based on Euro exchange
rates at the time of repurchase of our outstanding Euro debt.

Prior to October 6, 2004, we had a credit facility with a
syndicate of banks consisting of a $300.0 million revolving
line of credit, subject to increase to $375.0 million,
which was available for direct borrowings and the issuance of
letters of credit. It was scheduled to mature on
November 18, 2005. On October 6, 2004, we, in
substance, expanded and extended this bank credit facility by
entering into a new credit agreement, dated as of that date,
with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, The Bank of
New York, Fleet National Bank, SunTrust Bank and Wachovia Bank
National Association, as Syndication Agents, J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., as sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger, and
a syndicate of lending banks that included each of the lending
banks under the prior credit agreement (the “New Credit
Facility”).

The New Credit Facility, which is otherwise substantially on the
same terms as the prior credit facility, provides for a
$450.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to
increase to $525.0 million, which is available for direct
borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It will mature
on October 6, 2009. As of April 2, 2005, we had no
direct borrowings outstanding under the New Credit Facility but
were contingently liable for $29.8 million in outstanding
letters of credit related primarily to commitments for the
purchase of inventory. We incur a financing charge of ten basis
points per month on the average monthly balance of these
outstanding letters of credit. Direct borrowings under the New
Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to
(i) the higher of (x) the weighted average overnight
Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, plus one-half of one percent, and (y) the prime
commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect from
time to time, or (ii) the LIBO Rate (as defined in the New
Credit Facility) in effect from time to time, as adjusted for
the Federal Reserve Board’s Eurocurrency Liabilities
maximum reserve percentage, and a margin based on our then
current credit ratings.



The New Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain
financial covenants, including:

•

a minimum ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
    Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (“EBITDAR”) to
    Consolidated Interest Expense (as such terms are described in
    the New Credit Facility); and

•

a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt (as defined in the New Credit
    Facility) to EBITDAR.

The New Credit Facility also contains covenants that, subject to
specified exceptions, restrict our ability to:

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit
Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the New
Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
immediately due and payable. The New Credit Facility specifies a
number of events of default (many of which are subject to
applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
covenants, including the financial covenants described above.
Additionally, the New Credit Facility provides that an event of
default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities
fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting
power of our common stock. As of April 2, 2005, the Company
was in compliance with all financial and non-financial debt
covenants.

In Fiscal 2003, the Board of Directors initiated a dividend
program consisting of quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per
outstanding share, or $0.20 per outstanding share on an
annual basis, on our common stock. Dividends of $0.05 per
outstanding share declared to stockholders of record at the
close of business on July 2, 2004, October 1, 2004,
December 20, 2004 and April 1, 2005 were paid on
July 16, 2004, October 15, 2004, January 14, 2005
and April 15, 2005, respectively.

We expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be
sufficient to fund our current level of operations, capital
requirements, cash dividends and our stock repurchase plan.
However, in the event of a material acquisition, material
contingencies or material adverse business developments, we may
need to draw on our credit facility or other potential sources
of borrowing.

As previously discussed, our ability to borrow under our credit
facility is subject to our maintenance of financial and other
covenants. As of April 2, 2005, we had no direct borrowings
under the credit facility and were in compliance with our
covenants.

With respect to pending or threatened litigation, the only
matter which could have a material adverse effect on our
liquidity and capital resources is the litigation with Jones
Apparel Group, Inc., in which Jones is seeking, among other
things, compensatory damages of $550 million and
unspecified punitive damages. See Item 3 —
“LEGAL PROCEEDINGS”. As noted above, we recorded a
reserve of $100 million in connection with this matter
during Fiscal 2005. We continue to believe that this matter is
unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or
capital resources or our ability to borrow under the credit
facility.

The long-term Euro debt cash obligation disclosed above includes
the principal amount and the interest payable at the 6.125%
fixed rate. We have entered into interest rate swaps, which
effectively convert the interest rate on an aggregate of Euro
205.2 million of the debt to a weighted average floating
rate equal to EURIBOR plus 0.738%. The remaining Euro
22.1 million of fixed rate debt (or such lesser amount
should any of the debt be repurchased) incurs interest of Euro
1.3 million per annum until the repayment date of the loan.

Derivative Instruments.

In June 2002, we entered into a
cross currency rate swap which was scheduled to terminate in
November 2006. The cross currency rate swap converted

€

105.2 million,
6.125% fixed rate borrowings into $100.0 million, LIBOR
plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the cross
currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations on both principal and interest payments on our
long-term Euro debt, and to minimize the impact of changes in
the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in LIBOR, the
benchmark interest rate. The swap was designated as a fair value
hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness was
measured as the difference between the respective gains or
losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value
of the cross currency rate swap and the Euro debt.

In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap and
entered into an interest rate swap that will terminate in
November 2006. The interest rate swap is being used to convert

€

105.2 million,
6.125% fixed rate borrowings into

€

105.2 million,
EURIBOR minus 1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into
the interest rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the
fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the
benchmark interest rate. The swap had been designated as a fair
value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness
is measured as the difference between the respective gains or
losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value
of the interest rate swap and the Euro debt resulting from
changes in the benchmark interest rate, and was de minimis for
Fiscal 2005. In addition, we have designated the entire
principal of the Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a
foreign subsidiary. As a result, changes in the fair value of
the Euro debt resulting from changes in the Euro rate are
reported net of income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive
income in the consolidated financial statements as an unrealized
gain or loss on foreign currency hedges. On April 6, 2004
and October 4, 2004, we executed additional interest rate
swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on an additional Euro
100 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate (EURIBOR
based). After the execution of these swaps, approximately Euro
22 million of the Eurobonds remained at a fixed interest
rate.

We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges
relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce our risk
from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory and intercompany
royalty payments. Gains and losses on these contracts are
deferred and recognized as adjustments to either the basis of
those assets or foreign exchange gains/losses, as applicable. At
April 2, 2005, we had the following foreign exchange
contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver Euro
94.3 million in exchange for $124.3 million through
Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 11,389 million
Japanese Yen in exchange for $99.6 million through Fiscal
2008. At April 2, 2005, the



fair value of these contracts resulted in unrealized gain and
loss, net of taxes of $1.8 million and $8.2 million,
for the Euro forward contracts and Japanese Yen forward
contracts, respectively.

To the extent that any derivative instruments do not qualify for
hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, they are recorded
at fair value, with all gains or losses recognized immediately
in the current period earnings. In November 2002, we entered
into forward contracts on 6.2 billion Japanese Yen that
terminated in February 2003. While these transactions did not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, we
entered into these forward contracts to minimize the impact of
foreign exchange fluctuations on the Japanese Yen denominated
purchase price described in the agreements related to the
purchase of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an
18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses
for the Polo Ralph Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans
business in Japan, which were consummated during the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2003. We recognized $2.4 million of
foreign currency gains on this transaction, which are recorded
in foreign currency (gains) losses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

We recognize gains or losses in connection with our foreign
currency contracts when the cash flows they hedge take place. We
recognized $10.9 million in forward losses in Fiscal 2005,
and $1.9 million in Fiscal 2004 in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. These charges are recorded as components
of cost of sales and royalty expense in the Consolidated
statement of income.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

We do not have any
off-balance sheet financing arrangements or unconsolidated
special purpose entities.

Seasonality of Business

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels
of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher
retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends
result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments
to retail customers and key vacation travel and holiday shopping
periods in the retail segment. As a result of the growth in our
retail operations and other changes in our business, historical
quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may
not be indicative of future performances. In addition,
fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter
may be affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments
and other events affecting retail sales.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting
policies employed by the Company, including the use of
estimates, are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical accounting policies are those that are most important
to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and
the results of operations, and require management’s most
difficult, subjective and complex judgements as a result of the
need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain. The Company’s most critical
accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to revenue
recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other
long-lived intangible assets, income taxes, accrued expenses and
derivative instruments. In applying such policies, management
must use some amounts that are based upon its informed
judgements and best estimates. Estimates, by their nature, are
based on judgements and available information. The estimates
that we make are based upon historical factors, current
circumstances and the experience and judgement of our
management. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an
ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our
evaluations.

Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate future
information, may affect amounts reported in future periods. We
are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
which would result in different amounts being reported that
would materially affect our financial condition or results of
operations.



Revenue Recognition

Revenue within our wholesale operations is recognized at the
time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers.
Wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns, discounts,
allowances and operational chargebacks. Returns and allowances
require pre-approval from management. Discounts are based on
trade terms. Estimates for end-of-season allowances are based on
historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current
economic conditions and retailer performance.

We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis based
on current experience, trends and retailer performance. Our
historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
from actual results. Retail store revenue is recognized net of
estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers. Licensing
revenue is initially recorded based upon contractually
guaranteed minimum levels and adjusted as actual sales data is
received from licensees. During the year ending April 2,
2005 and April 3, 2004, we reduced revenues and credited
customer accounts for end of season customer allowances,
operational chargebacks and returns as follows:

Our provisions and write offs against the reserves offsetting
accounts receivable increased in fiscal 2005 due to the large
increase in wholesale sales and the promotional retail
environment. Ending reserve balances have increased for
substantially the same reasons.

We require that a store be open a full fiscal year before we
include it in the computation of same store sales change. Stores
that are closed during the fiscal year are excluded. Stores that
are relocated or enlarged are also excluded until they have been
in their new location for a full fiscal year.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” In accordance with
SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
as measured by statutory tax rates that are expected to be in
effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and
liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant
judgement is required in determining the worldwide provisions
for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business,
there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome
is uncertain. It is our policy to establish provisions for taxes
that may become payable in future years as a result of an
examination by tax authorities. We established the provisions
based upon management’s assessment of exposure associated
with permanent tax differences and tax credits. The tax
provisions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as
events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions.

Accounts Receivable, Net

In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our
wholesale customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria.
Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, is net of the following allowances and reserves.

An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through
analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, assessments of collectibility
based on an evaluation of historic and anticipated trends, the
financial condition of the Company’s customers, and an
evaluation of the



impact of economic conditions. Expenses of $6.0 million
were recorded as an allowance for uncollectible accounts during
fiscal 2005. The amounts written off against customer accounts
during fiscal 2005 totaled $2.1 million, and the balance in
this reserve was $11.0 million as of April 2, 2005.

A reserve for trade discounts is established based on open
invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers
and is treated as a reduction of sales.

Estimated customer end of season allowances (also referred to as
customer markdowns) are included as a reduction of sales. These
provisions are based on retail sales performance, seasonal
negotiations with our customers as well as historic deduction
trends and an evaluation of current market conditions. Our
historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above)

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
deductions by customers relating to individual shipments. This
reserve, net of expected recoveries, is included as a reduction
of sales. The reserve is based on chargebacks received as of the
date of the financial statements and past experience. Our
historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above)

Costs associated with potential returns of products are included
as a reduction of sales. These reserves are based on current
information regarding retail performance, historical experience
and an evaluation of current market conditions. Our historical
estimates of these costs have not differed materially from
actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above)

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost First-in, First-out,
(“FIFO”), method, or market. We continually evaluate
the composition of our inventories assessing slow-turning,
ongoing product as well as prior seasons’ fashion product.
Market value of distressed inventory is determined based on
historical sales trends for the category of inventory involved,
the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates
may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix
of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and
market conditions. We review our inventory position on a
quarterly basis at a minimum and adjust our estimates based on
revised projections and current market conditions. If economic
conditions worsen, we incorrectly anticipate trends or
unexpected events occur, our estimates could be proven overly
optimistic, and required adjustments could materially adversely
affect future results of operations. Our historical estimates of
these costs have not differed materially from actual results.

Goodwill, Other Intangibles, Net and Long-Lived
    Assets

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but rather be tested,
at least annually, for impairment. This pronouncement also
requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized
over their respective lives to their estimated residual values,
and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” During fiscal 2005, there
have been no material impairment losses recorded in connection
with the assessment of the carrying value of long-lived and
intangible assets.

The recoverability of the carrying values of all long-lived
assets with definite lives is reevaluated when changes in
circumstances indicate the assets’ value may be impaired.
In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we use our best
estimate of the future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and eventual disposition. If the sum of the
expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
the asset, an impairment loss, equal to the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the asset, is recognized.
In determining the future cash flows, we take various factors
into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the
impact of more experienced store managers, the impact of
increased local advertising and the emphasis on store cost
controls. Since the determination of future cash flows is an
estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments
in the event the future cash flows do not meet expectations.

During the year ended April 2, 2005, we recorded a
$1.3 million impairment charge related to the fixed assets
at three Club Monaco retail locations.



Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses for employee insurance, workers’
compensation, profit sharing, contracted advertising,
professional fees and other outstanding obligations are assessed
based on claims experience and statistical trends, open
contractual obligations, and estimates based on projections and
current requirements. If these trends change significantly, then
actual results would likely be impacted. Our historical
estimates of these costs and our provisions have not differed
materially from actual results.

Derivative Instruments

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and
interpreted, requires that each derivative instrument (including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
and measured at its fair value. The statement also requires that
changes in the derivative’s fair value be recognized
currently in earnings in either income (loss) from continuing
operations or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge
accounting treatment.

We use foreign currency forward contracts for the specific
purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in forecasted
cash flows associated primarily with inventory purchases mainly
for our European businesses, royalty payments from our Japanese
licensee, and other specific activities. These instruments are
designated as cash flow hedges and, in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, to the extent the hedges are highly
effective, the changes in fair value are included in Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), net of related tax effects,
with the corresponding asset or liability recorded in the
balance sheet. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge,
if any, is recognized in current-period earnings. Amounts
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reflected
in current-period earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings. If the relative values of the currencies involved in
the hedging activities were to move dramatically, such movement
could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We
are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
which would result in different amounts being reported that
would materially affect our financial condition or results of
operations.

Hedge accounting requires that at inception and at the beginning
of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the hedge
will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment involves
an estimation of the probability of the occurrence of
transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different
assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the
results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the
timing of when changes in derivative fair values and underlying
hedged items are recorded in earnings.

We hedge our net investment position in subsidiaries which
conduct business in Euros by borrowing directly in foreign
currency and designating a portion of our Euro denominated debt
as a hedge of net investments. Under SFAS No. 133,
changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately
recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to offset the
change in the value of the net investment being hedged.

Inflation

The rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a
significant impact on our sales or profitability.

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note 1 to Our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Alternative Accounting Methods

In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States allow for the selection of alternative
accounting methods. Our significant policies that involve the
selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock
options and inventories.

•

Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are
    available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method.
    We use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock
    options, and



accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized.
    Beginning in Fiscal 2007, we will be required to expense the
    fair value of stock options granted to employees (see discussion
    below). Under the fair value method, the determination of the
    pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option
    life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used,
    diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2004 would decrease
    approximately 10%. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

•

Two alternative methods for accounting for wholesale inventories
    are the First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) method and the
    Last-in, First-out (“LIFO”) method. We account for all
    wholesale inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative
    methods for accounting for retail inventories are the retail
    method and the cost method. We account for all retail
    inventories under the cost method.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Interpretation Number 47
(“FIN 47”), “Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations.” FIN 47 provides
clarification regarding the meaning of the term
“conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in
FASB 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” We are currently evaluating the impact of
FIN 47 on our financial statements.

In December 2003, The Securities Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104
(“SAB 104”), “Revenue Recognition”.
SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject
of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must
be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from
transactions. We do not expect the issuance of SAB 104 to
have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations
or financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. 109-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation
Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”
(“FSP No. 109-2”). FSP No. 109-2 provides
guidance under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes,” with respect to recording the potential
impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”) on
enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability.
FSP No. 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time
beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate
the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or
repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying
SFAS No. 109. We are currently evaluating the impact
of FSP No. 109-2 on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R,
“Share-Based Payment,” a revision of FASB Statement
No. 123. Under this standard, all forms of share-based
payment to employees, including stock options, would be treated
as compensation and recognized in the income statement. This
proposed statement would be effective for awards granted,
modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. We currently account for stock options under
APB No. 25. The pro forma impact of expensing options,
valued using the Black Scholes valuation model, is disclosed in
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company is currently researching the appropriate valuation model
to use for stock options. In connection with the issuance of
SFAS 123R, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin number 107 (“SAB 107”)
in March of 2005. SAB 107 provides implementation guidance
for companies to use in their adoption of SFAS 123R. We are
currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 123R and
SAB 107 on our financial statements with the intent of
implementing this standard in Fiscal 2007.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, “Exchanges
of Nonmonetary Assets.” SFAS 153 is an amendment of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 29, “Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions,” and eliminates certain
narrow differences between APB 29 and international
accounting standards. SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal
periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The adoption
of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on
our financial statements.



In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 152,
“Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing
Transactions.” SFAS 152 is an amendment of
SFAS 66 and 67 and generally requires that real estate time
sharing transactions be accounted for as non retail land sales.
SFAS 152 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 152 is not
expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, “Inventory
costs.” SFAS 151 is an amendment of Accounting
Research Board Opinion number 43 and sets standards for the
treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2004. We are
currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 151 on our
financial statements.

In October 2004, the FASB Emerging Issue Task Force issued its
abstract No. 04-01 (“EITF 04-01”)
“Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the
Parties to a Business Combination.” EITF 04-01
addresses the appropriate accounting treatment for portions of
the acquisition costs of an entity which may be deemed to apply
to Elements of a pre-existing business relationship between the
acquiring company and the target company. EITF 04-01 is
effective for combinations consummated after October 2004. It is
therefore applicable to the pending Footwear acquisition
discussed in Note 23. Historically, we had not assigned any
value to pre-existing business relationships reacquired in
purchase transactions. The adoption of EITF 04-01 has no
effect on historical financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No.
(“FIN”) 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” which was amended by FIN 46R in
December, 2003. A variable interest entity is a corporation,
partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for
business purposes that either (a) does not have equity
investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors
that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. Historically, entities
generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled
through voting interests. FIN 46R changes that by requiring
a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if
that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from
the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to
receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or
both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is
called the “primary beneficiary” of that entity.
FIN 46R also requires disclosures about variable interest
entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in
which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46R apply immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The
consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing
entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning
after December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure
requirements apply to all financial statements issued after
January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest
entity was established. The adoption of FIN 46R required us
to consolidate the assets and liabilities of RL Media. See
Notes 2 and 4 to consolidated financial statements
regarding Ralph Lauren Media consolidation and our interest in
Ralph Lauren Media, LLC.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents
the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising
from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency
exchange rates.

We manage these exposures through operating and financing
activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative
financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use of
derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk
exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency
fluctuations.

During Fiscal 2005, there were significant fluctuations in the
value of the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. In June 2002, we
entered into a cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact
of foreign exchange fluctuations on the long-term Euro debt and
the impact of fluctuations in the interest rate on the fair
value of the long-term Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the
cross currency rate swap, and entered into an interest rate
swap, to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the
Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest
rate. The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted
market prices and theoretical pricing models obtained through
independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of
financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying
terms and maturities. These



quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible
loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. We have assets and liabilities
denominated in certain foreign currencies related to
international subsidiaries. At April 2, 2005, we had the
following foreign exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to
deliver

€

94.3 million
in exchange for $124.3 million through Fiscal 2005 and
(ii) to deliver ¥11,389 million in exchange for
$99.6 million through Fiscal 2008. We believe that these
financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to
foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these
contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets,
liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We are exposed to
credit-related losses if the counterparty to the financial
instruments fails to perform its obligations. However, we do not
expect the counterparty, which presently has high credit
ratings, to fail to meet its obligations.

Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to our Euro debt.
As of April 2, 2005, the fair value of our fixed Euro debt
was $306.9 million, based on its quoted market price as
listed on the London Stock exchange and translated using Euro
exchange rates in effect as of April 2, 2005. The potential
increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting
from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates would
have been approximately $30.7 million at April 2,
2005. As of April 2, 2005, a hypothetical immediate 10%
adverse change in exchange rates would have had a
$6.5 million unfavorable impact over a one-year period on
our earnings and cash flows.

Interest Rates

Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our fixed rate
debt. The potential decrease in fair value of our fixed rate
Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in
interest rates would have been approximately $4.5 million
at April 2, 2005. We employ a fair value hedging strategy
utilizing interest rate swaps to effectively float a portion of
our interest rate exposure on our fixed rate Euro debt. On
April 6, 2004 and October 4, 2004, the company
executed interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate
on an additional total of Euro 100 million of the Eurobonds
to a floating rate. After the execution of this swap,
approximately

€

22 million
of Eurobonds remained at fixed interest rate.

Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and procedures are the controls and other
procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported with the time period specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer’s management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this
annual report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not



effective as of the fiscal year end covered by this annual
report due to the material weakness in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting described below in
management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting.

(b) Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on
the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

. We
excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial
reporting at our Childrenswear, business which was acquired
effective July 2, 2004 and whose financial statements
reflect total assets, net sales and operating income
constituting 18%, 5% and 13% of our consolidated total assets,
net revenues and operating income, respectively, as of and for
the fiscal year ended April 2, 2005. Based on this
evaluation, management concluded that as of April 2, 2005,
the Company did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as there was more than a remote likelihood
that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or
interim financial statements with respect to income taxes would
not be prevented or detected, on a timely basis, by Company
employees in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions.

This control deficiency, which management determined to be a
material weakness under the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board’s Auditing Standard No. 2, results from not
having adequate resources with expertise in matters relating to
the accounting for income taxes. Specifically, our controls
related to the preparation and review of our income tax
provision failed to prevent or detect errors in calculating the
income tax provision and deferred income tax and income tax
payable balances for the year ended April 2, 2005, which
were identified by Deloitte & Touche, LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm. We determined
that our personnel responsible for performing and reviewing the
income tax provision calculation and related disclosures lack
the necessary expertise and resources to evaluate in a timely
manner the tax implications of certain non-routine transactions
and new state and federal tax legislation and to complete a
comprehensive and timely review of the income tax accounts.
Prior to the completion of the audit, material adjustments were
necessary to the income tax provision, current taxes payable,
certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and required tax
footnote disclosures to present the annual financial statements
for the year ended April 2, 2005 in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of the material weakness described above, our management
believes that, as of April 2, 2005, we did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting based on the
COSO criteria.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2005 was
audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,
which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and
incorporated herein by reference to the 2005 Annual Report to
Shareholders.

(c) Changes in internal controls over financial
reporting

The Company made no changes in its internal control over
financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
covered by this report in connection with its assessment that
would materially affect its internal control over financial
reporting. Subsequent to April 2, 2005, the Company hired a
new Vice President of Tax and will be hiring additional full
time tax accounting staff with strong tax technical and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 109
skills. The Company intends to implement an ongoing training
program to enhance the abilities of internal tax personnel. A
detailed policy to ensure the accuracy of tax calculations and
that all income tax accounts are properly reconciled will be
implemented.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation is responsible
for the preparation, objectivity and integrity of the
consolidated financial statements and other information
contained in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and include
some amounts that are based on management’s informed
judgements and best estimates.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, has audited these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and have
expressed herein their unqualified opinion on those financial
statements.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which oversees
all of the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf
of the Board of Directors, consists solely of independent
directors, meets with the independent registered accountants,
internal auditors and management periodically to review their
respective activities and the discharge of their respective
responsibilities. Both the independent registered accountants
and the internal auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit
Committee, with or without management, to discuss the scope and
results of their audits and any recommendations regarding the
system of internal controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of April 2, 2005 and April 3,
2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended April 2, 2005. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Polo
Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 2,
2005 and April 3, 2004, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended April 2, 2005, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements as of April 3, 2004 and for the fiscal
years ended April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003 have been
restated.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of April 2, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
June 30, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting because of a material
weakness.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

New York, New York

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
April 2, 2005, because of the effect of the material
weakness identified in management’s assessment based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination
of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness has been identified and included in
management’s assessment: As of April 2, 2005, certain
controls designed to prevent and detect errors related to income
tax accounting and disclosures did not operate effectively.
Specifically, the Company did not have enough resources with
adequate expertise to identify and evaluate in a timely manner
the tax implications of certain non-routine transactions and new
state and federal tax legislation and to complete a
comprehensive and timely review of the income tax accruals. This
led to material misstatements in the income tax provision,
current taxes payable, certain deferred tax assets and
liabilities and required tax footnote disclosures.

F-4


This material weakness was considered in determining the nature,
timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements and the related financial
statement schedule as of and for the year ended April 2,
2005, of the Company and this report does not affect our report
on such financial statements and financial statement schedule.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of April 2, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the
material weakness described above on the achievement of the
objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of April 2, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for
each of the three years in the period ended April 2, 2005,
and the related financial statement schedule included in the
index at Item 15, and our report dated June 30, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
and the related financial statement schedule.

Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (“PRLC”) and its wholly
and majority owned subsidiaries as well as variable interest
entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
PRLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as
“the Company,” “we,” “us,”
“our” and “ourselves,” unless the content
requires otherwise.

Business

We design, license, contract for the manufacture of, market and
distribute men’s and women’s apparel, accessories,
fragrances, skin care products and home furnishings. Our sales
are principally to major department and specialty stores located
throughout the United States and Europe. We also sell directly
to consumers through full-price and outlet Polo Ralph Lauren,
Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores located throughout the
United States, Canada, Europe, South America and Asia and
through our retail internet site located at www.polo.com.

We are party to licensing agreements which grant the licensee
exclusive rights to use our various trademarks in connection
with the manufacture and sale of designated products in
specified geographic areas. The license agreements typically
provide for designated terms with renewal options based on
achievement of specified sales targets. The agreements also
require that certain minimum amounts be spent on advertising for
licensed products. Additionally, as part of the licensing
arrangements, each licensee is typically required to enter into
a design services agreement pursuant to which design and other
creative services are provided. The license and design services
agreements provide for payments based on specified percentages
of net sales of licensed products. Additionally, we have granted
royalty-free licenses to independent parties to operate Polo
stores to promote the sale of our merchandise and our
licensees’ merchandise both domestically and
internationally.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31.
All references to “Fiscal 2005” represent 52-week
fiscal year ended April 2, 2005. All references to
“Fiscal 2004” represent the 53-week fiscal year ended
April 3, 2004 and references to “Fiscal 2003”
represent the 52-week fiscal year ended March 29, 2003.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates by their
nature are based on judgements and available information. The
estimates that we make are based upon historical factors,
current circumstances and the experience and judgement of our
management. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an
ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our
evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate
future information, may affect amounts reported in future
periods. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or
circumstances which would result in different amounts being
reported that would materially affect our financial condition or
results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue within the Company’s wholesale operations is
recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is
transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of
returns, discounts, allowances and operational chargebacks.
Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management.
Discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end-of-season
allowances are based on historic trends, seasonal results, an
evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer
performance. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on
a quarterly basis based on current experience, trends and
retailer performance. The Company’s historical estimates of
these costs have not differed materially from actual results.
Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at
the time of sale to consumers. Licensing revenue is initially
recorded based upon contractually guaranteed minimum levels and
adjusted as actual sales data is received from licensees. During
the fiscal years ending April 2, 2005 and April 3,
2004, the Company reduced revenues and credited customer
accounts for end of season customer allowances, operational
chargebacks and returns as follows:

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” In accordance with
SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
as measured by statutory tax rates that are expected to be in
effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and
liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant
judgement is required in determining the worldwide provisions
for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business,
there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome
is uncertain. It is the Company’s policy to establish
provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as
a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company
establishes the provisions based upon management’s
assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences
and tax credits. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically
and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant
adjustments to those provisions.

Accounts Receivable, Net

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to
its wholesale customers that satisfy pre-defined credit
criteria. Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, is net of the following allowances and reserves.

An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through
analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, assessments of collectibility
based on an evaluation of historic and anticipated trends, the
financial condition of the Company’s customers, and an
evaluation of the impact of economic conditions. Expenses of
$6.0 million were recorded as an allowance for
uncollectible accounts during Fiscal 2005. The amounts written
off against customer accounts during Fiscal 2005 totaled
$2.1 million, and the balance in this reserve was
$11.0 million as of April 2, 2005.

POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A reserve for trade discounts is established based on open
invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers
and is treated as a reduction of sales.

Estimated customer end of season allowances (also referred to as
customer markdowns) are included as a reduction of sales. These
provisions are based on retail sales performance, seasonal
negotiations with the Company’s customers as well as
historic deduction trends and an evaluation of current market
conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs have not
differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue
Recognition above)

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
deductions by customers relating to individual shipments. This
reserve, net of expected recoveries, is included as a reduction
of sales. The reserve is based on chargebacks received as of the
date of the financial statements and past experience. Our
historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above)

Costs associated with potential returns of products are included
as a reduction of sales. These reserves are based on current
information regarding retail performance, historical experience
and an evaluation of current market conditions. The
Company’s historical estimates of these costs have not
differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue
Recognition above)

Inventories

Inventories, net are stated at lower of cost (using the
first-in-first-out method, “FIFO”) or market. The
Company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories
assessing slow-turning, ongoing product as well as all fashion
product. Market value of distressed inventory is determined
based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory
of the Company’s individual product lines, the impact of
market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current
orders in-house relating to the future sales of this type of
inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to
quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and
retailer preferences and market conditions. The Company’s
historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not
differed materially from actual results.

Goodwill, Other Intangibles, Net and Long-Lived
    Assets

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but rather be tested,
at least annually, for impairment. This pronouncement also
requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized
over their respective lives to their estimated residual values,
and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” During fiscal 2005, there
have been no material impairment losses recorded in connection
with the assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets.

The recoverability of the carrying values of all long-lived
assets with definite lives is reevaluated when changes in
circumstances indicate the assets’ value may be impaired.
In evaluating an asset for recoverability, the Company estimates
the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and eventual disposition. If sum of the expected future
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss, equal to the excess of the carrying amount over
the fair value of the asset, is recognized. In determining the
future cash flows the Company takes various factors into
account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the impact
of more experienced store managers, the impact of increased
local advertising and the emphasis on store cost controls. Since
the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future
performance, there may be future impairments in the event the
future cash flow does not meet expectations.

During the year ended April 2, 2005, the Company recorded a
$1.3 million impairment charge related to the fixed assets
at three retail locations.

POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inflation

The rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a
significant impact on our sales or profitability.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less, including
investments in debt securities. Our investments in debt
securities are diversified among high-credit quality securities
in accordance with our risk management policy and primarily
include commercial paper and money market funds.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Buildings and building
improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over
37.5 years. Machinery and equipment, and furniture and
fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives of three to ten years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining
lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Officers’ Life Insurance

We maintain whole life insurance policies on several of our
senior executives. These policies are recorded at their cash
surrender value. Additionally we have policies with split dollar
arrangements which are recorded at the lesser of their cash
surrender value or premiums paid. Amounts recorded under both
types of policies aggregated $51.2 million and
$50.2 million at April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004,
respectively, and are included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

During Fiscal 2003, the Company ceased paying premiums on split
dollar life insurance policies related to officers and
terminated certain split dollar arrangements. As of
April 2, 2005, $2.1 million of split dollar policies
had either been surrendered to the insurance company for cash or
bought out by the related employee.

Deferred Rent Obligations

We account for rent expense under noncancelable operating leases
with scheduled rent increases and landlord incentives on a
straight-line basis over the lease term beginning with the
effective lease commencement date. The excess of straight-line
rent expense over scheduled payment amounts and landlord
incentives is recorded as a deferred liability. Unamortized
deferred rent obligations amounted to $74.1 million and
$66.0 million at April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004,
respectively, and are included Other noncurrent liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Other Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income is recorded net of taxes and is
reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders’
equity. Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains
or losses on hedges and foreign currency translation adjustments.

Financial Instruments

From time to time, we use derivative financial instruments to
reduce our exposure to changes in foreign exchange and interest
rates. While these instruments are subject to risk of loss from
changes in exchange or interest rates, those losses generally
would be offset by gains on the related exposure. The accounting
for changes in the fair value of a derivative is dependent upon
the intended use of the derivative. SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as Amended and Interpreted,” requires that

F-13


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

every derivative instrument (including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the
derivative’s fair value be recognized currently in earnings
in either income (loss) from continuing operations or
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on the
timing and designated purpose of the derivative.

Note 13 further describes the derivative instruments we are
party to and the related accounting treatment. Historically, we
have entered into interest rate swap agreements and forward
foreign exchange contracts, which qualify as cash flow hedges
under SFAS No. 133. We have also designated the entire
balance of our Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a
foreign subsidiary. During Fiscal 2005, we have entered into
various forward exchange contracts that qualified as hedges on
inventory purchases and royalty payments.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations

The financial position and results of operations of our foreign
subsidiaries are measured using the Euro in our European
operations and Yen in our Japanese operations as the functional
currencies. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
exchange rate in effect at each year end. Results of operations
are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing
throughout the period. Translation adjustments arising from
differences in exchange rates from period to period are included
in other comprehensive income, net of taxes, except for certain
foreign-denominated debt. Gains and losses on translation of
intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries of a long-term
investment nature are also included in this component of
stockholders’ equity. We have designated our Euro debt as a
hedge of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. Prior to
fully designating our Euro debt as a hedge, transaction gains or
losses resulting from changes in the Eurodollar rate were
recorded in income and amounted to $3.2 million in Fiscal
2003. The gain on the Japanese Yen forward contracts, that did
not qualify for hedge accounting, amounted to $2.4 million
in Fiscal 2003. Gains and losses from other foreign currency
transactions are separately identified in the consolidated
statements of income.

Cost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and
produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in,
import costs, as well as reserves for shrinkage and inventory
obsolescence. The costs of selling the merchandise, including
preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing,
warehousing and order charges, are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses (“SG&A”).

Shipping and Handling Costs

We reflect shipping and handling costs incurred as a component
of SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
The shipping and handling costs incurred approximated
$69.6 million, $61.0 million and $59.9 million in
Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. As a
percent of revenues, they represented 2.1%, 2.6% and 2.7% in
Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. We bill
our wholesale customers for shipping and handling costs and
record such revenues in net sales upon shipment.

Advertising

We expense the production costs of advertising, marketing and
public relations expenses upon the first showing of the related
advertisement. We expense the costs of advertising paid to
customers under cooperative advertising programs when the
related advertisements are run. Total advertising expenses,
including cooperative advertising, included within SG&A
expenses amounted to $126.6 million, $112.3 million
and $92.8 million in Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal
2003, respectively.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share was calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the
period, excluding any potential dilution. Diluted net income per
share was calculated similarly but includes potential dilution
from the exercise of stock options and awards. The difference
between the basic and diluted weighted-average shares
outstanding is due to the dilutive effect of stock options,
restricted stock units and restricted stock awards issued under
our stock option plans.

Stock Options

We use the intrinsic value method to account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and have adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended
by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.”
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for fixed
stock option grants. Had compensation costs for the
Company’s stock option grants been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates for awards under these plans in
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
proforma amounts as follows (Dollars in thousands, except per
share data):

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted
during Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 was $11.90,
$10.83 and $11.06, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date
fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units
granted during Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 was
$37.00, $25.33 and $18.21, respectively.

For this purpose, the fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and
Fiscal 2003, respectively: expected volatility of 35.0%, 40.4%
and 47.2%; risk-free interest rates of 3.29%, 2.56% and 3.69%;
expected lives of 5.2 years; and a dividend of $0.20, $0.20
and $0.00.

Reclassifications

For comparative purposes, certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current period’s
presentation.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements

As a result of the clarifications contained in the
February 7, 2005 letter from the Office of the Chief
Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) to the Center for Public Company Audit Firms
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
regarding specific lease accounting issues, we initiated a
review of the Company’s lease accounting practices.
Management and the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board
of Directors determined that our accounting practices were
incorrect with respect to rent holiday periods and the
classification of landlord incentives and the related
amortization. We have made all appropriate adjustments to
correct these errors for all periods presented.

In periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we
recorded straight-line rent expense for store operating leases
over the related store’s lease term beginning with the
commencement date of store operations. Rent expense was not
recognized during any build-out period. To correct this
practice, we adopted a policy in which rent expense is
recognized on a straight-line over the stores’ lease term
commencing with the build-out period (the effective
lease-commencement date). This correction resulted in a
reduction in operating income of $2.9 million and an
increase of $2.4 million for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003,
respectively.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we incorrectly
classified tenant allowances (amount received from a landlord to
fund leasehold improvements) as a reduction of property and
equipment rather than as a deferred lease incentive liability.
The amortization of these landlord incentives was originally
recorded as a reduction in depreciation expense rather than as a
reduction of rent expense. In addition, our statements of cash
flows had originally reflected these incentives as a reduction
of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing
activities rather than as cash flows from operating activities.
These corrections resulted in an increase to net property and
equipment and deferred lease incentive liabilities of
$11.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively, at
April 3, 2004. Additionally, for each of the fiscal years
in the two-year period ended April 3, 2004, the
reclassification of the amortization of deferred lease
incentives resulted in a decrease to rent expense with a
corresponding increase to depreciation expense of
$2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. A
$5.5 million decrease was recorded to retained earnings as
of March 30, 2002 as a result of this restatement.

In January 2000, Ralph Lauren Media, LLC, a joint venture with
National Broadcasting Company, Inc. and certain affiliated
companies (“NBC”), was formed. Under this 30-year
joint venture agreement, Ralph Lauren Media is owned 50% by the
Company and 50% by NBC and related affiliates. The Company has
used the equity method of accounting for this investment since
inception.

On December 24, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standard
Board (“FASB”) issued FIN 46R, which was
applicable for financial statements issued for reporting periods
ending after March 15, 2004. The Company considered the
provisions of FIN 46R in its fiscal 2004 financial
statements and made the determination that Ralph Lauren Media
was a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under
FIN 46R. At that time the Company also determined that it
was not the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R and,
therefore, was not required to consolidate the results of Ralph
Lauren Media.

Upon subsequent review the Company has concluded that its
determination in 2004 was incorrect and that consolidation of
Ralph Lauren Media into the Company’s financial statements
was required as of April 3, 2004. The impact on the
Company’s balance sheet as of April 3, 2004 is to
increase assets and liabilities. Previously, the Company
accounted for this joint venture using the equity method of
accounting under which we recognized our share of Ralph Lauren
Media’s operating results based on our share of ownership
and the terms of the joint venture agreement. As a result, there
is no impact from the consolidation on prior year’s
reported earnings.

The Company also corrected the classification of the net loss
recorded on the disposal of property and equipment from the
investing activities to the operating activities section within
the Statement of Cash Flows for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003.

Further, upon review of the Fiscal 2004 Statement of Cash Flows,
the Company concluded that certain foreign exchange results
previously classified as “Effect of exchange rate changes
on cash and cash equivalents and net investment in foreign
subsidiaries” should be classified as operating activities
and has made these corrections as part of the restatement.

A summary of the impact of the restatement to properly account
for leases and to consolidate RL Media as described in
Note 4, as of April 3, 2004 on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet as April 3, 2004, and the

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Interpretation Number 47
(“FIN 47”), “Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations.” FIN 47 provides
clarification regarding the meaning of the term
“conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in
FASB 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of FIN 47 on its financial statements.

In December 2003, The Securities Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104
(“SAB 104”), “Revenue Recognition”.
SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject
of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must
be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from
transactions. The Company does not expect the issuance of
SAB 104 to have a material effect on the consolidated
results of operations or financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. 109-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation
Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”
(“FSP No. 109-2”). FSP No. 109-2 provides
guidance under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes,” with respect to recording the potential
impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”) on
enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability.
FSP No. 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed
time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to
evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment
or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying
SFAS No. 109. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of FSP No. 109-2 on its consolidated financial
statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R,
“Share-Based Payment,” a revision of FASB Statement
No. 123. Under this standard, all forms of share-based
payment to employees, including stock options, would be treated
as compensation and recognized in the income statement. This
proposed statement would be effective for awards granted,
modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company currently accounts for stock
options under APB No. 25. The pro forma impact of expensing
options, valued using the Black Scholes valuation model, is
disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. The Company is currently researching the appropriate
valuation model to use for stock options. In connection with the
issuance of SFAS 123R, the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin number 107
(“SAB 107”) in March of 2005. SAB 107
provides implementation guidance for companies to use in their
adoption of SFAS 123R. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 on its financial
statements with intent of implementing this standard in Fiscal
2007.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, “Exchanges
of Nonmonetary Assets.” SFAS 153 is an amendment of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 29, “Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions,” and eliminates certain
narrow differences between APB 29 and international
accounting standards. SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal
periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The adoption
of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company’s financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 152,
“Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing
Transactions.” SFAS 152 is an amendment of
SFAS 66 and 67 and generally requires that real estate time
sharing transactions be accounted for as non retail land sales.
SFAS 152 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 152 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, “Inventory
costs.” SFAS 151 is an amendment of Accounting
Research Board Opinion number 43 and sets standards for the
treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2004. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 151 on its
financial statements.

In October 2004, the FASB Emerging Issue Task Force issued its
abstract No. 04-01 (“EITF 04-01”)
“Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the
Parties to a Business Combination.” EITF 04-01
addresses the appropriate accounting treatment for portions of
the acquisition costs of an entity which may be deemed to apply
to Elements of a pre-existing business relationship between the
acquiring company and the target company. EITF 04-01 is
effective for combinations consummated after October 2004. It is
therefore applicable to the pending Footwear acquisition
discussed in Note 23. Historically, the Company had not
assigned any value to pre-existing business relationships
reacquired in purchase transactions. The adoption of
EITF 04-01 has no effect on historical financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No.
(“FIN”) 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” which was amended by FIN 46R in December,
2003. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership,
trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes
that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting
rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide
sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its
activities. Historically, entities generally were not
consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting
interests. FIN 46R changes that by requiring a variable
interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company
is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable
interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s residual returns or both. A
company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called
the “primary beneficiary” of that entity. FIN 46R
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that
a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a
significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of
FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing entities in the
first fiscal year or interim period beginning after
December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure

F-19

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

requirements apply to all financial statements issued after
January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest
entity was established. The adoption of FIN 46R required us
to consolidate the assets and liabilities of RL Media. See
Note 4 regarding our interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC.

Acquisitions and Joint Venture

On July 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of certain
assets of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC for a purchase price of
approximately $263.5 million, including transaction costs.
The purchase price includes deferred payments of
$15 million over the next three years, and we have agreed
to assume certain liabilities. Additionally, we have agreed to
pay up to an additional $5 million in contingent payments
if certain sales targets are attained. During the third quarter,
we recorded a $5 million liability representing the
contingent purchase payment because we believe it is probable
the sales targets will be achieved. This amount was recorded as
an increase in goodwill. RL Childrenswear Company LLC was a Polo
Ralph Lauren licensee holding the exclusive licenses to design,
manufacture, merchandise and sell newborn, infant, toddler and
girls and boys clothing in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
In connection with this acquisition, we recorded fair values of
assets and liabilities as follows: inventory of
$26.6 million, property & equipment of
$7.5 million, intangible assets consisting of non-compete
agreements, valued at $2.5 million and customer
relationships, valued at $29.9 million, other assets of
$1.0 million, goodwill of $208.3 million and
liabilities of $12.3 million. The Company has now finalized
the allocation of the purchase price.

Operating activities of the Childrenswear Company since the
acquisition are included in the results of operations commencing
July 2, 2004, for year ended April 2, 2005.

The following unaudited pro forma information assumes the
Childrenswear acquisition had occurred on March 30, 2003.
The pro forma information, as presented below, is not indicative
of the results that would have been obtained had the transaction
occurred March 30, 2003, nor is it indicative of our future
results.

The following pro forma amounts reflect adjustments for
purchases made by us from Childrenswear, licensing royalties
paid to us by Childrenswear, amortization of the non-compete
agreements, lost interest income on the cash used for the
purchase and the income tax effect based upon an unaudited pro
forma effective tax rate of 35.5% in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal
2004. The unaudited pro forma information gives effect only to
adjustments described above and does not reflect
management’s estimate of any anticipated cost savings or
other benefits as a result of the acquisition. The unaudited pro
forma amounts include material nonrecurring charges of
approximately $7.4 million included within Cost of goods
sold related to the write up to fair value of inventory as part
of the preliminary purchase price allocation.

In November 2003, we acquired a license for the use of
trademarks for $7.5 million. This license was accounted for
as a finite lived intangible asset and is being amortized over
10 years.

In February 2003, we acquired a 50% controlling interest in the
Japanese master licensee for our men’s, women’s, kids,
home and jeans business in Japan for approximately
$24.1 million. In connection with this acquisition, we
recorded tangible assets of $11.0 million, an intangible
license valued at $9.9 million and liabilities assumed of
$8.5 million based on estimated fair values as determined
by management utilizing information available at the time. At
March 29, 2003, goodwill of $13.0 million was
recognized for the excess

POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of the purchase price plus transaction costs of
$1.3 million over the preliminary estimate of fair market
value of the net assets acquired. During Fiscal 2004, we
incurred an additional $3.5 million of transaction costs,
which have been included in goodwill, and finalized our
accounting for the acquisition, which resulted in our recording
an additional $0.5 million of goodwill.

All of the revenues and expenses for the Japanese master
licensee are included in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations because management has concluded that
certain rights granted to us in the stockholders agreement give
us perpetual legal control over our Japanese master licensee.
For the years ended April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004,
we have recorded minority interest expense of $3.8 million
and $1.4 million, respectively, to reflect the share of
earnings allocable to the 50% minority interest holder in the
Japanese master license. This amount is included in Other
(income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Also, in February 2003, we acquired an 18% equity interest in
the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph
Lauren men’s, women’s and jeans business in Japan for
approximately $47.6 million. In May 2003, we paid
$5.4 million to acquire an additional 2% equity interest in
this company. For Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, we recorded
$6.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of equity
investment income related to this investment. This amount is
included in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Results for our Japanese interests are reported on a one-month
lag.

During Fiscal 2003, we acquired several retail locations from
certain of our licensees in Belgium, Germany, and Argentina for
a total purchase price of $4.6 million.

At April 2, 2005, the Company’s accounting for the
Fiscal 2003 acquisitions has been finalized. Unaudited proforma
information related to these acquisitions is not included since
the impact of these transactions are not material to the
consolidated results of the Company.

On February 7, 2000, we announced the formation of Ralph
Lauren Media, LLC (“RL Media”), a joint venture
between National Broadcasting Company, Inc. and certain
affiliated companies (“NBC”) and ourselves. RL Media
was created to bring our American lifestyle experience to
consumers via multiple media platforms, including the Internet,
broadcast, cable and print. Under the 30-year joint venture
agreement, RL Media is owned 50% by us and 50% by NBC. In
exchange for a 50% interest, we provide marketing through our
annual print advertising campaign, make our merchandise
available at initial cost of inventory and sell RL Media’s
excess inventory through our outlet stores, among other things.
NBC contributed $40.0 million in online distribution and
promotion and a cash funding commitment up to
$50.0 million. NBC also initially committed to contribute
$110.0 million of television and online advertising. During
Fiscal 2003, RL Media entered into an agreement to sell its
unused television and advertising spots for $15.0 million.
Under the terms of the joint venture agreement we will not
absorb any losses from the joint venture which were not funded
with cash capital contributions and will share proportionately
in the net income or losses thereafter. Additionally, we will
receive a royalty on the sale of our products by RL Media based
on specified percentages of net sales over a predetermined
threshold, subject to certain limitations; to date, no such
royalty income has been recognized. RL Media’s managing
board has equal representation from NBC and us.

Through April 2, 2004, the Company used the equity method
of accounting for this investment. Under FIN 46R, we now
consolidate RL Media into our consolidated financial
statements on a one quarter lag. For the year ended
April 2, 2005 we recorded $4.2 million of minority
interest expense associated with the non-controlling equity
interest. This amount is included in the Consolidated Statement
of Income in the Other (expense) income caption.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective March 31, 2002, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 142. This accounting standard requires that
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer
amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Other
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives. The transitional impairment
tests were completed and did not result in an impairment charge.
We completed our annual impairment test as of the first day of
the second quarter of Fiscal 2005. As a result of this test, no
impairment was recognized.

2003 Restructuring Plan

During the third quarter of Fiscal 2003, we completed a
strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our
plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its
business operations. The major initiatives of the plan included
the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five
cities in three countries to one location; the consolidation of
our European logistics operations to Italy; and the migration of
all European information systems to a standard global system. In
connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company has
recorded a restructuring charge of $2.1 million during
Fiscal 2005 and $7.9 million during Fiscal 2004 for
severance and contract termination costs. The $2.1 million
represents the additional liability for employees notified of
their termination and properties we ceased using during Fiscal
2005. The major components of the charge and the activity
through April 2, 2005 were as follows:

Total severance and termination benefits as a result of this
restructuring related to approximately 160 employees. Total
cash outlays related to this plan of approximately
$23.3 million have been paid through April 2, 2005. It
is expected that this plan will be completed, and the remaining
liabilities will be paid, in accordance with contract terms.

2001 Operational Plan

During the second quarter of Fiscal 2001, we completed an
internal operational review and formalized our plans to enhance
the growth of our worldwide luxury retail business, to better
manage inventory and to increase our overall profitability. The
major initiatives of the 2001 Operational Plan included:
refining our retail strategy; developing efficiencies in our
supply chain; and consolidating corporate strategic business
functions and internal processes. Costs associated with this
aspect of the 2001 Operational Plan included lease and contract
termination costs, store fixed asset writedowns and severance
and termination benefits.

In connection with the implementation of the 2001 Operational
Plan, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of
$128.6 million in our second quarter of Fiscal 2001. This
charge was subsequently adjusted for a $5.0 million
reduction of liabilities in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2001
and a $16.0 million increase in the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2002 for lease termination costs associated with the
closure of our retail stores. During Fiscal 2004, a
$10.4 million increase was recorded due to market factors
that were less favorable than

originally estimated. The major components of the charge and the
activity through April 2, 2005, were as follows:

Total severance and termination benefits as a result of the 2001
Operational Plan related to approximately 550 employees, all of
whom have been terminated. Total cash outlays related to the
2001 Operational Plan are expected to be approximately
$51.2 million, $47.0 million of which have been paid
through April 2, 2005. We completed the implementation of
the 2001 Operational Plan in Fiscal 2002 and expect to settle
the remaining liabilities in accordance with contract terms.

2004, and $1.2 million in Fiscal 2003 arising from the tax
benefits related to the exercise of nonqualified stock options.
These amounts have been credited to capital in excess of par
value.

The deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences, primarily net operating loss carryforwards,
property and equipment and accounts receivable, between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The
components of the net deferred tax assets at April 2, 2005
and April 3, 2004 were as follows:

We have available federal, state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $3.6 million,
$81 million and $6 million, respectively, for tax
purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss
carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal 2006. The utilization
of the federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to
the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which
applies following certain changes in ownership of the entity
generating the loss carryforward.

Also, we have available state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $135 million and
$50 million, respectively, for which no net deferred tax
asset has been recognized. A full valuation

allowance has been recorded since we do not believe that we will
more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to
offset future taxable income. Subsequent recognition of a
portion of the deferred tax asset relating to these federal,
state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards would result
in a reduction of goodwill recorded in connection with
acquisitions. Additionally, we have recorded a valuation
allowance against certain other deferred tax assets relating to
our foreign operations. Subsequent recognition of these deferred
tax assets, as well as a portion of the foreign net operating
loss carryforwards, would result in an income tax benefit in the
year of such recognition. During the year, the Company resolved
audits in various foreign jurisdictions resulting in a
$19 million reduction of the NOL’s which were subject
to a full valuation allowance. The Company also increased the
valuation allowance by $8 million relating to current year
losses incurred in these foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore,
changes in other deferred tax components resulted in a
$3 million increase in the valuation allowance. These
valuation allowances have been recorded because management has
determined that it is more likely than not that such tax
benefits will not be realized.

Provision has not been made for United States or additional
foreign taxes on approximately $188 million of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings
have been and will continue to be reinvested. These earnings
could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends,
if foreign earnings were lent to PRLC, a subsidiary or a United
States affiliate of PRLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries
were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practical. We
believe that the amount of the additional taxes that might be
payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if remitted,
would be partially offset by United States foreign tax credits.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs
Act”) was signed into law on October 22, 2004. The
Jobs Act included a special one-time 85% dividends received
deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earning to a
U.S. taxpayer (the “Repatriation Provision”),
provided that specified conditions and restrictions are
satisfied, including a requirement that the repatriated foreign
earnings are invested in the U.S. pursuant to a domestic
reinvestment plan. On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued
FSB 109-2 which permits companies additional time beyond
the financial reporting period in which the Jobs Act was enacted
to evaluate the effect of the Repatriation Provision. As of
April 2, 2005, the Company has not yet completed its
evaluation of the impact of the Repatriation Provision and
cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time. Accordingly,
the impact of the Repatriation Provision has not been reflected
in the Company’s financial statements. The Company expects
to complete its evaluation of the Repatriation Provision and the
related tax impact during the next fiscal year.

The Company is periodically examined by various federal, state
and foreign tax jurisdictions. The tax years under examination
vary by jurisdiction. We regularly consider the likelihood of
assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions and have
established tax allowances which represent management’s
best estimate of the potential assessments. The resolution of
tax matters could differ from the amount reserved. While that
difference could be material to the results of operations and
cash flows for any affected reporting period, it is not expected
to have a material impact on consolidated financial position or
consolidated liquidity.

The historical provision for income taxes in Fiscal 2005, Fiscal
2004 and Fiscal 2003 differs from the amounts computed by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes due to the following:

Financing Agreements

Prior to October 6, 2004, we had a credit facility with a
syndicate of banks consisting of a $300.0 million revolving
line of credit, subject to increase to $375.0 million,
which was available for direct borrowings and the issuance of
letters of credit. It was scheduled to mature on
November 18, 2005.

On October 6, 2004, we, in substance, expanded and extended
this bank credit facility by entering into a new credit
agreement, dated as of that date, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as
Administrative Agent, The Bank of New York, Fleet National Bank,
SunTrust Bank and Wachovia Bank National Association, as
Syndication Agents, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as sole
Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger, and a syndicate of lending
banks that included each of the lending banks under the prior
credit agreement (the “New Credit Facility”).

The New Credit Facility, which is otherwise substantially on the
same terms as the prior credit facility, provides for a
$450.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to
increase to $525.0 million, which is available for direct
borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It will mature
on October 6, 2009. We incur a financing charge of ten
basis points per month on the average monthly balance of these
outstanding letters of credit. Direct borrowings under the New
Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to
(i) the higher of (x) the weighted average overnight
Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, plus one-half of one percent, and (y) the prime
commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect from
time to time, or (ii) the LIBO Rate (as defined in the New
Credit Facility) in effect from time to time, as adjusted for
the Federal Reserve Board’s Eurocurrency Liabilities
maximum reserve percentage, and a margin based on our then
current credit ratings. As of April 2, 2005, the margin was
0.625%.

The New Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain
covenants:

•

a minimum ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
    Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (“EBITDAR”) to
    Consolidated Interest Expense (as such terms are described in
    the New Credit Facility); and

•

a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt (as defined in the New Credit
    Facility) to EBITDAR.

The New Credit Facility also contains covenants that, subject to
specified exceptions, restrict our ability to:

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit
Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the New
Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
immediately due and payable. The New Credit Facility specifies a
number of events of default (many of which are subject to
applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
covenants, including the financial covenants described above.
Additionally, the New Credit Facility provides that an event of
default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities
fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting
power of our common stock.

On November 22, 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of
6.125% Notes (“Euro debt”) due November 2006. The
Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net
proceeds from the Euro debt offering were $281.5 million
based on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. A portion
of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to finance the
acquisition of stock and certain assets of Poloco while the
remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate
purposes. Interest on the Euro debt is payable annually. Through
Fiscal 2004, we repurchased Euro 47.7 million of our
outstanding Euro debt, or $43.6 million based on Euro
exchange rates. The loss on this early extinguishment of debt
was not material.

At April 2, 2005, we had no balance outstanding under the
New Credit Facility and $291.0 million outstanding in Euro
debt based on the year end Euro exchange rate. We were also
contingently liable for $29.8 million in outstanding
letters of credit related primarily to commitments for the
purchase of inventory. At April 3, 2004, we had no balance
outstanding under the New Credit Facility and
$277.3 million outstanding in Euro debt based on the year
end Euro exchange rate. The credit facilities bore interest
primarily at the institution’s prime rate. The
weighted-average interest rate on borrowings was 3.4%, 3.8% and
5.4% in Fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The carrying amounts of financial instruments reported in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximated their
estimated fair values, except for the Euro debt, primarily due
to either the short-term maturity of the instruments or their
adjustable market rate of interest. The fair value of the Euro
debt, net of discounts, was $306.9 million, and
$292.6 million, as of April 2, 2005 and April 3,
2004 respectively, based on its quoted market price as listed on
the London Stock Exchange.

13.

Financial Instruments

We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow
hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce our
risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases and
intercompany royalty payments. Gains and losses on these
contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either
the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains/losses, as
applicable. At April 2, 2005, we had the following foreign
exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to
deliver

€

94.3 million
in exchange for $124.3 million through Fiscal 2005 and
(ii) to deliver ¥11,389 million in exchange for
$99.6 million through Fiscal 2008. At April 2, 2005,
the fair value of these contracts resulted in unrealized gains
and losses, net of taxes of $1.8 million and
$8.2 million, for the Euro forward contracts and Japanese
Yen forward contracts, respectively.

In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap
(discussed below), and entered into an interest rate swap that
terminates in November 2006. The interest rate swap is being
used to convert Euro 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate
borrowings into Euro 105.2 million, EURIBOR minus
1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the interest
rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of
the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest
rate. The swap has been designated as a fair value hedge under
SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured as the
difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in
earnings from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate
swap and the Euro debt resulting from changes in the benchmark
interest rate, and was de minimis for Fiscal 2005. In addition,
we have designated the entire principal of the Euro debt as a
hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. As
a result, changes in the fair value of the Euro debt resulting
from changes in the Euro rate are reported net of income taxes
in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated
financial statements as an unrealized gain or loss on foreign
currency hedges. On April 6, 2004 and October 4, 2004,
the Company executed interest rate swaps to convert the fixed
interest rate on an additional total of

€

100.0 million
of the Eurobonds to a floating rate (EURIBOR based). After the
execution of this swap, approximately

€

22.0 million
of the Eurobonds remained at a fixed interest rate.

For the year ended April 2, 2005, Accumulated other
comprehensive income included Unrealized losses of
$48.7 million related to Euro 227.3 million of foreign
investment hedged. For the year ended April 3, 2004,

F-29


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Other Comprehensive income included Unrealized losses of
$37.7 million related to Euro 205.8 million of
foreign investment hedged.

In November 2002, the Company entered into forward contracts on
6.2 billion Japanese Yen that terminated in February 2003.
These forward contracts were entered into to minimize the impact
of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Japanese Yen purchase
price in connection with the transactions described in
Note 4. The forward contracts did not qualify for hedge
accounting under SFAS No. 133 and as such the changes
in the fair value of the contracts were recognized currently in
earnings. In connection with accounting for these contracts
during Fiscal 2003, the Company recognized $2.4 million of
foreign exchange gain on these forward contracts, included as a
component of foreign currency losses (gains), in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.

In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap, which
was scheduled to terminate in November 2006. The cross currency
rate swap was being used to convert
Euro 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into
$100.0 million, LIBOR plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings.
We entered into the cross currency rate swap to minimize the
impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in both principal and
interest payments resulting from Euro debt, and to minimize the
impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to
changes in LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap had been
designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133.
Hedge ineffectiveness was measured as the difference between the
respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the
changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and
the Euro debt.

In April 1999, we entered into interest rate swap agreements
with commercial banks which expired in 2003 to hedge against
interest rate fluctuations. The swap agreements effectively
converted borrowings under the 2002 bank credit facility from
variable rate to fixed rate obligations. Under the terms of
these agreements, we made payments at a fixed rate of 5.5% and
received payments from the counterparty based on the notional
amount of $100.0 million at a variable rate based on LIBOR.
The net interest paid or received on this arrangement was
included in interest expense. The fair value of these agreements
was based upon the estimated amount that we would have to pay to
terminate the agreements, as determined by the financial
institutions. The fair value of these agreements was an
unrealized loss of $1.3 million at March 29, 2003, all
of which was reclassified into earnings during Fiscal 2004.

As of April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004, the Company was
party to the following contracts (Dollars in millions):

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

We lease office, warehouse and retail space and office equipment
under operating leases which expire through 2029. As of
April 2, 2005, aggregate minimum annual rental payments
under noncancelable operating leases with lease terms in excess
of one year were payable as follows:

Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively, net of sub-lease
income. Substantially all outlet and retail store leases provide
for contingent rentals based upon sales and require us to pay
taxes, insurance and occupancy costs. Certain rentals are based
solely on a percentage of sales. Contingent rental charges
included in rent expense were $9.5 million,
$8.1 million and $6.9 million in Fiscal 2005, Fiscal
2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. These rental amounts exclude
associated costs such as real estate taxes and common area
maintenance.

Employment Agreements

We are party to employment agreements with certain executives
which provide for compensation and certain other benefits. The
agreements also provide for severance payments under certain
circumstances.

Acquisitions

See Note 3 for information regarding contingent payments
related to acquisitions made by the Company.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We sell our merchandise primarily to major upscale department
stores across the United States and extend credit based on an
evaluation of the customer’s financial condition generally
without requiring collateral. Credit risk is driven by
conditions or occurrences within the economy and the retail
industry and is principally dependent on each customer’s
financial condition. A decision by the controlling owner of a
group of stores or any substantial customer to decrease the
amount of merchandise purchased from us or to cease carrying our
products could have a material adverse effect. We had three
customers who in aggregate constituted approximately 44.9% and
40.1% of trade accounts receivable outstanding at April 2,
2005 and April 3, 2004, respectively.

We had three significant customers who accounted for
approximately 18.0%, 17.3% and 15.8% each of worldwide wholesale
net sales in Fiscal 2005. These three significant customers
accounted for approximately 14.1%, 13.2% and 10.4% each of net
sales in Fiscal 2004, and for approximately 12.5%, 9.7% and 8.4%
each of net sales in Fiscal 2003. Additionally, we had four
significant licensees who in aggregate constituted approximately
38%, 50% and 51% of licensing revenue in Fiscal 2005, Fiscal
2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively.

F-31


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our
customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We
believe that adequate provision for credit loss has been made in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

We are also subject to concentrations of credit risk with
respect to our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities,
interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign exchange
contracts which we attempt to minimize by entering into these
arrangements with major banks and financial institutions and
investing in high-quality instruments. We do not expect any
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Declaration of Dividends

On May 20, 2003, the Board of Directors initiated a regular
quarterly cash dividend program of $0.05 per share, or
$0.20 per share on an annual basis, on Polo Ralph Lauren
common stock. The fourth quarter dividend was payable to
shareholders of record at the close of business on April 1,
2005 and was paid on April 15, 2005.

outstanding during the reported period. Diluted EPS includes
additional dilution from potential common stock issuable
pursuant to the exercise of stock options, restricted stock and

treasury stock method. The weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding used to calculate Basic EPS is reconciled to
those shares used in calculation Diluted EPS as follows:

Common Stock

All of our outstanding Class B common stock is owned by
Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities and all of our
formerly outstanding Class C common stock was owned by
certain investment funds affiliated with The Goldman Sachs

common stock are convertible at any time into

F-32


POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and
may not be transferred to anyone other than affiliates of
Mr. Lauren. Shares of Class C common stock were
convertible at any time into shares of Class A common stock
on a one-for-one basis. During Fiscal 2003, 11.0 million
shares of Class C common stock were converted into
Class A common stock and sold in a secondary stock
offering. During Fiscal 2004, the remaining Class C shares
held by GS Group were converted into Class A common stock
and sold in a secondary stock offering. There is no longer any
Class C common stock outstanding. The holders of
Class A common stock generally have rights identical to
holders of Class B common stock except that holders of
Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and
holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes
per share. Holders of all classes of common stock entitled to
vote will vote together as a single class on all matters
presented to the stockholders for their vote or approval except
for the election and the removal of directors and as otherwise
required by applicable law.

In March 1998, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase,
subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of
our Shares. Share repurchases were made in the open market over
the two-year period which commenced April 1, 1998. The
Board of Directors has authorized the extension of the stock
repurchase program through April 1, 2006. Shares acquired
under the repurchase program will be used for stock option
programs and for other corporate purposes. The repurchased
shares have been accounted for as treasury stock at cost. As of
April 2, 2005, we had repurchased 4,087,906 Shares at
an aggregate cost of $77.5 million. No shares were
repurchased under the stock repurchase program during Fiscal
2005. On February 2, 2005, we announced that our Board of
Directors had approved an additional stock repurchase plan which
allows for the purchase of up to an additional
$100.0 million in our stock. The new repurchase plan does
not have a termination date. Certain employees tendered stock in
satisfaction of federal and state withholding taxes incurred due
to the vesting of shares granted under our stock incentive plan.
These transactions are treated as stock repurchases and amounted
to approximately $1.0 million in Fiscal 2005.

17.

Stock Incentive Plans

On June 9, 1997, our Board of Directors adopted the 1997
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (Stock Incentive Plan). The Stock
Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of awards to any officer or
other employee, consultant to, or director with respect to a
maximum of 10.0 million shares of our Class A common
stock (“Shares”), subject to adjustment to avoid
dilution or enlargement of intended benefits in the event of
certain significant corporate events, which awards may be made
in the form of: (i) nonqualified stock options;
(ii) stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock
options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code;
(iii) stock appreciation rights; (iv) restricted stock
and/or restricted stock units; (v) performance awards; and
(vi) other stock-based awards. On June 13, 2000, our
Board of Directors increased the maximum number of Shares that
can be granted under the Stock Incentive Plan to
20.0 million Shares, which was approved by the stockholders
on August 17, 2000. At April 2, 2005, we had
approximately 3.3 million Shares reserved for issuance
under this plan.

On June 9, 1997, our Board of Directors adopted the 1997
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (Non-Employee
Directors Plan). Under the Non-Employee Directors Plan, grants
of options to purchase up to 500,000 Shares may be granted
to non-employee directors. In Fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 our
Board of Directors granted options to purchase 21,000,
22,500, and 18,000 Shares with exercise prices equal to the
stock’s fair market value on the date of grant. At
April 2, 2005, we had approximately 341,000 shares
reserved for issuance under this plan.

Stock options were granted under the plans with an exercise
price equal to the stock’s fair market value on the date of
grant. These options vest in equal installments primarily over
two years for officers and other key employees and over three
years for all remaining employees and non-employee directors.

In June 2004, the Compensation Committee granted 100,000
restricted stock units, payable solely in shares of our
Class A Common Stock, under our Stock Incentive Plan. This
was the second of five annual grants pursuant to an employment
agreement. Each grant vests on the fifth anniversary of the
grant date, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances,
including termination of the executive’s employment after
the end of Fiscal 2008 for any reason other than termination by
the Company for cause, and is payable following the termination
of the executive’s employment. Additional restricted stock
units are issued in respect of outstanding grants as dividend
equivalents in connection with the payment of dividends on our
Class A Common Stock. In June 2004, an aggregate of
approximately 230,000 performance based restricted stock units
and approximately 1.4 million options to purchase shares of
our Class A Common Stock were granted to certain employees
under the Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted stock units will
vest in Fiscal 2008, subject to the Company’s satisfaction
of performance goals, and the options will vest in three equal
installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
The exercise price of the options is the fair market value of
the Class A Common Stock on the grant date. In July 2004,
the Company issued an aggregate of 437,500 restricted stock
units under our Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to an employment
agreement. Of these units,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

187,500 are performance based and will vest over the next three
years, subject to the Company’s satisfaction of performance
goals, and 250,000 will vest in three equal installments at the
end of Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2010 and will be paid
upon the termination of the executive’s employment. These
units are entitled to dividend equivalents, and the employment
agreement provides for the grant of up to an additional 562,500
performance based units that would vest, subject to the
Company’s achievement of performance goals for periods
ending at the close of Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2010.

On October 1, 2004, the Company issued 75,000 restricted
shares of Class A Common Stock and options to
purchase 200,000 shares of Class A Common Stock
pursuant to an employment agreement. The restricted stock will
vest in equal installments on the first five anniversaries of
the grant dates. An additional 75,000 options to
purchase 75,000 shares of Class A Common Stock
were granted under our Stock Incentive Plan to new hires during
the Fiscal 2005.

Total stock compensation expense, for the year ended
April 2, 2005 was $12.9 million, compared to
$4.1 million for the year ended April 3, 2004.

During Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, the Company realized a tax
benefit due to the exercise of stock options of
$18.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively.

In September 2003, the compensation committee of our Board of
Directors modified, subject to the employee’s continued
employment through March 31, 2004, certain outstanding
stock options as part of an employee’s retirement. The
vesting of certain options granted with respect to
100,000 shares, that would otherwise have vested in June
2004, was accelerated to March 31, 2004, and the exercise
period of options to purchase 342,000 shares, that
would otherwise expire upon the employee’s retirement date,
was extended to June 30, 2005. Total compensation expense
related to these modifications and recorded in Net income in
Fiscal 2004 was $0.3 million.

In June 2003, a grant of 100,000 restricted stock units was made
under our Stock Incentive Plan, and a total of 541 restricted
stock units were granted during Fiscal 2004 in respect of the
initial grant in connection with the payment of quarterly cash
dividends on our common stock. An additional 100,000 restricted
stock units will be granted on each anniversary of the first
grant date pursuant to an employment agreement with an initial
term ending on the last day of Fiscal 2008, and additional units
(the “dividend units”) will be granted in respect of
the then outstanding restricted stock units in connection with
each cash dividend paid on our common stock. The restricted
stock units vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date
(with the dividend units vesting with the underlying restricted
stock units in respect of which they are granted) and will be
payable solely in shares of common stock following termination
of employment. The vesting of all then outstanding unvested
restricted stock units will be accelerated if termination of
employment occurs after the last day of Fiscal 2008, except in
the case of termination by the company for cause. The unearned
compensation in respect of the grants made during the initial
term is being amortized over the period ending on that date.

In July 2002, 300,000 Shares of restricted stock were
granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. These shares are subject
to restrictions on transfer and the risk of forfeiture until
earned, and vest as follows: 20% on each of the first five
anniversaries of the grant date. The unearned compensation is
being amortized over a period equal to the anticipated vesting.

In April 2000, 118,299 Shares of restricted stock were
granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. These shares are subject
to restrictions on transfer and the risk of forfeiture until
earned, and vest as follows: 25% each on the second, third,
fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. The unearned
compensation is being amortized over a period equal to the
anticipated vesting.

Employee Benefits

Profit Sharing Retirement
Savings Plans

We sponsor two defined contribution benefit plans covering
substantially all eligible United States employees not covered
by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include a
savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. We make discretionary contributions to the plans
and contribute an amount equal to 50% of the first 6% of an
employee’s contribution.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is 100% vested in
our matching and discretionary contributions after five years of
credited service. Contributions under these plans approximated
$3.9 million, $4.4 million and $3.1 million in
Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively.

Supplemental Retirement
Plan

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for
certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the
401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans are expected to
be constrained by the operation of certain Internal Revenue Code
limitations. These supplemental benefits vest over time and the
compensation expense related to these benefits is recognized
over the vesting period. The amounts accrued under these plans
were $21.2 million and $17.5 million at April 2,
2005 and April 3, 2004, and are reflected in other
noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. Total compensation expense related to these benefits was
$3.7 million, $3.8 million and $1.4 million in
Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. This
liability is partially funded through whole-life policies, which
had cash surrender values of $13.3 million and
$12.5 million at April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004,
and are reflected in other assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred Compensation

We have deferred compensation arrangements for certain key
executives which generally provide for payments upon retirement,
death or termination of employment. The amounts accrued under
these plans were $2.2 million and $4.0 million at
April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004, and are reflected in
other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Total compensation expense related to these
compensation arrangements was $0.4 million for Fiscal 2005
and $0.7 million each year for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003.
We fund a portion of these obligations through the establishment
of trust accounts on behalf of the executives participating in
the plans. The trust accounts are reflected in other assets in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Union Pension

We participate in a multi-employer pension plan and are required
to make contributions to the Union of Needletrades Industrial
and Textile Employees (“Union”) for dues based on
wages paid to union employees. A portion of these dues is
allocated by the Union to a retirement fund which provides
defined benefits to substantially all unionized workers. We do
not participate in the management of the plan and have not been
furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits
provided, vested and nonvested benefits or assets.

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a
multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its
proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits.
Such withdrawal liability was assumed in conjunction with the
acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee. We
have no current intention of withdrawing from the plan.

Segment Reporting

The Company has three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail and
Licensing. The Company’s reportable segments are business
units that offer different products and services or similar
products through different channels of distribution. The
Wholesale segment consists of women’s, men’s and
children’s apparel and related products which are sold to
major department stores and specialty stores and to our owned
and licensed retail stores in the United States and overseas.
The retail segment consists of the Company’s worldwide
retail operations which sells our products through our full
price and outlet stores as well as Polo.com, our e-commerce
site. The stores and the website sell our products purchased
from our licensees, our suppliers and our wholesale segment. The
Licensing segment, which consists of product, international and
home, generates revenues from royalties through its licensing
alliances. The licensing agreements grant the licensee rights to
use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture
and sale of designated products in specified geographical areas.

The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with
those described in Note 1. Intersegment sales and transfers
are recorded at cost and treated as transfer of inventory. All
intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation. We do not
review these sales when evaluating segment performance. We
evaluate each segment’s performance based upon operating
income before interest, foreign currency gains and losses,
restructuring charges, one-time items, such as the
$100 million litigation reserve in 2005, and income taxes.
In conjunction with an evaluation of our overall segment
reporting, we have changed our method of allocating corporate
expenses to each segment to more appropriately reflect those
corporate expenses directly related to segments. Therefore,
Corporate overhead expenses, exclusive of expenses for senior
management, overall branding related expenses and certain other
corporate related expenses, are allocated to the segments based
upon specific usage or other allocation methods beginning with
the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. As a result of this change,
all prior year segment results have been restated to reflect how
management currently views the business.

The income tax effect related to foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow and
foreign currency hedges, was a charge of $8.7 million and a
benefit of $6.6 million in the year ended April 2,
2005, respectively. The income tax effect related to foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses
on cash flow and foreign currency hedges was a charge of
$1.8 million and a benefit of $15.7 million for the
year ended April 3, 2004, respectively.

The Company has several hedges in place at April 2, 2005
primarily relating to inventory purchases, royalty payments and
net investment in foreign subsidiaries. All of the hedges are
considered highly effective and as a result the entire change in
the fair market value of each hedge is recorded in unrealized
gains and losses on hedging derivatives, a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income, until the hedged
transaction is realized in results of operations, which is
generally, when inventory purchases are made or royalty payments
are remitted to the U.S. The unrealized gains and losses on
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries will be realized in
results of operations when the bonds providing the hedge are
repaid or the investment is liquidated. The Eurobonds mature in
November 2006, while the forward contracts extend through March
2006 for inventory purchases and February 2008 for the royalty
payments. As of April 2, 2005, the amount of unrealized
gain (loss) on the forward contracts which is expected to be
realized in pretax results of operations during Fiscal 2006 is a
gain of $1.9 million and a loss of $4.7 million
attributable to inventory

Legal Proceedings

As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel Group, Inc.
(including its subsidiaries, “Jones”) to meet the
minimum sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2002
under the license agreements for the sale of products under the
“Ralph” trademark between us and Jones dated
May 11, 1998, these license agreements terminated as of
December 31, 2003. We advised Jones that the termination of
these license agreements would automatically result in the
termination of the license agreements between us and Jones with
respect to the “Lauren” trademark pursuant to the
Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement between us and Jones
dated May 11, 1998. The terms of the Lauren license
agreements would otherwise have expired on December 31,
2006.

On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit against us in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York alleging, among other
things, that we had breached the Lauren license agreements by
asserting our rights pursuant to the Cross Default and Term
Extension Agreement, and that we induced Ms. Jackwyn
Nemerov, the former President of Jones, to breach the
non-compete and confidentiality clauses in
Ms. Nemerov’s employment agreement with Jones. Jones
stated that it would treat the Lauren license agreements as
terminated as of December 31, 2003, and is seeking
compensatory damages of $550.0 million, punitive damages
and enforcement of Ms. Nemerov’s agreement. Also on
June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Jones in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking, among other
things, an injunction and a declaratory judgement that the
Lauren license agreements would terminate as of
December 31, 2003 pursuant to the terms of the Cross
Default and Term Extension Agreement. The two lawsuits were
consolidated.

On July 3, 2003, we filed a motion to dismiss Jones’
claims regarding breach of the “Lauren” agreements and
a motion to stay the claims regarding Ms. Nemerov pending
the arbitration of Jones’ dispute with Ms. Nemerov. On
July 23, 2003, Jones filed a motion for summary judgement
in our action against Jones, and on August 12, 2003, we
filed a cross-motion for summary judgement. Oral argument on the
motions was heard on September 30, 2003. On March 18,
2004, the Court entered orders (i) denying our motion to
dismiss Jones’ claims against us for breach of the Lauren
agreements and (ii) granting Jones’ motion for summary
judgement in our action for declaratory judgement that the
Lauren agreements terminated on December 31, 2003 and
dismissing our complaint. The order also stayed Jones’
claim against us relating to Ms. Nemerov pending
arbitration regarding her alleged breach of her employment
agreement. On August 24, 2004, the Court denied our motion
to reconsider its orders, and on October 4, 2004, we filed
our appeal of the orders.

POLO RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On March 24, 2005, the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court affirmed the lower court’s orders. On April 22,
2005, we filed a motion with the Appellate Division for
reargument and/or permission to appeal its decision to the New
York Court of Appeals. On June 23, 2005, the Appellate
Division denied our request for reargument but granted our
motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. If the Court
of Appeals does not reverse the Appellate Division’s
decision, the case would go back to the lower court for a trial
on damages. Although we intend to continue to defend the case
vigorously, in light of the Appellate Division’s decision
we recorded a litigation charge of $100.0 million during
Fiscal 2005. This charge represents management’s best
estimate at this time of the loss incurred to date. No discovery
has been held and the ultimate outcome of this matter could
differ materially from the reserved amount.

We are subject to various claims relating to allegations of a
security breach of our retail point of sale system, including
fraudulent credit card charges, the cost of replacing cards and
related monitoring expenses and other related claims. The
Company is unable to predict whether further claims will be
asserted. The Company has contested and will continue to
vigorously contest the claims made against it and continues to
explore its defenses and possible claims against others. The
Company recorded a reserve of $6.2 million representing
management’s best estimate of the loss incurred in the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 relating to this matter.

The ultimate outcome of these matters could differ from the
amounts recorded and could be material to the results of
operations for any affected reporting period. Management does
not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material
impact on the Company’s liquidity.

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of the
Company’s stores filed a lawsuit against us and our Polo
Retail, LLC subsidiary in the United States District Court for
the District of Northern California alleging violations of
California antitrust and labor laws. The plaintiff purports to
represent a class of employees who have allegedly been injured
by a requirement that certain retail employees purchase and wear
Company apparel as a condition of their employment. The
complaint, as amended, seeks an unspecified amount of actual and
punitive damages, disgorgement of profits and injunctive and
declaratory relief. The Company answered the amended complaint
on November 4, 2002. A hearing on cross motions for summary
judgement on the issue of whether the Company’s policies
violated California law took place on August 14, 2003. The
Court granted partial summary judgement with respect to certain
of the plaintiff’s claims, but concluded that more
discovery was necessary before it could decide the key issue as
to whether the Company had maintained for a period of time a
dress code policy that violated California law. The parties are
engaged in settlement discussion, and we have recorded a
liability for our best estimate of the settlement cost, which is
not material.

On April 14, 2003, a second putative class action was filed
in the San Francisco Superior Court. This suit, brought by
the same attorneys, alleges near identical claims to these in
the federal class action. The class representatives consist of
former employees and the plaintiff in the federal court action.
Defendants in this class action include us and our Polo Retail,
LLC, Fashions Outlet of America, Inc., Polo Retail, Inc. and
San Francisco Polo, Ltd. subsidiaries as well as a
non-affiliated corporate defendant and two current managers. As
in the federal action, the complaint seeks an unspecified amount
of action and punitive restitution of monies spent, and
declaratory relief. The state court class action has been stayed
pending resolution of the federal class action.

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit against the United
States Polo Association Inc., Jordache, Ltd. and certain other
entities affiliated with them, alleging that the defendants were
infringing on our famous trademarks. In connection with this
lawsuit, on July 19, 2001, the United States Polo
Association and Jordache filed a lawsuit against us in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. This suit, which is effectively a counterclaim by them in
connection with the original trademark action, asserts claims
related to our actions in connection with our pursuit of claims
against the United States Polo Association and Jordache for
trademark infringement and other unlawful conduct. Their claims
stem from our

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

contacts with the United States Polo Association’s and
Jordache’s retailers in which we informed these retailers
of our position in the original trademark action. All claims and
counterclaims have now been settled, except for the
Company’s claims that the defendants violated the
Company’s trademark rights. We did not pay any damages in
this settlement. On July 30, 2004, the Court denied all
motions for summary judgement and set a trial date for
October 3, 2005.

On December 5, 2003, United States Polo Association, USPA
Properties, Inc., Global Licensing Sverige and Atlas Design AB
(collectively, “USPA”) filed a Demand for Arbitration
against the Company in Sweden under the auspices of the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution seeking a
declaratory judgement that USPA’s so-called Horseman symbol
does not infringe on Polo Ralph Lauren’s trademark and
other rights. No claim for damages was stated. On
February 19, 2004, we answered the Demand for Arbitration,
contesting the arbitrability of USPA’s claim for
declaratory relief. We also asserted our own counterclaim,
seeking a judgement that the USPA’s Horseman symbol
infringes on our trademark and other rights. We also sought
injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount.

On November 1, 2004, the arbitral panel of the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution hearing the
arbitration between us and the United States Polo Association,
United States Polo Association Properties, Inc., Global
Licensing Sverige and Atlas Design AB (collectively,
“USPA”) in Sweden rendered a decision rejecting the
relief sought by USPA and holding that their so-called Horseman
symbol infringes on our trademark and other rights. The arbitral
tribunal awarded us damages in excess of 3.5 million
Swedish Krona, or $0.5 million, and ordered USPA to
discontinue the sale of, and destroy all remaining stock of,
clothing bearing its Horseman symbol in Sweden. This amount has
not yet been recorded as income.

On October 29, 2004, we filed a Demand for arbitration
against the United States Polo Association and United States
Polo Association Polo Properties, Inc. in the United Kingdom
under the auspices of the International Centre for Dispute
Resolution seeking a judgement that the Horseman symbol
infringes on our trademark and other rights, as well as
injunctive relief. Subsequently, the Unites States Polo
Association and United States Polo Association Properties, Inc.
agreed not to distribute products bearing the Horseman symbol in
the United Kingdom or any other member nation of the European
Community. Consequently, we withdrew our arbitration demand on
December 7, 2004.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims
involving trademark and intellectual property, licensing,
employee relations and other matters incidental to our business.
We believe that the resolution of these other matters currently
pending will not individually or in aggregate have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Subsequent Event

On May 23, 2005, the Company entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire from Reebok International, Ltd all the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren
Footwear Co., Inc, its global licensee for men’s,
women’s and children’s footwear, as well as certain
foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok International Ltd
(“the Footwear Business”). The purchase price for the
acquisition of the Footwear Business will be approximately
$110 million in cash payable at closing, subject to closing
adjustments. Payment of the Purchase Price will be funded by
cash on hand and lines of credit as required. In addition, the
Footwear Licensee and certain of its affiliates have entered
into a transition services agreement with the Company to provide
a variety of operation, financial and information systems
services over a period of twelve to eighteen months.

The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to customary
conditions, including the receipt of certain third party
consents and the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976. The closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in
July 2005.
