PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, founded in 1967 by Ralph Lauren,
    is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of
    premium lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s
    and children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. We believe that our global reach, breadth of
    product and multi-channel distribution is unique among luxury
    and apparel companies. We operate in three distinct but
    integrated segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. The
    following tables show our net revenues and operating profit
    (excluding unallocated corporate expenses and legal and

Over the past five fiscal years, our sales have grown to
    $5.019 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $3.305 billion in
    Fiscal 2005. This growth has been largely a result of both our
    acquisitions and organic growth. We have diversified our
    business by channels of distribution, price point and target
    consumer, as well as by geography. Our global reach is one of
    the broadest in the apparel industry, with Ralph Lauren-branded
    merchandise available at approximately 6,100 different retail
    locations worldwide. In addition to our wholesale distribution,
    we sell directly to customers throughout the world via 326
    full-price and factory retail stores and our

e-commerce

websites, RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com.

We continue to invest in our business. In the past five fiscal
    years, we have invested approximately $2.0 billion for
    acquisitions and capital improvements, primarily through strong
    operating cash flow. We intend to continue to execute our
    long-term strategy of expanding our presence internationally,
    extending our direct-to-consumer reach, and expanding our
    accessories and other product offerings. See
    Item 7 —

“Overview

—

Our
    Objectives and Risks”

for further discussion of the
    Company’s long-term strategy.

We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding
    of our Company. As of March 28, 2009, Mr. Ralph
    Lauren, or entities controlled by Mr. Ralph Lauren, owned
    approximately 86% of the voting power of the outstanding common
    stock of the Company.

Seasonality
    of Business

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with
    higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth
    quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third
    quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of
    seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel,
    back-to-school and holiday shopping periods in the Retail
    segment. As a result of the growth and other changes in our
    business, along with changes in consumer spending patterns and
    the macroeconomic environment, historical quarterly operating
    trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of
    future performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales,
    operating income and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be
    affected by, among other things, the timing of seasonal
    wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working
    capital typically increases during the first half of the fiscal
    year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling
    periods and, accordingly, typically decreases during the second
    half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash
    provided by operating



activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal
    year due to higher net income and reduced working capital
    requirements during that period.

Recent
    Developments

Agreement
    to Acquire Southeast Asia Licensed Operations

In February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with
    Dickson Concepts International Limited (“Dickson”) to
    assume direct control of its Polo-branded licensed apparel
    businesses in Southeast Asia effective January 1, 2010 in
    exchange for a payment of $20 million and certain other
    consideration. Dickson is currently the Company’s licensee
    for Polo-branded apparel in the Southeast Asia region, which is
    comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
    Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In connection with
    this agreement, the Company entered into a one-year extension of
    its underlying sub-license agreement with Dickson, which was
    originally scheduled to expire on December 31, 2008. The
    transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions.

Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition

On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the
    Polo-branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan
    from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai
    Co. Ltd. (“Naigai”) in exchange for a payment of
    approximately ¥2.8 billion (approximately
    $26 million as of the acquisition date) and certain other
    consideration (the “Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition”). The Company funded the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on-hand.
    Naigai was the Company’s licensee for childrenswear, golf
    apparel and hosiery under the

Polo by Ralph Lauren

and

Ralph Lauren

brands in Japan. In conjunction with the
    Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, the Company also
    entered into an additional

5-year

licensing and design-related agreement with Naigai for Polo and
    Chaps-branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services
    agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human
    resources and information systems-related services over a period
    of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the
    transaction.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded childrenswear and
    golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the
    Company’s results of operations commencing August 2,
    2008.

    sporting heritage. From rebellious, sport-inspired looks for men
    to sharp, sexy campus styles for women, Rugby embraces a lasting
    sense of timeless individuality and offers apparel and
    accessories for everyday wear — from rugbys, polos,

    the world of fragrance, launching Lauren for women and Polo for
    men. Since then, Ralph Lauren Fragrance has captured the essence
    of Ralph Lauren’s men’s and women’s brands, from
    the timeless heritage of Lauren and Polo to the sophisticated
    beauty of Polo Black for men and Romance for women to the
    modern, fresh Ralph fragrances for her, designed to appeal to a
    younger audience. Men’s fragrances include Safari, Polo

Our
    Wholesale Segment

Our Wholesale segment sells our products to leading upscale and
    certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores and golf
    and pro shops, both domestically and internationally. We have
    focused on elevating our brand and improving productivity by
    reducing the number of unproductive doors within department
    stores in which our products are sold, improving in-store
    product assortment and presentation, and improving full-price
    sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2009, our
    Ralph Lauren-branded products were sold through approximately
    6,100 doors worldwide and during Fiscal 2009, we invested
    approximately $35 million in related shop-within-shops
    primarily in domestic and international department and specialty
    stores.

Department stores are our major wholesale customers in North
    America. In Europe, our wholesale sales are a varying mix of
    sales to both department stores and specialty shops, depending
    on the country. Our collection brands — Women’s
    Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label and Men’s Purple
    Label Collection and Black Label — are distributed
    through a limited number of premier fashion retailers. In
    addition, we sell excess and out-of-season products through
    secondary distribution channels, including our retail factory
    stores.

In Japan, our products are distributed primarily through
    shop-within-shops at premiere department stores. The mix of
    business is weighted to Polo Ralph Lauren in Men’s and
    Women’s Blue Label. The distribution of Men’s and
    Women’s Black Label is also expanding through
    shop-within-shop presentations in top tier department stores
    across Japan.

Worldwide
    Distribution Channels

The following table presents the approximate number of doors by
    geographic location, in which Ralph Lauren-branded products
    distributed by our Wholesale segment were sold to consumers in
    our primary channels of distribution as of March 28, 2009:

In addition, American Living and Chaps-branded products
    distributed by our Wholesale segment were sold through
    approximately 1,700 doors domestically as of March 28, 2009.

We have seven key department-store customers that generate
    significant sales volume. For Fiscal 2009, these customers in
    the aggregate accounted for approximately 50% of all wholesale
    revenues, with Macy’s, Inc. representing approximately 19%
    of these revenues.

Our product brands are sold primarily through their own sales
    forces. Our Wholesale segment maintains its primary showrooms in
    New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in
    Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, London,
    Munich, Madrid and Stockholm.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical
    element of our distribution to department stores, we and our
    licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand
    recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines
    by the department stores and to differentiate the presentation
    of products. Shop-within-shops fixed assets primarily include
    items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and
    components, decorative items and flooring.

As of March 28, 2009, we had approximately 10,000
    shop-within-shops dedicated to our Ralph Lauren-branded
    wholesale products worldwide. Excluding significantly larger
    shop-within-shops in key department store locations, the size of
    our shop-within-shops typically ranges from approximately 200 to
    6,000 square feet. We normally share in the cost of these
    shop-within-shops with our wholesale customers.

Basic Stock Replenishment
    Program.

Basic products such as knit shirts,
    chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered at any time
    through our basic stock replenishment programs. We generally
    ship these products within three-to-five days of order receipt.

Our
    Retail Segment

As of March 28, 2009, our Retail segment consisted of 163
    full-price retail stores and 163 factory stores worldwide,
    totaling approximately 2.5 million square feet, and two

e-commerce

websites. The extension of our direct-to-consumer reach is a
    primary long-term strategic goal. We opened 16 new full-price
    stores and closed 8 full-price stores in Fiscal 2009. Our
    full-price retail stores reinforce the luxury image and distinct
    sensibility of our brands and feature exclusive lines that are
    not sold in domestic department stores. We operated the
    following full-price retail stores as of March 28, 2009:

Our
    Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight,
    design, and marketing skills with the specific product or
    geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and
    build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners
    who:

•

are leaders in their respective markets;

•

contribute the majority of the product development costs;



•

provide the operational infrastructure required to support the
    business; and

•

own the inventory.

We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell
    at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more
    of our trademarks. We grant our international geographic area
    licensing partners exclusive rights to distribute certain brands
    or classes of our products and operate retail stores in specific
    international territories. These geographic area licensees
    source products from us, our product licensing partners and
    independent sources. Each licensing partner pays us royalties
    based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a
    minimum royalty requirement for the right to use the
    Company’s trademarks and design services. In addition,
    licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of
    their revenues to advertise our products and share in the
    creative costs associated with these products. Larger
    allocations are required in connection with launches of new
    products or in new territories. Our licenses generally have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that their
    products are developed, marketed and distributed so as to reach
    the intended market opportunity and to present consistently to
    consumers worldwide the distinctive perspective and lifestyle
    associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design,
    production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution,
    advertising and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject
    to our prior approval and continuing oversight. The result is a
    consistent identity for Ralph Lauren products across product
    categories and international markets.

Approximately 29% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2009 was
    derived from three licensing partners: Luxottica Group, S.p.A.
    (11%), L’Oreal S.A. (9%) and Peerless, Inc. (9%).

    in the U.S.;

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell,
    promote, market

and/or

distribute various categories of our products in a given
    geographic area. These rights may include the right to own and
    operate retail stores. The economic arrangements are similar to
    those of our product licensing partners. We design licensed
    products either alone or in collaboration with our domestic
    licensing partners. Our product licensees, whose territories do
    not include the international geographic area licensees’
    territories, generally provide our international licensing
    partners with product or patterns, piece goods, manufacturing
    locations and other information and assistance necessary to
    achieve product uniformity, for which they are often compensated
    by these partners.

As of March 28, 2009, our international licensing partners
    operated 90 Ralph Lauren stores and 63 Club Monaco stores and
    dedicated shops.

Ralph
    Lauren Home

brands in three primary categories:
    bedding and bath, home décor and home improvement. As of
    March 28, 2009, we had agreements with 10 domestic and 2
    international home product licensing partners and one
    international home product sublicensing partner.

We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home
    licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners.
    These services include design, operating showrooms, marketing,
    advertising and, in some cases, sales. In general, the licensing
    partners manufacture and own the inventory, and ship the
    products. Our Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances generally
    have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the upper tiers of
    their respective markets and are offered at a range of price
    levels. These products are generally distributed through several
    channels of distribution, including department stores, specialty
    home furnishings stores, interior design showrooms, customer
    direct mail catalogs, home centers and the Internet, as well as
    our own stores. As with our other products, the use of
    shop-within-shops is central to our department store
    distribution strategy.

Product
    Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of
    American style with a strong international appeal. Our
    consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an
    important contributor to the prominence, strength and reputation
    of the Ralph Lauren brands.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the
    direction of, Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which is
    divided into nine departments: Menswear, Women’s
    Collection, Women’s Ready to Wear, Dresses,
    Children’s, Accessories, Home, Club Monaco and Rugby. We
    form design teams around our brands and product categories to
    develop concepts, themes and products for each brand and
    category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales
    and production staff, these teams support all three segments of
    our business — Wholesale, Retail and
    Licensing — in order to gain market and other valuable
    input.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing program communicates the themes and images of our
    brands and is an integral feature of our product offering.
    Worldwide marketing is managed on a centralized basis through
    our advertising and public relations departments in order to
    ensure consistency of presentation.

We create distinctive image advertising for all of our products,
    conveying the particular message of each brand within the
    context of our core themes. Advertisements generally portray a
    lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of
    products offered by ourselves and, in some cases, our licensing
    partners. Our primary advertising medium is print, with multiple
    page advertisements appearing regularly in a range of fashion,
    lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major print
    advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and spring
    retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to coincide
    with product deliveries. In addition to print, some product
    categories have utilized television and outdoor media in their
    marketing programs. Our RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com

e-commerce

websites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle on the Internet
    while offering the full breadth of our apparel, accessories and
    home products.



We advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate
    in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major
    retailers. In addition, we provide point-of-sale fixtures and
    signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation
    of our products at retail locations. We expensed approximately
    $171 million related to the advertising of our products in
    Fiscal 2009, a decrease of approximately 9% from Fiscal 2008.

When our domestic licensing partners are required to spend an
    amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on
    advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their
    behalf.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each
    of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at
    major fashion shows in New York City, which typically generate
    extensive domestic and international media coverage. We
    introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at
    major fashion shows in cities such as New York or Milan, Italy.
    In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our models,
    certain professional golfers and sponsors. We are the first
    exclusive outfitter for all on-court officials at the Wimbledon
    tennis tournament. We are also the official outfitter of all
    on-court officials at the U.S. Open tennis tournament.

In May 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with the
    U.S. Olympic Committee which designated Polo Ralph Lauren
    as an Official Outfitter of the 2008 U.S. Olympic and
    Paralympic Teams. Under this agreement, the Company designed the
    official opening ceremony and closing ceremony parade outfits
    for the U.S. Olympic teams members at the 2008 Summer
    Olympics in China, in addition to an assortment of village wear
    pieces provided to the athletes on the U.S. Teams.

In April 2009, the Company entered into a binding Letter of
    Intent (“LOI”) with the United States Olympic
    Committee (“USOC”) to be the exclusive Official Parade
    Outfitter for the 2010 and 2012 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic
    Teams. In addition to furnishing the Official Parade Outfits for
    the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2010 and 2012 Olympic
    Games, the Company also has the right to provide leisure/village
    wear (“Leisure Wear”) to the USOC Teams and to
    manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote and sell products in
    the United States which replicate the Parade Outfits and Leisure
    Wear.

Sourcing,
    Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own
    or operate any production facilities. Over 350 different
    manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear and
    accessories products, with no one manufacturer providing more
    than 8% of our total production during Fiscal 2009. We source
    both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include
    fabric, buttons and other trim. Finished products consist of
    manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to
    our customers. In Fiscal 2009, less than 2%, by dollar volume,
    of our products were produced in the U.S., and over 98%, by
    dollar volume, were produced outside the U.S., primarily in
    Asia, Europe and South America. See

“Import Restrictions
    and other Government Regulations”

and
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business — Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.”

Most of the businesses in our Wholesale segment must commit to
    manufacture our garments before we receive customer orders. We
    also must commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance
    of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers’
    demand for a particular product, we may sell the excess in our
    factory stores or sell the product through secondary
    distribution channels. If we overestimate the need for a
    particular fabric or yarn, that fabric or yarn may be used in
    garments made for subsequent seasons or made into past
    seasons’ styles for distribution in our factory stores.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global
    manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia,
    the Americas and Europe. All garments are produced according to
    our specifications. Production and quality control staff in the
    Americas, Asia and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier
    facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the
    final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor
    certification and compliance programs, so that quality assurance
    is focused upon as early as possible in the production process,
    allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution
    facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.



Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and
    consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with
    numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic and foreign.
    Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
    substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on
    the basis of fashion, quality and service, which depend on our
    ability to:

•

anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely
    manner;

•

maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

develop and produce high quality products that appeal to
    consumers;

•

appropriately price our products;

•

provide strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensure product availability; and

•

obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present our
    products at retail.

    worldwide apparel industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution in the U.S., Ralph Lauren products
    are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution
    centers for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment to retail
    customers. This network includes our distribution center in
    Greensboro, North Carolina, third party logistics
    centers — primarily in Chino Hills,
    California — and, for Childrenswear products, a leased
    distribution center in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Our
    full-price store, factory store and Club Monaco shipments are
    distributed through this network. All facilities are designed to
    allow for high density cube storage and utilize bar code
    technology to provide inventory management and controls.
    European distribution has been consolidated into one third party
    facility located in Parma, Italy. Japan logistics have been
    consolidated into one third party facility in Kawasaki.

RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com customer contact functions and
    order fulfillment are performed at a leased facility in High
    Point, North Carolina.

Management
    Information Systems

Our management information systems make the marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution of our products more
    efficient by providing, among other things:

•

comprehensive order processing;

•

production information;

•

accounting information; and

•

an enterprise view of information for our marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution functions.

The point-of-sale registers in conjunction with other systems in
    our stores enable us to track inventory from store receipt to
    final sale on a real-time basis. We believe our merchandising
    and financial systems, coupled with our point-of-sale registers
    and software programs, allow for stock replenishment, effective
    merchandise planning and real-time inventory accounting. See
    Item 1A — “

Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business —
    Certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters could adversely
    impact our results of operations.”

We also utilize an automated replenishment system, Logility, to
    facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our
    Retail segment and wholesale customers, the movement of goods
    through distribution channels, and the collection of information
    for planning and forecasting. We have a collaborative
    relationship with



many of our suppliers that enables us to reduce cash-to-cash
    cycles in the management of our inventory. See
    Item 1A — “

Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business

—

Our business could suffer if our computer
    systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate
    effectively.”

Wholesale
    Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise
    primarily to major department stores and extend credit based on
    an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels
    and the financial condition of our customers on a continuing
    basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor our accounts
    receivables or maintain credit insurance to manage the risks of
    bad debts. Collection and deduction transactional activities are
    principally provided through a third party service provider. Our
    bad debt expenses were approximately $14 million in Fiscal
    2009, representing less than 1 percent of net revenues but
    higher than our historical experience due largely to the
    negative effects of the slowdown in the global economy on the
    financial condition and liquidity of our customer base. See
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors — Risks
    Related to Our Business

—

Our business could be
    negatively impacted by any financial instability of our
    customers.”

Wholesale
    Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products
    approximately three to five months prior to the time the
    products are delivered to stores. Such orders are generally
    subject to broad cancellation rights. As of March 28, 2009,
    our total backlog was $1.289 billion, compared to
    $1.573 billion as of March 29, 2008. We expect that
    substantially all of our backlog orders as of March 28,
    2009 will be filled within the next fiscal year. The size of our
    order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the
    timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which
    a significant percentage of our orders are received, and the
    timing of shipments. As a consequence, a comparison of the size
    of our order backlog from period to period may not be
    necessarily meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual
    shipments. Nevertheless, the decrease in our order backlog from
    the prior year is associated in part with a reduction in
    customer orders relating to the contraction in consumer spending
    expected to continue during Fiscal 2010.

Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph Lauren”,
    “Polo by Ralph Lauren Design” and the famous polo
    player astride a horse trademarks in the U.S. and
    approximately 100 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we
    similarly own include:

•

“Lauren Ralph Lauren”;

•

“Lauren”;

•

“Purple Label”;

•

“Pink Pony”;

•

“Ralph”;

•

“RRL”;

•

“Club Monaco”;

•

“Rugby”;

•

“RLX”;

•

“Chaps”;

•

“American Living”; and

•

Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.



Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as
    trademarks “Ralph Lauren,” “Double RL” and
    “RRL” in perpetuity in connection with, among other
    things, beef and living animals. The trademarks “Double
    RL” and “RRL” are currently used by the Double RL
    Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. In addition,
    Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects
    involving film or theatrical productions (not including or
    relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a
    company wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these
    companies has no impact on us.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations and pending
    applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items
    of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings,
    restaurant and café services, online services and online
    publications and beauty products, as well as in connection with
    retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage
    and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks
    remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in
    connection with the related products and services and the
    required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license
    to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to
    the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our
    products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect
    them against infringement (see Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion). As
    a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been
    the object of counterfeiting. We have a broad enforcement
    program which has been generally effective in controlling the
    sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in major
    markets abroad.

In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our
    trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our
    international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with
    various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in
    certain trademarks, including “Polo”

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, which impede
    our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such
    conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we
    continue our international expansion, we have generally
    successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both
    legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners
    of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our
    Business

—

Our trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected
    outside the U.S.”

and Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion).
    Although we have not in the past suffered any material
    restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable
    markets, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not
    arise in the future as we expand product offerings and
    additional trademarks to new markets.

Import
    Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the U.S., Canada,
    and Europe is subject to duties. Until January 1, 2008,
    much of our apparel merchandise was also subject to safeguard
    quotas. Notwithstanding quota elimination, China’s
    accession agreement for membership in the WTO provided that WTO
    member countries (including the U.S., Canada and European
    countries) could reimpose quotas on specific categories of
    products in the event it is determined that imports from China
    surged and threatened to create a market disruption for such
    categories of products (so called “safeguard quota
    provisions”). Such safeguard quotas were permissible
    through January 1, 2008. From January 1, 2008 through
    January 1, 2011, WTO member countries can reimpose
    merchandise-specific safeguard quota. No such quotas are
    currently in effect. In addition, effective January 1,
    2008, the European Union agreed with China on a new textile
    arrangement which imposed a double surveillance licensing scheme
    which terminated at the end of calendar year 2008. The
    U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose
    additional duties in response to a particular product being
    imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded
    prices that in such increased quantities as to cause (or
    threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally
    known as “anti-dumping” actions). The European Union
    has imposed certain anti-dumping duties on imports from China
    and Vietnam in certain footwear categories. Canada currently
    also has an anti-dumping proceeding on footwear under
    consideration. If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the
    U.S. Government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf
    of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly
    affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally
    known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the
    U.S. Government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign
    government to foreign manufactures if the importation of such
    subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a
    U.S. industry. Recent developments have now made it
    possible to impose countervailing duties on products from
    non-market economies, such as China, which could significantly
    increase our costs.



We are also subject to other international trade agreements and
    regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,
    the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean
    Basin Initiative. In addition, each of the countries in which
    our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports.
    Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our
    products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time,
    impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls
    or restrictions, including the imposition of “safeguard
    quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates
    or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of
    import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our
    potential exposure to import related risks through, among other
    measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts
    of production among countries and manufacturers, as well as
    through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all our products are manufactured by foreign
    suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the
    administration of current international trade regulations,
    executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in
    sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quota could
    adversely affect our operations. Although we generally expect
    that the 2005 elimination of quotas will result, over the long
    term, in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced
    abroad, the implementation of any “safeguard quota
    provisions” or any “anti-dumping” or
    “countervailing duty” actions may result, over the
    near term, in cost increases and in disruption of the supply
    chain for certain products categories. See
    Item 1A — “

Risk Factors”

below
    for further discussion.

Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to
    regulation in the U.S. and other countries by other
    governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade
    Commission, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer
    Products Safety Commission, including the recently enacted
    Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (“CPSIA”)
    which imposes new limitations on the permissible amounts of lead
    and phthalates allowed in children’s products. These
    regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing
    requirements, flammability testing, and product safety
    particularly with respect to products used by children. We
    believe that we are in substantial compliance with those
    regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and
    foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of
    materials hazardous to the environment. We do not estimate any
    significant capital expenditures for environmental control
    matters either in the current year or in the near future. Our
    licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to
    regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to
    operate in compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are
    not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected
    to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
    operations.

Although we have not suffered any material restriction from
    doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot
    assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future
    as we expand product offerings and introduce additional
    trademarks to new markets.

Employees

As of March 28, 2009, we had approximately
    17,000 employees, both full and part-time, consisting of
    approximately 12,000 in the U.S. and approximately 5,000 in
    foreign countries. 30 of our U.S. production and
    distribution employees in the womenswear business are members of
    UNITE HERE (which was previously known as the Union of
    Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, prior to its
    merger with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
    International Union) under an industry association collective
    bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has
    adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and
    non-union employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
    The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking
    statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
    business, our prospects, our operating results, our financial
    condition, the trading prices of our securities and the actual
    outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are
    made in this report. Additional risks that we do not yet know of
    or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our
    business operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The loss
    of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or other key personnel
    could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing
    and operational areas of our business has been a critical
    element of our success since the inception of our Company. The
    death or disability of Mr. Lauren or other extended or
    permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or
    industry perception with respect to him or arising from his
    loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our
    other executive officers and other members of senior management
    have substantial experience and expertise in our business and
    have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
    The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these
    individuals could also adversely affect us. We are not protected
    by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance
    covering Mr. Lauren, our other executive officers and
    certain other members of senior management. We have entered into
    employment agreements with Mr. Lauren and our other
    executive officers, but the noncompete period with respect to
    Mr. Lauren and certain other executive officers could, in
    some circumstances in the event of their termination of
    employment with the Company, end prior to the employment term
    set forth in their employment agreements.

Our
    business could be negatively impacted by any financial
    instability of our customers.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department
    stores across the U.S. and Europe and extend credit based
    on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial
    difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or
    eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more
    credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables. In the
    aggregate, our seven largest department-store customers
    constituted approximately 40% of our gross trade accounts
    receivable outstanding as of March 28, 2009 and contributed
    approximately 50% of all wholesale revenues for Fiscal 2009. Our
    inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any
    one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on
    our business or financial condition. See Item 1 —

“Business

—

Wholesale Credit
    Control.”

The
    current economic crisis could have a negative impact on our
    major customers and suppliers which in turn could materially
    adversely affect our results of operations and
    liquidity.

The current economic crisis is having a significant negative
    impact on businesses around the world. Although we believe that
    our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity
    under our revolving credit facility will provide us with
    sufficient liquidity through the current economic crisis, the
    impact of this crisis on our major customers and suppliers
    cannot be predicted and may be quite severe. The inability of
    major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our
    ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers.
    A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to
    access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall
    deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a
    significant reduction in their future orders of our products and
    the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment
    obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations and liquidity.

We cannot
    assure the successful implementation of our growth
    strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands,
    expand our geographic coverage and increase direct management of
    our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically
    acquiring or integrating select licenses previously held by our
    licensees and enhancing our operations. Implementation of our
    strategy involves the



continued expansion of our business in Europe, Asia and other
    international areas. As discussed in Item 1 —

“Business — Recent Developments,”

on
    August 1, 2008, we acquired our previously licensed
    childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan. In Fiscal
    2008, we acquired a controlling interest in Impact 21 Co., Ltd.
    (“Impact 21”) and the remaining 50% interest in Polo
    Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (“PRL Japan”). We also
    acquired our previously licensed belts and leather goods
    business in April 2007 and the remaining 50% interest in Ralph
    Lauren Media, LLC (“RL Media”) in March 2007.

Also, as discussed in Item 1 —

“Business

—

Recent Developments,”

in February
    2009, we entered into an agreement with Dickson to assume direct
    control of our Polo-branded licensed apparel businesses in
    Southeast Asia effective January 1, 2010.

We may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our
    operations, hiring and retaining qualified key employees, or
    otherwise successfully managing such expansion. Furthermore, we
    may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any
    licensee that we acquire into our own business or achieve any
    expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.

In Fiscal 2008, we launched

American Living

, a new
    lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for
    JCPenney. The success of

American Living

and the
    introduction of new product categories in both the U.S. and
    overseas may be negatively impacted in Fiscal 2010 by the
    contraction in consumer spending associated with the current
    weakened global economic environment. See
    Item 7 —

“Overview — Global
    Economic Developments”

for further discussion.

Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation
    and expansion of our retail distribution network, both in the
    U.S. and abroad, which are subject to many factors beyond
    our control. We may not be able to procure, purchase or lease
    desirable free- standing or department store locations, or renew
    and maintain existing free-standing store leases and department
    store locations on acceptable terms, or secure suitable
    replacement locations. The lease negotiation as well as the
    number and timing of new stores actually opened during any given
    period, and their associated contribution to net income for the
    period, depends on a number of factors including, but not
    limited, to: (i) the availability of suitable financing to
    us and our landlords; (ii) the timing of the delivery of
    the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to
    commence build-out construction activities; (iii) our
    ability and our landlords’ ability to obtain all necessary
    governmental licenses and permits to construct and operate our
    stores on a timely basis; (iv) our ability to manage the
    construction and development costs of new stores; (v) the
    rectification of any unforeseen engineering or environmental
    problems with the leased premises; (vi) adverse weather
    during the construction period; and (vii) the hiring and
    training of qualified operating personnel in the local market.
    While we continue to explore new markets and are always
    evaluating new potential locations, any of the above factors
    could have an adverse impact on our financial operations.

In Europe, we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we
    have in the U.S., and we may have difficulty developing
    successful distribution strategies and alliances in each of the
    major European countries. In Japan, our primary mode of
    distribution is via a network of shops located within the
    leading department stores. We may have difficulty in
    successfully retaining this network, and expanding into
    alternate distribution channels. Additionally, macroeconomic
    trends may not be favorable, and could limit our ability to
    implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we
    have foreign operations, such as Europe and Asia.

Our
    business could suffer as a result of consolidations,
    liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the
    retail industry.

Several of our department store customers, including some under
    common ownership, account for significant portions of our
    wholesale net sales. We believe that a substantial portion of
    sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing
    partners, including sales made by our sales force of Ralph
    Lauren Home products, are also made to our largest department
    store customers. In the aggregate, our seven largest
    department-store customers accounted for approximately 50% of
    our wholesale net sales during Fiscal 2009. There can be no
    assurance that consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations
    or other ownership changes in the department store sector will
    not have a material adverse effect on our wholesale business.



We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
    commitments with our customers for each of our lines every
    season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores
    or any other significant customer, whether motivated by
    competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
    decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from
    us or our licensing partners; or to change their manner of doing
    business with us or our licensing partners or their new
    strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued
    focus on further development of their “private label”
    initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business or financial condition.

Our
    profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on
    margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure
    caused by many factors, including intense competition,
    consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to
    reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending
    patterns. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices
    to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin
    to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory
    levels

and/or

otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in
    our operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to
    sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our
    profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Certain
    legal proceedings and regulatory matters could adversely impact
    our results of operations.

We are involved in certain legal proceedings and are subject
    from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of
    contract claims, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain
    of our retail store information systems, employment issues,
    consumer matters and other litigations. Certain of these
    lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by
    us, could result in material liability to the Company or have a
    negative impact on the Company’s reputation or relations
    with its employees, customers, licensees or other third parties.
    In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or
    regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in
    substantial costs and may require that the Company devotes
    substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further,
    changes in governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in
    other countries where we conduct business operations could have
    an adverse impact on our results of operations. See
    Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for
    further discussion of the Company’s legal matters.

Our
    business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are
    disrupted or cease to operate effectively.

The Company relies heavily on its computer systems to record and
    process transactions and manage and operate our business. We
    also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the
    processing of basic replenishment orders from our wholesale
    customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels,
    and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
    In addition, we have

e-commerce

and other Internet websites in the U.S. Given the
    complexity of our business and the significant number of
    transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is
    imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer
    hardware and software systems. Despite our preventative efforts,
    our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or
    interruption from, among other things, security breaches,
    computer viruses or power outages.

Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.

As of March 28, 2009, we source a significant portion of
    our products outside the U.S. through arrangements with
    over 350 foreign vendors in various countries. In Fiscal 2009,
    over 98%, by dollar value, of our products were produced outside
    the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. Risks
    inherent in importing our products include:

•

quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements with China and
    non-WTO countries. These agreements limit the amount and type of
    goods that may be imported annually from these countries;

•

changes in social, political and economic conditions or
    terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from
    the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are
    located;

•

the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or
    exports;

•

the imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports or exports;



•

significant fluctuations of the cost of raw materials;

•

significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security
    considerations;

•

the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings
    resulting in the potential assessment of special antidumping or
    countervailing duties; and

•

the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties
    either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy
    perceived illegal actions by national governments.

Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
    ability to conduct business in international markets may be
    affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
    risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets
    and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing
    international markets is subject to risks associated with
    international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.

We are also subject to general political and economic risks in
    connection with our international operations, including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other
    similar restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European
    Union, Asia, or other countries upon the import or export of our
    products in the future, or what effect any of these actions
    would have on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social or
    economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse
    effect on our business in the future or may require us to
    significantly modify our current business practices.

Our
    trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
    adequately protected outside the U.S.

We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are
    extremely important to our success and our competitive position.
    We devote substantial resources to the establishment and
    protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities
    worldwide. Significant counterfeiting of our products continues,
    however, and in the course of our international expansion we
    have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have
    acquired or claimed ownership rights in some trademarks that
    include Polo

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise
    have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past
    resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action
    and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken
    to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary
    rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material
    adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation
    of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and
    proprietary rights of others. Also, there can be no assurance
    that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of,
    trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will
    be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
    satisfaction or at all. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
    countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
    as do the laws of the U.S. See Item 1 —

“Business

—

Trademarks,”

and
    Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings.”



Our
    business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer’s
    inability to produce our goods on time and to our
    specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend
    exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of
    all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our
    specifications primarily by international manufacturers. During
    Fiscal 2009, less than 2%, by dollar value, of our men’s
    and women’s products were manufactured in the U.S. and
    over 98%, by dollar value, of these products were manufactured
    in other countries. The inability of a manufacturer to ship
    orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality
    standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements
    of our customers for those items, which could result in
    cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a
    substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use
    acceptable labor practices.

We require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers
    to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote
    ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and
    monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do
    not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The
    violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer
    used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence
    of an independent manufacturer’s or licensing
    partner’s labor practices from those generally accepted as
    ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt, or
    otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or
    damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if we need to replace
    manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the production capacity of
    our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these
    competitors have greater financial and other resources than we
    have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for
    production and import quota capacity. If we experience a
    significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
    of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party
    manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional
    capacity will be available when required on terms that are
    acceptable to us. See Item 1 —

“Business

—

Sourcing, Production and Quality.”

We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each
    season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design
    and quality specifications and other standard industry
    provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any
    manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our
    products exclusively.

Our
    business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency
    fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars.
    However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result,
    the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the
    value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
    rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
    currency denominated prices at which our international
    businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales
    and licensing revenue generally is derived from sales in foreign
    currencies. These foreign currencies include the Japanese Yen,
    the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, and this revenue could
    be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Although we
    hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot
    assure that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a
    material adverse impact on our financial condition and results
    of operations. See Item 7 —

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

—

Market
    Risk Management.”

We rely
    on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our
    licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our
    licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks
    specific to a licensing partner’s business, including, for
    example, risks associated with a particular licensing
    partner’s ability to:

•

obtain capital;



•

manage its labor relations;

•

maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively; and

•

maintain relationships with its customers.

Although a number of our license agreements prohibit licensing
    partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our
    competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded
    from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered
    by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of
    sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are
    also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
    control over our licensing partners’ products and
    advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other
    things, operational and financial control over their businesses.
    Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor
    execution or financial difficulties with respect to any of our
    licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Business

—

Our
    Licensing Segment.”

Failure
    to maintain licensing partners could harm our
    business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we could replace
    existing licensing partners if necessary, our inability to do so
    for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Our Licensing Segment.”

The
    voting shares of the Company’s stock are concentrated in
    one majority stockholder.

As of March 28, 2009, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities
    controlled by Mr. Ralph Lauren, owned approximately 86% of
    the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company.
    As a result, Mr. Lauren has the ability to exercise
    significant control over our business, including, without
    limitation, (i) the election of the Company’s
    Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a
    class, and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our
    stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our
    certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or
    sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

The
    trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall
    based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other
    financial performance.

Our business planning process is designed to maximize our
    long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an
    earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe
    that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the
    Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we
    recognize that from time to time it may be helpful to provide
    investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast
    of net sales and earnings. While we generally expect to provide
    updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal
    quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our
    forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. If and
    when we announce actual results that differ from those that have
    been predicted by us, outside analysts or others, the market
    price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on
    the predictions when making investment decisions with respect to
    our securities do so at their own risk. We take no
    responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such
    changes in the prices of our securities.

Risks
    Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete

The
    downturn in the global economy may continue to affect consumer
    purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products,
    which could adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic
    factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer
    spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance, accessories and
    home products industries, including, among others:

•

general business conditions;



•

economic downturns;

•

employment levels;

•

downturns in the stock market;

•

interest rates;

•

the housing market;

•

consumer debt levels;

•

the availability of consumer credit;

•

increases in fuel prices;

•

taxation; and

•

consumer confidence in future economic conditions.

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail
    products, including our products, may continue to decline during
    recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income
    is lower. A continuing downturn or an uncertain outlook in the
    economies in which we, or our licensing partners, sell our
    products may materially adversely affect our businesses and our
    revenues and profits. See Item 7 —

“Overview

—

Our Objectives and
    Risks”

for further discussion.

The domestic and international political situation also affects
    consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of
    terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to
    a decrease in consumer spending.

We face
    intense competition in the worldwide apparel industry.

We face a variety of intense competitive challenges from other
    domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual apparel
    producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more
    diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources
    than we have. We compete with these companies primarily on the
    basis of:

•

anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors
    and styles that appeal to consumers;

•

appropriately pricing products;

•

failure to anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;

•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain
    efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective
    presentation of our products at retail stores.

We also face increasing competition from companies selling
    apparel and home products through the Internet. Although RL
    Media sells our products domestically through the Internet,
    increased competition in the worldwide apparel, accessories and
    home product industries from Internet-based competitors could
    reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our
    results of operations.

The
    success of our business depends on our ability to respond to
    constantly changing fashion trends and consumer
    demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate
    and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as
    to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of
    consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with
    certainty and are



subject to rapid change. We cannot assure you that we will be
    able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully
    meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future. In
    addition, we cannot assure you that any new products or brands
    that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers.
    Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and respond
    effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends
    could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our
    products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold
    inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be
    forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of
    excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business and
    impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate
    consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to
    supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience
    inventory shortages, which may result in unfilled orders,
    negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty
    and result in lost revenues. See Item 1

    and Quality.”

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

On October 11, 2007 and November 2, 2007, two class
    action lawsuits were filed by two customers in state court in
    California asserting that while they were shopping at certain of
    the Company’s factory stores in California, the Company
    allegedly required them to provide certain personal information
    at the point-of-sale in order to complete a credit card
    purchase. The plaintiffs purported to represent a class of
    customers in California who allegedly were injured by being
    forced to provide their address and telephone numbers in order
    to use their credit cards to purchase items from the
    Company’s stores, which allegedly violated
    Section 1747.08 of California’s Song-Beverly Act. The
    complaints sought an unspecified amount of statutory penalties,
    attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. The Company
    subsequently had the actions moved to the United States District
    Court for the Eastern and Central Districts of California. The
    Company commenced mediation proceedings with respect to these
    lawsuits and on October 17, 2008, the Company agreed in
    principle to settle these claims by agreeing to issue $20
    merchandise discount coupons with six month expiration dates to
    eligible parties and paying the plaintiffs’ attorneys’
    fees. The terms of the final settlement remain subject to court
    approval. In connection with this settlement, the Company
    recorded a $5 million reserve against its expected loss
    exposure during the second quarter of Fiscal 2009.

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd.
    (“Wathne”), our domestic licensee for luggage and
    handbags, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren,
    our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other
    things, federal trademark law violations, breach of contract,
    breach of obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and
    negligent misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other
    relief, injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the Court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. We believe this lawsuit to be without
    merit, and moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims.
    Wathne cross-moved for partial summary judgment. A hearing on
    these motions occurred on November 1, 2007. The judge
    presiding in this case provided a written ruling on the summary
    judgment motion on April 11, 2008. The Court granted
    Polo’s summary judgment motion to dismiss in large measure,
    and denied Wathne’s cross-motion. Wathne appealed the
    dismissal of its claims and a hearing in connection with this
    appeal was held before the Appellate Division of the Supreme
    Court on May 19, 2009. A ruling from the Appellate Division
    with respect to this appeal is not expected for several months.
    A trial date has not yet been established in connection with
    this matter. We intend to continue to contest the remaining
    claims in this lawsuit vigorously. Accordingly, management does
    not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or
    financial position.

On March 2, 2006, a former employee at our Club Monaco
    store in Los Angeles, California filed a lawsuit against the
    Company in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiff
    purported to represent a class of Club Monaco store employees
    who allegedly were injured by being improperly classified as
    exempt employees and thereby did not receive compensation for
    overtime and did not receive meal and rest breaks. The complaint
    sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    disgorgement of profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    relief. On August 21, 2007, eleven former and then current
    employees of the Company’s Club Monaco stores in California
    filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging similar
    claims as the Club Monaco action in San Francisco. The
    complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    attorneys’ fees and punitive damages. The parties to these
    two Club Monaco litigations agreed to retain a mediator in an
    effort to resolve both matters and agreed to settle all claims
    involving both litigations at an aggregate cost of
    $1.2 million. The terms of the settlement were recently
    approved by both the Los Angeles and San Francisco courts.

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs
    purport to represent a class of employees who allegedly have
    been injured by not properly being paid commission earnings, not
    being paid overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to
    work off of the clock while waiting to enter or leave the store
    and being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave the store.
    The complaint seeks



an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, damages for
    emotional distress, disgorgement of profits, punitive damages,
    attorneys’ fees and injunctive and declaratory relief. We
    have filed a cross-claim against one of the plaintiffs for his
    role in allegedly assisting a former employee to misappropriate
    Company property. Subsequent to answering the complaint, we had
    the action moved to the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California. On July 8, 2008, the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California granted plaintiffs’ motion for class
    certification. We believe this suit is without merit and intend
    to contest it vigorously. Accordingly, management does not
    expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or
    financial position.

On May 15, 2009, the Company’s subsidiary, Club Monaco
    Corp., commenced an action in the Supreme Court of the State of
    New York, New York County, against LCJG Distribution Co., Ltd.
    (“LCJG”) and Lane Crawford Joyce Group Limited
    (“Lane Crawford”). LCJG is a Club Monaco Corp.
    licensee in Asia pursuant to a Club Monaco Store License
    Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2005 (as amended, the
    “License Agreement”). Lane Crawford is the guarantor
    of LCJG’s obligations under the License Agreement, pursuant
    to a Guaranty, dated as of February 28, 2005, which was
    executed by Lane Crawford (the “Guaranty”). The
    License Agreement requires that LCJG pay royalties and other
    payments to Club Monaco Corp. for the use by LCJG of the Club
    Monaco brand in connection with the operation of various Club
    Monaco stores in Asia. Club Monaco Corp.’s Complaint
    alleges that LCJG and Lane Crawford have breached the License
    Agreement and Guaranty by, among other things, failing to pay
    Club Monaco certain royalties and other payments which both LCJG
    and Lane Crawford are responsible for under the License
    Agreement and Guaranty. Management does not expect that the
    ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s liquidity, financial position or
    results of operations.

In the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company was notified of
    an alleged compromise of its retail store information systems
    that process its credit card data for certain Club Monaco stores
    in Canada. As of the end of Fiscal 2007, the Company had
    recorded a total reserve of $5.0 million for this matter
    based on its best estimate of its potential exposure at that
    time. In October 2008, the Company was notified that this matter
    had been fully resolved. The Company’s aggregate losses in
    this matter were less than $0.4 million. The Company
    reversed $4.1 million of its original $5.0 million
    reserve into income during Fiscal 2008 based on favorable
    developments in this matter at that point, and the remaining
    $0.5 million excess reserve was reversed into income during
    the second quarter of Fiscal 2009.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims and
    proceedings involving credit card fraud, trademark and
    intellectual property, licensing, employee relations and other
    matters incidental to our business. We believe that the
    resolution of these other matters currently pending will not
    individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition or results of operations.

On May 20, 2003, our Board of Directors initiated a regular
    quarterly cash dividend program of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per
    share on an annual basis, on our Class A common stock.
    Approximately $20 million was recorded as a reduction to
    retained earnings during Fiscal 2009 in connection with these
    dividends.

As of May 15, 2009, there were 1,136 holders of record of
    our Class A common stock and 16 holders of record of our
    Class B common stock. All of our outstanding shares of
    Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren and
    related entities and are convertible at any time into shares of
    Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.

During the fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2009, there were
    no shares repurchased by the Company as part of the publicly
    announced plans or programs. The remaining availability under
    the Company’s common stock repurchase program was
    approximately $266 million as of March 28, 2009.

The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder
    return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) on our
    Class A common stock with the cumulative total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and a peer group

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and
    distribution of premium lifestyle products including men’s,
    women’s and children’s apparel, accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishings. Our long-standing reputation
    and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    Our brand names include

Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren
    Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Collection, Black Label, Blue Label,
    Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren
    Childrenswear, American Living, Chaps

and

Club
    Monaco

, among others.



We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale,
    Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing
    approximately 57% of Fiscal 2009 net revenues) consists of
    wholesale-channel sales made principally to major department
    stores, specialty stores and golf and pro shops located
    throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. Our retail business
    (representing approximately 39% of Fiscal 2009 net
    revenues) consists of retail-channel sales directly to consumers
    through full-price and factory retail stores located throughout
    the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, and through
    our retail internet sites located at www.RalphLauren.com and
    www.Rugby.com. In addition, our licensing business (representing
    approximately 4% of Fiscal 2009 net revenues) consists of
    royalty-based arrangements under which we license the right to
    third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with
    the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as
    apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographical areas
    for specified periods. Approximately 28% of our Fiscal
    2009 net revenues was earned in international regions
    outside of the U.S. and Canada. See Note 21 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a
    summary of net revenues by geographic location.

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with
    higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth
    quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third
    quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of
    seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel,

back-to-school

and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment.

Our
    Objectives and Risks

Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury
    lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a
    proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed
    through multiple retail channels in global markets, a
    disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet.
    Despite the various risks associated with the deterioration in
    the global economic environment as further discussed below, we
    believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute
    our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net
    income and operating cash flow.

Our financial performance has been driven by the Company’s
    focus on six key objectives:

•

Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core
    and heritage-driven brand;

•

Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution
    channels and geographic regions;

•

Improving brand control and positioning;

•

Focusing on selective strategic partnerships;

•

Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a
    worldwide business; and

•

Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow.

As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control
    has evolved from primarily that of a mono-brand
    U.S. centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of
    product and geographic licenses to that of a portfolio of
    lifestyle brands with a “direct control” model over
    most of our brands, products and international territories. We
    believe that this broader and better-diversified portfolio mix
    positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers a range
    of products, price points and channels of distribution, and our
    size and global operations favorably position us to take
    advantage of synergies in design, sourcing and distribution.

While balancing our long-term key strategic objectives with our
    near-term priorities to manage through the many risks associated
    with the weakened global economic environment, including a
    significant contraction in consumer spending, we intend to
    continue to pursue select opportunities for growth during the
    course of Fiscal 2010 and beyond. These opportunities and
    continued investment initiatives include:

•

International Growth Opportunities

Ø

The transition of our wholesale and retail businesses in
    Southeast Asia from a licensed to a wholly owned operation
    effective January 1, 2010, and the development of a
    supporting organizational infrastructure; and

Ø

Ongoing development and integration of our recently acquired
    Japanese businesses, including the continued execution of our
    plans to build a supporting organizational infrastructure and
    retail business.



•

Brand Extension and Product Diversification Growth Opportunities

Ø

Further development of a wide array of luxury accessories
    product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small
    leathergoods and watches/jewelry; and

Ø

The continued expansion of our

Lauren

product line in
    Europe and other international markets.

•

Direct-to-Consumer

Growth Opportunities

Ø

Global expansion of our

direct-to-consumer

presence in various formats and key markets, including Paris,
    France.

•

Cost Savings Opportunities

Ø

The ongoing evaluation of strategies to better align our cost
    base with lower sales trends associated with the recent
    contraction in consumer spending.

Global
    Economic Developments

Our opportunities for long-term growth are accompanied by
    significant challenges and risks, particularly in the near term.
    Over the course of the past year, the global economic
    environment has deteriorated significantly and has evolved into
    what is commonly called a “global economic crisis.”
    Negative developments have included declining values in real
    estate, restricted criteria for obtaining credit and capital,
    liquidity concerns for most borrowers, the failure of certain
    major financial institutions, rising unemployment, and
    significant declines and volatility in global financial markets.
    In response to these unprecedented economic conditions, the
    United States and many other countries have taken a number of
    significant measures designed to stabilize the state of their
    financial systems. Notwithstanding these measures, consumer
    confidence in the U.S., as measured by the Conference Board, has
    been at all-time low levels.

The global economic crisis has negatively impacted to a
    significant degree the level of consumer spending for
    discretionary items over the course of the past year and through
    April 2009. This has negatively affected our business as it is
    highly dependent on consumer demand for our products. Despite
    the more challenging economic environment that affected both the
    Company’s wholesale customers and retail channels, we
    continued to experience reported revenue growth during Fiscal
    2009.

However, beginning in October 2008, our Retail segment began to
    experience sharp declines in comparative store sales, as did
    many of our traditional wholesale customers. In particular, our
    comparable store sales for the second half of Fiscal 2009
    declined approximately 23% for full-price Ralph Lauren sales,
    approximately 19% for full-price Club Monaco sales and
    approximately 6% for factory store sales. To realign our cost
    base with lower sales trends, the Company initiated a
    restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
    This plan included a reduction in workforce and the closure of
    certain underperforming retail stores. Cost reduction actions
    related to the restructuring plan are anticipated to result in
    annualized pretax cash savings of approximately $25 million
    beginning in Fiscal 2010. We also have mitigated the impact of
    the contraction in consumer spending by taking proactive
    measures to scale back our inventory levels across all channels,
    with inventory down approximately 2% at the end of Fiscal 2009
    compared to the prior year excluding the effects of acquisitions.

The global economic environment and the related contraction in
    the anticipated level of consumer spending will likely continue
    to have a negative effect on our sales and operating margins
    across all segments for the foreseeable future. As of
    March 28, 2009, largely in response to the global
    macroeconomic environment, our traditional retail partners have
    reduced their initial wholesale orders for Fall 2009 apparel
    products by approximately 10%.

We continue to evaluate strategies to control costs by focusing
    on operational efficiencies on a Company-wide basis, by
    conservatively managing our inventory levels, and by controlling
    capital spending. The implementation of these strategies may
    necessitate additional cost-savings actions going forward.

For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have
    the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially
    from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A —

“Risk Factors”

Summary
    of Financial Performance

Operating
    Results

During Fiscal 2009, we reported revenues of $5.019 billion,
    net income of $406.0 million and net income per diluted
    share of $4.01. This compares to revenues of
    $4.880 billion, net income of $419.8 million and net
    income per diluted share of $3.99 during Fiscal 2008. As
    discussed further below, the comparability of our operating
    results has been affected by recent acquisitions and
    $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009
    related to asset impairments and restructurings.

Our operating performance for Fiscal 2009 included revenue
    growth of 2.8%, principally due to the inclusion of a full year
    of revenues from the newly launched

American Living

product line, increased revenues from our European and
    Japanese Wholesale businesses, continued growth in
    RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com sales (collectively,
    “RalphLauren.com”), and net favorable foreign currency
    effects. These increases were partially offset by a net decline
    in comparable global Retail store sales and lower Wholesale
    sales to our traditional department and specialty store
    customers in the U.S. associated with the current weakened
    global economic environment. We also experienced an increase in
    gross profit percentage of 30 basis points to 54.4%,
    primarily due to the growth of our European and Japanese
    Wholesale operations, as well as the net decrease of unfavorable
    purchase accounting effects in our Wholesale and Retail
    segments. These increases were partially offset by increased
    markdown activity and higher reductions in the carrying cost of
    our retail inventory, largely relating to the current economic
    downturn. Selling, general and administrative
    (“SG&A”) expenses increased during Fiscal 2009
    attributable largely to our new business initiatives.

Net income declined during Fiscal 2009 as compared to Fiscal
    2008, principally due to a $57.9 million decrease in
    operating income, offset in part by a $40.8 million
    decrease in the provision for income taxes. The decrease in the
    provision for income taxes was driven by a 370 basis point
    decline in our effective tax rate and the overall decrease in
    pretax income. Net income per diluted share slightly increased
    compared to the prior fiscal year, as the effect of lower
    weighted-average diluted shares outstanding was mostly offset by
    the decrease in net income in Fiscal 2009. These results were
    negatively impacted by $79.0 million of pretax charges
    recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and
    restructurings, which had an aggregate effect of reducing net
    income in Fiscal 2009 by $49.7 million ($0.49 per diluted
    share).

Financial
    Condition and Liquidity

Our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of
    our business results. We ended Fiscal 2009 in a net cash and
    short-term investments position (total cash and cash
    equivalents, plus short-term investments less total debt) of
    $413.5 million, compared to a net debt position (total debt
    less total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments)
    of $53.4 million as of the end of Fiscal 2008.

The improvement in our financial position was primarily due to
    growth in operating cash flows, partially offset by our treasury
    stock repurchases, capital expenditures and the funding of our
    recent Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (as defined
    under

“Recent Developments”

). Our
    stockholders’ equity increased to $2.735 billion as of
    March 28, 2009, compared to $2.390 billion as of
    March 29, 2008. This increase was primarily due to our net
    income during Fiscal 2009, offset in part by our share
    repurchase activity.

We generated $774.2 million of cash from operations during
    Fiscal 2009, compared to $695.4 million during Fiscal 2008.
    We used our cash availability to support our common stock
    repurchase program, to reinvest in our business through capital
    spending, to fund our Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition for approximately $26.0 million, and to repay
    $196.8 million of debt that matured in May 2008 relating to
    our Japanese Business Acquisitions (as defined under

“Recent Developments”

). In particular, we used
    $169.8 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares of
    Class A common stock. We also spent $185.0 million for
    capital expenditures primarily associated with global retail
    store expansion, construction and renovation of department store
    shop-within-shops and investments in our facilities and
    technological infrastructure.



Transactions
    Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

The comparability of the Company’s operating results for
    the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by
    certain transactions, including:

•

Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008 and
    Fiscal 2007. In particular, the Company completed the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition on August 1, 2008, the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions on May 29, 2007, the Small
    Leathergoods Business Acquisition on April 13, 2007 and the
    RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition on March 28, 2007
    (each as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements);

•

Certain pretax charges related to asset impairments and
    restructurings during the fiscal years presented; and

•

The adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — An Interpretation of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”)
    No. 109” (“FIN 48”) as of the beginning
    of Fiscal 2008. The incremental impact of the adoption of
    FIN 48 decreased the effective tax rate by 97 basis
    points in Fiscal 2008. See Note 13 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion
    of the Company’s adoption of FIN 48.

A summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax
    income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below

The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as
    necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising
    from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or
    transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and
    other financial statement users individually should consider the
    types of events and transactions that have affected operating
    trends.

Recent
    Developments

Agreement
    to Acquire Southeast Asia Licensed Operations

In February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with
    Dickson Concepts International Limited (“Dickson”) to
    assume direct control of its Polo-branded licensed apparel
    businesses in Southeast Asia effective January 1, 2010 in
    exchange for a payment of $20 million and certain other
    consideration. Dickson is currently the Company’s licensee
    for Polo-branded apparel in the Southeast Asia region, which is
    comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
    Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In connection with
    this agreement, the Company entered into a one-year extension of
    its underlying

sub-license

agreement with Dickson, which was originally scheduled to expire
    on December 31, 2008. The transaction is subject to certain
    customary closing conditions. The Company expects to account for
    this transaction as an asset purchase during the fourth quarter
    of Fiscal 2010.

Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition

On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the
    Polo-branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan
    from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai
    Co. Ltd. (“Naigai”) in exchange for a payment of
    approximately ¥2.8 billion (approximately
    $26 million as of the acquisition date) and certain other
    consideration (the “Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition”). The Company funded the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on-hand.
    Naigai was the Company’s licensee for childrenswear, golf
    apparel and hosiery under the

Polo by Ralph Lauren

and

Ralph Lauren

brands in Japan. In conjunction with the
    Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition,



the Company also entered into an additional

5-year

licensing and design-related agreement with Naigai for Polo and
    Chaps-branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services
    agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human
    resources and information systems-related services over a period
    of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the
    transaction.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded childrenswear and
    golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the
    Company’s results of operations commencing August 2,
    2008.

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company acquired control of certain of
    its Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under
    licensed arrangements, consistent with the Company’s
    long-term strategy of international expansion. In particular,
    the Company acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares
    of Impact 21 Co., Ltd. (“Impact 21”) that it did not
    previously own in a cash tender offer (the “Impact 21
    Acquisition”), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact
    21 from approximately 20% to approximately 97%. Impact 21
    previously conducted the Company’s men’s, women’s
    and jeans apparel and accessories business in Japan under a
    pre-existing,

sub-license

arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (“PRL
    Japan”), which holds the master license to conduct
    Polo’s business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu
    (the “PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition”).
    Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan
    Minority Interest Acquisition are herein referred to as the
    “Japanese Business Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately
    $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately
    $12 million. In February 2008, the Company acquired
    approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares
    outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. During the
    first quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company acquired the remaining
    2% of Impact 21 shares outstanding at an aggregate cost of
    approximately $9 million and completed the process of
    acquiring the remaining outstanding shares not exchanged as of
    the close of the tender offer period (the “minority
    squeeze-out”). As a result of these transactions, Impact 21
    is a 100%-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and ¥20.5 billion of borrowings
    under a one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment
    and restatement to the Company’s existing credit facility.
    The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on
    May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of Impact 21’s
    cash on-hand acquired as part of the acquisition.

The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    within minority interest expense the amount of Impact 21’s
    net income allocable to the holders of the approximate 80% of
    the Impact 21 shares not owned by the Company prior to the
    closing date of the tender offer. The results of operations for
    PRL Japan had already been consolidated by the Company in all
    prior periods.

See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the
    Company’s acquisitions during the fiscal years presented.

American
    Living

In Fiscal 2008, the Company launched

American Living

, a
    new lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for
    distribution by J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“JCPenney”)
    through the Company’s Global Brand Concepts group. The
    Company began shipping related product to JCPenney in December
    2007. See

“Overview — Global Economic
    Developments.”

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $138.8 million, or 2.8%, to $5.019 billion in Fiscal
    2009 from $4.880 billion in Fiscal 2008. The increase was
    principally due to growth in our global Wholesale business,
    increased global Retail sales, and net favorable foreign
    currency effects. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net
    revenues increased by 2.2%. On a reported basis, Wholesale
    revenues increased by $129.1 million, primarily as a result
    of the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the newly
    launched

American Living

product line and increased
    revenues from our European and Japanese businesses, offset in
    part by decreased sales in our core domestic product lines.
    Retail revenues increased by $23.9 million primarily as a
    result of continued global store expansion and growth in
    RalphLauren.com sales, partially offset by a net decline in
    comparable store sales. Licensing revenue decreased by
    $14.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in international
    licensing royalties as a result of the Japanese Childrenswear
    and Golf Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion).

Wholesale net revenues

— The net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

a $74 million net increase in our European businesses on a
    constant currency basis driven by increased sales in our
    menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines, partially
    offset by an increase in promotional activity;

•

a $47 million net increase in our Japanese operations on a
    constant currency basis primarily as a result of the inclusion
    of revenues from the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    (see

“Recent Developments”

for further
    discussion), offset in part by sales declines in our core
    businesses; and

•

a $37 million net increase in revenues due to a favorable
    foreign currency effect related to the strengthening of the Yen,
    partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect
    related to the weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

a $29 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic
    businesses primarily due to reduced shipments across our core
    menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines as a result
    of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment (as
    discussed further in the

“Overview”

section).
    Offsetting this decrease was the inclusion of a full year of
    revenues from the newly launched

American Living

product
    line and an increase in footwear sales largely attributable to
    increased door penetration.

Retail net revenues

— For purposes of the
    discussion of Retail operating performance below, we refer to
    the measure “comparable store sales.” Comparable store
    sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for
    at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing
    during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of
    comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either
    relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage
    expansion of 25% or greater) or closed for 30 or more
    consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the
    calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have
    been in their location or in a newly renovated state for at
    least one full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information
    includes both Ralph Lauren (including Rugby) and Club Monaco
    stores.

The net increase in Retail net revenues primarily reflects:

•

an $81 million aggregate net increase in sales from
    non-comparable stores, primarily relating to new store openings
    within the past twelve months. There was a net increase in
    average global store count of 21 stores, to a total of 326
    stores, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The net increase
    in store count was primarily due to a number of new domestic and
    international full-price and factory store openings; and

•

a $27 million, or 18.7%, increase in RalphLauren.com sales.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

an $84 million aggregate net decrease in comparable store
    sales driven by our global full-price stores, including an
    aggregate net unfavorable foreign currency effect of
    $13 million primarily related to the



weakening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in
    Fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales are provided below:

Licensing revenue

— The net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

a $17 million decrease in international licensing
    royalties, primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition (see

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion).

The above decrease was partially offset by:

•

a $3 million increase in domestic licensing royalties,
    primarily driven by increases in men’s personal apparel and
    the inclusion of a full year of royalties for

American
    Living

. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
    in fragrance-related royalties.

Gross Profit.

Cost of goods sold includes the
    expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale,
    including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well
    as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory
    realizability. The costs of selling merchandise, including those
    associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as
    picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in
    SG&A expenses.

Gross profit increased by $92.6 million, or 3.5%, to
    $2.731 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $2.638 billion in
    Fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
    increased by 30 basis points to 54.4% in Fiscal 2009 from
    54.1% in Fiscal 2008, primarily driven by the growth of our
    European and Japanese wholesale operations, as well as the net
    decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects associated
    with prior business acquisitions. These increases were partially
    offset by increased markdown activity and higher reductions in
    the carrying cost of our retail inventory, largely as a result
    of the current economic downturn.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a
    variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix
    among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products
    sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs.
    These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses primarily include
    compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts,
    information technology, facilities, legal and other costs
    associated with finance and administration. SG&A expenses
    increased by $103.5 million, or 5.4%, to
    $2.036 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $1.932 billion in
    Fiscal 2008. The increase included a net unfavorable foreign
    currency effect of approximately $14 million, primarily
    related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the
    weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses as a percent
    of net revenues increased to 40.6% in Fiscal 2009 from 39.6% in
    Fiscal 2008. The 100 basis point increase was primarily
    driven by increased



operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives.
    The $103.5 million increase in SG&A expenses was
    primarily driven by:

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs of approximately
    $38 million related to our newly acquired Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf operations, including costs incurred
    pursuant to transition service arrangements (see

“Recent
    Developments”

for further discussion);

•

higher compensation-related expenses of approximately
    $35 million principally relating to increased selling costs
    associated with higher retail sales and our ongoing product line
    expansion, including

American Living

and a dedicated
    dress business across multiple brands. These increases were
    partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense
    largely driven by a decrease in the Company’s share price
    as of the date of its annual equity award grant in the second
    quarter of Fiscal 2009 compared to the share price as of the
    comparable grant date in Fiscal 2008;

•

an approximate $29 million increase in rent and utility
    costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses,
    including rent expense related to certain retail stores
    scheduled to open in Fiscal 2010;

•

an approximate $12 million net increase in
    litigation-related charges, including approximately
    $4 million related to the reversal of a reserve for credit
    card matters in Fiscal 2008; and

•

an approximate $11 million increase in bad debt expenses
    due largely to the negative effects of the slowdown in the
    global economy on the financial condition and liquidity of our
    customer base.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

an approximate $20 million decrease in brand-related
    marketing and advertising costs primarily as a result of the
    implementation of related cost-savings initiatives in response
    to the current economic downturn, as well as the absence of
    costs associated with the Company’s 40th Anniversary
    celebration in Fiscal 2008.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    decreased by $27.0 million, or 57.2%, to $20.2 million
    in Fiscal 2009 from $47.2 million in Fiscal 2008. The
    decrease was primarily due to the absence of the amortization of
    the licenses acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions,
    which were fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008. See

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion of
    the acquisitions.

Impairments of Assets.

An aggregate non-cash
    impairment charge of $55.4 million was recognized in Fiscal
    2009, compared to $5.0 million in Fiscal 2008. These
    charges reduced the net carrying values of certain long-lived
    assets, primarily in the Company’s Retail segment, to their
    estimated fair values. These impairment charges were primarily
    attributable to

lower-than-expected

operating performances in certain stores, which in Fiscal 2009,
    arose in large part due to the significant contraction in
    consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that
    fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $23.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2009 primarily
    associated with a restructuring plan initiated during the fourth
    quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better align the Company’s cost
    base with lower sales and operating margin trends associated
    with the recent slowdown in consumer spending, and to improve
    overall operating effectiveness (the “Fiscal 2009
    Restructuring Plan”). This Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan
    included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain
    underperforming retail stores. No restructuring charges were
    recorded in Fiscal 2008. See Note 12 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income decreased
    by $57.9 million, or 8.9%, to $595.5 million in Fiscal
    2009 from $653.4 million in Fiscal 2008. Operating income
    as a percentage of net revenues decreased 150 basis points
    to 11.9% in Fiscal 2009 from 13.4% in Fiscal 2008. The decrease
    in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily
    reflected increases in SG&A expenses, and
    $79.0 million of pretax charges related to asset
    impairments and restructurings, partially offset by a decrease
    in amortization of intangible assets, as previously discussed.

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $47.9 million primarily as a result of higher revenues, as
    well as improved gross margin largely driven by our European and
    Japanese wholesale operations. The increase also was due to the
    net decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects
    primarily associated with prior business acquisitions. These
    increases were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses
    attributable largely to our new business initiatives.

Retail operating income

decreased by $96.0 million
    primarily as a result of $47.0 million of higher
    impairment-related charges, higher reductions in the carrying
    cost of our retail inventory, and higher rent and occupancy
    costs. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues and
    the absence of certain unfavorable purchase accounting effects
    associated with the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition
    included in the prior fiscal year.

Licensing operating income

increased by $6.9 million
    primarily as a result of a decrease in amortization of
    intangible assets due to the absence of the amortization of the
    license acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which
    was fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008. Also contributing
    to the increased operating income was an increase in domestic
    licensing royalties, primarily driven by the inclusion of
    royalties for

American Living

. These increases were
    offset in part by a net decrease in international royalties
    primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    (see

“Recent Developments”

for further
    discussion).

Unallocated corporate expenses

decreased by
    $10.5 million primarily as a result of a decrease in
    brand-related marketing and advertising costs, as well as lower
    stock-based compensation expense, as previously discussed.

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

of
    $23.1 million in Fiscal 2009 were comprised of
    restructuring charges of $23.6 million primarily associated
    with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, as previously
    discussed, offset by a reversal of an excess reserve in the
    amount of $0.5 million related to the Credit Card Matter
    (as discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements). In Fiscal 2008, unallocated
    legal and restructuring charges were comprised of a reversal of
    an excess reserve in the amount of $4.1 million related to
    the Credit Card Matter.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain
    of $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to a loss of
    $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008. The prior fiscal year loss
    included a $1.6 million write-off of foreign currency
    option contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign
    currency exposure associated with the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions, which expired unexercised. Excluding the
    aforementioned transaction, foreign currency gains increased in
    Fiscal 2009 as compared to Fiscal 2008, primarily due to the
    timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and
    payables (that were not of a long-term investment nature)
    between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries.
    Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of
    changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating
    results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to
    U.S. dollars.



Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including
    amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our
    capital lease obligations. Interest expense increased by
    $0.9 million, to $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009 from
    $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008. This increase is primarily
    due to an increase in interest expense related to capital lease
    obligations, offset in part by a decrease in interest expense
    related to borrowings under a one-year term loan agreement
    repaid by the Company in May 2008.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, decreased by $2.7 million, to
    $22.0 million in Fiscal 2009 from $24.7 million in
    Fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by lower yields
    relating to lower market rates of interest in Fiscal 2009,
    offset in part by an increase in our average balance of cash and
    short-term investments during Fiscal 2009.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

The equity in loss of equity-method
    investees of $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 and
    $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 primarily related to certain

start-up

costs associated with the recently formed joint venture, the RL
    Watch Company, which the Company accounts for under the equity
    method of accounting.

Minority Interest Expense.

Minority interest
    expense of $2.1 million in Fiscal 2008 related to the
    Company’s remaining 50% interest in PRL Japan, which was
    acquired in May 2007, and the allocation of Impact 21’s net
    income to the holders of the 80% interest not owned by the
    Company prior to the closing date of the related acquisition. No
    minority interest expense was recorded in Fiscal 2009 as both of
    these companies are now wholly owned.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by
    $40.8 million, or 18.4%, to $181.5 million in Fiscal
    2009 from $222.3 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in
    provision for income taxes was principally due to an overall
    decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal
    2008. This decrease also was due to a reduction in our reported
    effective tax rate of 370 basis points, to 30.9% in Fiscal
    2009 from 34.6% in Fiscal 2008. The lower effective tax rate was
    primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings. In
    particular, there was a greater proportion of earnings generated
    in lower-taxed jurisdictions and the tax benefits associated
    with the asset impairment and restructuring charges were
    recognized in higher-taxed jurisdictions. The effective tax rate
    differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and
    local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain
    nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from
    year to year based on non-recurring factors including, but not
    limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and
    amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and
    local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the
    interaction of various global tax strategies.

Net Income.

Net income decreased by
    $13.8 million, or 3.3%, to $406.0 million in Fiscal
    2009 from $419.8 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in
    net income principally related to a $57.9 million decrease
    in operating income, offset in part by a $40.8 million
    decrease in the provision for income taxes, as previously
    discussed. These results were negatively impacted by
    $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009
    related to asset impairments and restructurings, which had an
    aggregate effect of reducing net income in Fiscal 2009 by
    $49.7 million.

Net Income Per Diluted Share.

Net income per
    diluted share increased by $0.02, or 0.5%, to $4.01 per share in
    Fiscal 2009 from $3.99 per share in Fiscal 2008, as the effect
    of lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding was mostly
    offset by the decrease in net income in Fiscal 2009. These
    results were negatively impacted by $79.0 million of pretax
    charges recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments
    and restructurings, which had an aggregate effect of reducing
    net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2009 by $0.49.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $584.7 million, or 13.6%, to $4.880 billion in Fiscal
    2008 from $4.295 billion in Fiscal 2007. The increase was
    driven by a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and
    favorable foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of
    acquisitions, net revenues increased by $371.2 million, or
    8.6%. On a reported basis, Wholesale revenues increased by
    $442.2 million primarily as a result of incremental
    revenues from the newly acquired Impact 21 and Small
    Leathergoods businesses, the inclusion of revenues from the
    initial shipments of the

American Living

product line to
    JCPenney and increased sales in our global menswear and
    womenswear product lines, primarily driven by strong performance
    in Europe. The increase in net revenues also was driven by an
    increase of $169.4 million in our Retail segment revenues
    as a result of an increase in comparable global retail store
    sales, continued global store expansion and growth in
    RalphLauren.com sales. The increase in net revenues was
    partially offset by a decrease of $26.9 million in
    licensing revenue, primarily due to a decrease in



international licensing royalties as a result of the loss of
    licensing revenues from Impact 21, which is now consolidated as
    part of the Wholesale segment. Also contributing to the decrease
    in licensing revenue was a net decrease in domestic licensing
    royalties, primarily due to the absence of approximately
    $8 million of minimum royalty and design-service fees
    received in connection with the termination of a licensing
    arrangement in the prior fiscal year.

Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below:

Wholesale net revenues

— The net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

the inclusion of $254 million of revenues from the newly
    acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, net of
    intercompany eliminations;

•

an approximate $47 million increase in our European
    businesses on a constant currency basis driven by increased
    sales in our menswear and womenswear product lines;

•

an aggregate $81 million net increase in our
    U.S. businesses. The net increase was primarily due to the
    initial shipments of the

American Living

product line to
    JCPenney; an increase in our menswear shipments; a net increase
    in womenswear, primarily driven by

Chaps

, partially
    offset by increased promotional activity; and an increase in
    footwear attributable to increased door penetration. Offsetting
    these increases were a decline in our childrenswear product
    lines due to weaker sales at department stores and increased
    promotional activity; and a planned reduction in our off-price
    channel denim business; and

•

a $60 million increase in revenues due to a favorable
    foreign currency effect, primarily related to the continued
    strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar
    in Fiscal 2008.

Retail net revenues

— The increase primarily
    reflects:

•

a $87 million aggregate net increase in comparable
    full-price and factory store sales on a global basis, including
    a net aggregate favorable $22 million foreign currency
    effect. This net increase was driven by increases in comparable
    store sales as provided below:

•

a $52 million aggregate net increase in sales from

    within the past fiscal year. There was a net increase in average
    global store count of 9 stores, to a total of 313 stores,
    compared to the prior fiscal year. The net increase in store
    count was primarily due to several new domestic and
    international full-price and factory store openings; and

•

a $30 million, or 26.4%, increase in sales at
    RalphLauren.com.

Licensing revenue

— The net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

a $26 million net decrease in international licensing
    royalties, primarily due to the loss of licensing revenues from
    Impact 21, which is now consolidated as part of the Wholesale
    segment; and

•

a $1 million net decrease in domestic licensing royalties,
    primarily due to the absence of approximately $8 million of
    minimum royalty and design-service fees received in connection
    with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior
    fiscal year. The net decrease was partially offset by an
    increase in eyewear-related royalties as a result of the
    licensing agreement entered into with Luxottica Group, S.p.A.
    and affiliates, which took effect on January 1, 2007.

Gross Profit.

Cost of goods sold includes the
    expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale,
    including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well
    as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory
    realizability. The costs of selling merchandise, including those
    associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as
    picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in
    SG&A expenses.

Gross profit increased by $301.9 million, or 12.9%, to
    $2.638 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $2.336 billion in
    Fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
    decreased by 30 basis points to 54.1% in Fiscal 2008 from
    54.4% in Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the dilutive effect of
    our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of acquisitions,
    gross profit increased by $208.6 million, or 8.9%, and
    gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased
    10 basis points compared to Fiscal 2007. The increase in
    gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was due to improved
    performance in our European wholesale operations which generally
    carry higher margins, offset in part by increased domestic
    promotional activity as well as a slight change in the overall
    relative sales mix between the Wholesale segment and the higher
    margin Retail and Licensing segments.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a
    variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix
    among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products
    sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs.
    These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses primarily include
    compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts,
    information technology, facilities, legal and other costs
    associated with finance and administration. SG&A expenses
    increased by $269.1 million, or 16.2%, to
    $1.932 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $1.663 billion in
    Fiscal 2007. The increase included approximately
    $36 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects,
    primarily related to the continued strengthening of the Euro in
    comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2008. SG&A
    expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to 39.6% in
    Fiscal 2008 from 38.7% in Fiscal 2007. The
    net 90 basis point increase was primarily associated
    with operating expenses at the Company’s newly acquired
    businesses and certain

start-up

costs related to new business launches. The $269.1 million
    increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs of approximately
    $91 million for our newly acquired Impact 21 and Small
    Leathergoods businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to
    transition service arrangements;

•

higher stock-based compensation expense of approximately
    $27 million primarily due to an increase in the
    Company’s share price as of the date of its annual equity
    award grant in the second quarter of Fiscal 2008 compared to the
    share price as of the comparable grant date in Fiscal 2007;

•

higher compensation-related expenses (excluding stock-based
    compensation) of approximately $56 million, principally
    relating to increased selling costs associated with higher
    retail and wholesale sales and our ongoing product line
    expansion, including

American Living

and a dedicated
    dress business across multiple brands, as well as
    severance-related costs;



•

an approximate $39 million increase in rent and utility
    costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses,
    including rent expense related to certain retail stores
    scheduled to open in Fiscal 2009; and

•

an approximate $25 million increase in depreciation expense
    primarily associated with global retail store expansion,
    construction and renovation of department store
    shop-within-shops and investments in our facilities and
    technological infrastructure.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $31.6 million, to $47.2 million in Fiscal
    2008 from $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The net increase
    was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets
    acquired in connection with the Company’s recent
    acquisitions. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the
    acquisitions.

Impairments of Assets.

A non-cash impairment
    charge of $5.0 million was recognized in Fiscal 2008 to
    reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets in the
    Company’s Retail segment to their estimated fair value. The
    impairment was primarily attributable to lower-than-expected
    operating cash flow performance in certain stores. No impairment
    charges were recognized in Fiscal 2007. See Note 11 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $4.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2007 primarily
    associated with the Club Monaco retail business. No significant
    restructuring charges were recognized in Fiscal 2008. See
    Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    slightly by $0.8 million, or 0.1%, to $653.4 million
    in Fiscal 2008 from $652.6 million in Fiscal 2007.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased
    180 basis points, to 13.4% in Fiscal 2008 from 15.2% in
    Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the effect of purchase accounting
    relating to the acquisitions. Excluding the effect of
    acquisitions, operating income increased by $43.0 million,
    or 6.6%, while operating income as a percentage of net revenues
    decreased 30 basis points in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in
    operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily
    reflected the increase in SG&A expenses due to business
    expansion, partially offset by an increase in gross profit
    margin as previously discussed.

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $87.6 million, including the favorable effects from the
    Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions.
    Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, Wholesale operating
    income increased by $61.4 million primarily as a result of
    increased net sales, including shipments of

American
    Living

, and improved gross margin primarily in our European
    wholesale operations, offset in part by increased domestic
    promotional activity in certain product categories. The increase
    was partially offset by higher net SG&A expenses in
    support of our new product lines.

Retail operating income

decreased by $20.0 million,
    including the unfavorable effects from purchase accounting
    related to the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition. Excluding
    the effects of the acquisition, Retail operating income
    decreased by $9.0 million primarily as a result of
    increased markdown activity, a non-cash



impairment charge of $5.0 million, and an increase in
    occupancy and other operating costs principally related to
    worldwide store expansion, as we continue to develop and invest
    in our existing retail concepts and formats. The decrease also
    reflected an increase in selling-related salaries and associated
    costs, as well as increased fulfillment costs associated with
    higher sales at RalphLauren.com.

Licensing operating income

decreased by
    $44.9 million, including the unfavorable effects from the
    Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions.
    Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, Licensing operating
    income increased by $12.5 million primarily due to an
    increase in eyewear-related royalties. This increase was
    partially offset by the absence of approximately $8 million
    of minimum royalty and design-service fees received in
    connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in
    the prior fiscal year.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $33.6 million, primarily as a result of increases in
    brand-related marketing costs, including costs associated with
    various events related to the Company’s
    40th anniversary, and compensation-related and facilities
    costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The
    increase in compensation-related costs includes higher
    stock-based compensation expense and severance-related costs, as
    previously discussed under

SG&A expenses

.

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

were
    comprised of a reversal of an excess reserve in the amount of
    $4.1 million in Fiscal 2008 related to the Credit Card
    Matter (as discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements). Unallocated legal and
    restructuring charges were $7.6 million in Fiscal 2007 and
    were principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring
    Plan charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 12 to
    the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and
    costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card Matter.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to a loss of
    $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007. Foreign currency losses
    increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a
    $2.0 million write-off of foreign currency option
    contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign currency
    exposures associated with the Japanese Business Acquisitions,
    most of which expired unexercised as of March 29, 2008,
    hedge activity associated with the return of capital from a
    foreign subsidiary and intercompany royalty activity, as well as
    the timing of the settlement of third party and intercompany
    receivables and payables (that were not of a long-term
    investment nature). Foreign currency gains and losses are
    unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the
    U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including
    amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our
    capital lease obligations. Interest expense increased by
    $4.1 million to $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from
    $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase is primarily due
    to additional borrowings undertaken during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2008 in connection with the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions (see

“Financial Condition and
    Liquidity — Debt and Covenant Compliance”

for
    further discussion), as well as the higher principal amount of
    our outstanding Euro denominated debt. This increase was
    partially offset by the absence of overlapping interest on debt
    during the period between the issuance of approximately
    €300 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due
    October 4, 2013 (the “Euro Debt”) and the
    repayment of approximate €227 million principal amount
    of 6.125% notes outstanding that were due on
    November 22, 2006, from an original issuance of
    €275 million in 1999 (the “1999 Euro Debt”),
    in the prior fiscal year.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, decreased by $1.4 million, to
    $24.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from $26.1 million in
    Fiscal 2007. This decrease was principally driven by lower
    average interest rates, lower balances on our invested excess
    cash and higher transaction-related costs.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

The equity in loss of equity-method
    investees of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 related to certain

start-up

costs associated with the recently formed joint venture, RL
    Watch Company, which the Company accounts for under the equity
    method of accounting. The equity in income of equity-method
    investees of $3.0 million in Fiscal 2007 related to Impact
    21, which was previously accounted for as an equity-method
    investment. The results of operations for Impact 21 have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, no equity income
    related to Impact 21 was recorded in Fiscal 2008. See
    Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion of the Company’s Impact
    21 Acquisition.



Minority Interest Expense.

Minority interest
    expense decreased by $13.2 million, to $2.1 million in
    Fiscal 2008 from $15.3 million in Fiscal 2007. The decrease
    is related to the Company’s acquisition of the remaining
    50% interests in RL Media and PRL Japan. This decrease was
    partially offset by an increase related to the allocation of
    Impact 21’s net income to the holders of the approximate
    80% interest not owned by the Company prior to the closing date
    of the related tender offer and to the holders of the remaining
    approximate 3% interest not owned by the Company as of the end
    of Fiscal 2008. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the
    Company’s acquisitions.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by
    $20.1 million, or 8.3%, to $222.3 million in Fiscal
    2008 from $242.4 million in Fiscal 2007. This decrease was
    primarily due to a decrease in our reported effective tax rate
    of 310 basis points, to 34.6% in Fiscal 2008 from 37.7% in
    Fiscal 2007, and a decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2008
    compared to Fiscal 2007. The lower effective tax rate is
    primarily due to tax reserve reductions associated with an audit
    settlement and the expiration of a statute of limitations, lower
    state income taxes as well as a change in the geographic mix of
    earnings, partially offset by certain higher, non-deductible
    expenses under § 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the
    effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign
    jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective
    tax rate will change from year to year based on non-recurring
    factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of
    earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted
    tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and
    settlements, and the interaction of various global tax
    strategies. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the
    Company’s adoption of FIN 48 as of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2008.

Net Income.

Net income increased by
    $18.9 million, or 4.7%, to $419.8 million in Fiscal
    2008 from $400.9 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in
    net income principally related to the $20.1 million
    decrease in provision for income taxes discussed above and the
    $0.8 million increase in operating income. The increase was
    partially offset by reductions in operating income primarily
    related to the dilutive effect of purchase accounting, an
    increase in domestic promotional activity and higher SG&A
    expenses principally associated with our recent acquisitions.
    The net dilutive effect related to the Company’s recent
    acquisitions included approximately $53 million of non-cash
    amortization of intangible assets and inventory. See Note 5
    to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements
    for further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions.

Net Income Per Diluted Share.

Net income per
    diluted share increased by $0.26, or 7.0%, to $3.99 per share in
    Fiscal 2008 from $3.73 per share in Fiscal 2007. The increase in
    diluted per share results was primarily due to the higher level
    of net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares
    outstanding for Fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year.

“Net cash and short-term investments” is defined as
    total cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term investments
    less total debt. “Net debt” is defined as total debt
    less total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.



The increase to the Company’s net cash and short-term
    investments position as of March 28, 2009 as compared to a
    net debt position as of March 29, 2008 was primarily due to
    growth in operating cash flows, partially offset by the
    Company’s use of cash to support its treasury stock
    repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisition spending. In
    Fiscal 2009, the Company used $169.8 million to repurchase
    2.5 million shares of Class A common stock and spent
    $185.0 million for capital expenditures. The Company also
    used approximately $26.0 million to fund its recent
    Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition. In addition, the
    Company repaid its current maturities of debt using available
    cash on-hand in May 2008.

The increase in the Company’s short-term investments was
    primarily due to the investment of excess cash in time deposits
    with maturities greater than 90 days.

The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to
    the Company’s net income in Fiscal 2009, offset in part by
    an increase in treasury stock as a result of the Company’s
    common stock repurchase program.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to
    $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008. This net increase in
    operating cash flow was primarily driven by:

•

an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization,
    non-cash asset impairment charges, stock-based compensation and
    other non-cash expenses; and

•

an approximate $84 million decrease in cash tax payments.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

an increase in inventory primarily due to the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, offset in part by the
    effects of ongoing inventory management across most businesses.

Other than the items described above, the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating
    fluctuations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $458.0 million in
    Fiscal 2009, as compared to $505.0 million in Fiscal 2008.
    The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

a decrease in net cash used to fund the Company’s
    acquisitions. In Fiscal 2009, the Company used
    $46.3 million primarily to fund the Japanese Childrenswear
    and Golf Acquisition and to complete the minority squeeze-out
    related to the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a comparative
    basis, in Fiscal 2008, the Company used $188.7 million
    principally to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions, net of
    cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition;

•

a decrease in cash used in connection with capital expenditures.
    In Fiscal 2009, the Company spent $185.0 million for
    capital expenditures, as compared to $217.1 million in
    Fiscal 2008. The Company’s capital expenditures were
    primarily associated with global retail store expansion,
    construction and



renovation of department store shop-within-shops and investments
    in its facilities and technological infrastructure; and

•

a change in restricted cash deposits. In Fiscal 2009, net
    restricted cash of $26.9 million was released primarily in
    connection with the partial settlement of certain international
    tax matters. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2008 included net
    restricted cash deposits of $15.1 million.

The above decreases were partially offset by:

•

an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds
    from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2009, the
    Company used $623.1 million to purchase investments, less
    $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008,
    $96.8 million was used to purchase investments, less
    $12.7 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net
    cash used in financing activities was $352.1 million in
    Fiscal 2009, as compared to $260.5 million in Fiscal 2008.
    The increase in net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

the repayment of ¥20.5 billion ($196.8 million as
    of the repayment date) of borrowings under a one-year term loan
    agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the
    Company’s existing credit facility (the “Term
    Loan”) in Fiscal 2009 related to the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2008 included the
    receipt of proceeds from the Term Loan of $168.9 million as
    of the borrowing date; and

•

a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation
    arrangements of $22.3 million in Fiscal 2009 as compared to
    the prior fiscal year.

The above increases were partially offset by:

•

a decrease in repurchases of the Company’s Class A
    common stock pursuant to the Company’s common stock
    repurchase program. Approximately 2.5 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $169.8 million
    (including approximately 0.4 million shares at a cost of
    $24.0 million that was traded prior to the end of Fiscal
    2008 for which settlement occurred in April 2008) were
    repurchased in Fiscal 2009, as compared to approximately
    6.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $475.4 million in Fiscal 2008.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities decreased to
    $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to
    $796.1 million in Fiscal 2007. This $100.7 million net
    decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by:

•

the absence of the approximately $180 million, net of
    certain tax withholdings, received under an eyewear licensing
    agreement in the prior fiscal year; and

•

an increase in other receivables primarily attributable to the
    timing of estimated tax payments.



The above decreases were partially offset by:

•

an increase in net income before non-cash depreciation,
    amortization and stock-based compensation expenses;

•

improved accounts receivable cash collections in the
    Company’s Wholesale segment; and

•

the effects of ongoing inventory management, which resulted in
    lower average balance and increased inventory turns across
    certain businesses.

Other than the items described above, the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating
    fluctuations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $505.0 million in
    Fiscal 2008, as compared to $434.6 million in Fiscal 2007.
    The net increase in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

an increase in net cash used to fund the Company’s
    acquisitions. In Fiscal 2008, the Company used
    $188.7 million principally to fund the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods
    Business Acquisition; whereas in Fiscal 2007,
    $176.1 million was used primarily to fund the RL Media
    Minority Interest Acquisition;

•

an increase in cash used in connection with capital
    expenditures. In Fiscal 2008, the Company spent
    $217.1 million for capital expenditures, as compared to
    $184.0 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in capital
    expenditures is primarily associated with global retail store
    expansion, construction and renovation of department store
    shop-within-shops and investments in our facilities and
    technological infrastructure, including showrooms related to our
    new businesses;

•

an increase related to purchases of investments of
    $96.8 million, less proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments of $12.7 million, in Fiscal 2008; and

•

a partially offsetting decrease in restricted cash deposits.
    During Fiscal 2008, $15.1 million of cash was restricted as
    compared to $74.5 million during Fiscal 2007. Restricted
    cash was placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral to
    secure guarantees of a corresponding amount made by the banks to
    certain international tax authorities on behalf of the Company.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net
    cash used in financing activities was $260.5 million in
    Fiscal 2008, as compared to $95.2 million in Fiscal 2007.
    The increase in net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

increased repurchases of the Company’s Class A common
    stock pursuant to the Company’s common stock repurchase
    program. Approximately 6.0 million shares of Class A
    common stock at a cost of $475.4 million were repurchased
    in Fiscal 2008, as compared to approximately 3.5 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $231.3 million in Fiscal 2007; and

•

a partially offsetting increase in proceeds from issuance of
    debt. Fiscal 2008 included the receipt of proceeds from
    borrowings of ¥20.5 billion ($168.9 million as of
    the borrowing date) under a one-year term loan agreement in
    connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a
    comparative basis, Fiscal 2007 included the receipt of proceeds
    from the issuance of €300 million principal amount
    ($380.0 million) of Euro Debt, offset in part by the
    repayment of approximately €227 million principal
    amount ($291.6 million) of 1999 Euro Debt.

Liquidity

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are the cash
    flow generated from its operations, $450 million of
    availability under its credit facility, available cash and cash
    equivalents, investments and other available financing options.
    These sources of liquidity are needed to fund the Company’s
    ongoing cash requirements, including working capital
    requirements, global retail store expansion, construction and
    renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in technological
    infrastructure, acquisitions, joint ventures, dividends, debt
    repayment, stock



repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax
    positions) and other corporate activities. Notwithstanding the
    current global economic crisis, management believes that the
    Company’s existing sources of cash will be sufficient to
    support its operating, capital and debt service requirements for
    the foreseeable future, including the finalization of
    acquisitions and plans for business expansion.

As discussed below under the section entitled

“Debt and
    Covenant Compliance,”

the Company had no revolving
    credit borrowings outstanding under its credit facility as of
    March 28, 2009. However, as discussed further below, the
    Company may elect to draw on its credit facility or other
    potential sources of financing for, among other things, a
    material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency
    (including uncertain tax positions) or a material adverse
    business development, as well as for other general corporate
    business purposes. In recognition of the current global economic
    crisis, the Company believes its credit facility is adequately
    diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial
    institution. In particular, as of March 28, 2009, there
    were 13 financial institutions participating in the credit
    facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum
    commitment percentage in excess of approximately 20%. Although
    there can be no assurances, management believes that the
    participating institutions will be able to fulfill their
    obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of
    the credit facility in the event of the Company’s election
    to draw funds in the foreseeable future.

In May 2007, the Company completed the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions. These transactions were funded with available cash
    on-hand and the ¥20.5 billion Term Loan. The Company
    repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008
    using $196.8 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand
    acquired as part of the acquisition.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

In May 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an
    expansion of the Company’s existing common stock repurchase
    program that allows the Company to repurchase up to an
    additional $250 million of Class A common stock.
    Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject
    to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2009,
    1.8 million shares of Class A common stock were
    repurchased by the Company at a cost of $126.2 million
    under its repurchase program. Also, during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of
    Fiscal 2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. The
    remaining availability under the common stock repurchase program
    was approximately $266 million as of March 28, 2009.

In addition, in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $19.6 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as
    amended and restated.

In Fiscal 2008, share repurchases amounted to 6.1 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $476.4 million, including $24.0 million
    (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of
    the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. In
    addition, in Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as
    amended and restated.

In Fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 3.5 million shares
    of Class A common stock at a cost of $231.3 million.

Dividends

The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per
    outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008
    and Fiscal 2007. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was
    $19.9 million in Fiscal 2009, $20.5 million in Fiscal
    2008 and $20.9 million in Fiscal 2007.

The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly
    dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision
    to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
    discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will
    depend on, among other things, the Company’s results of
    operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other
    factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.



Debt
    and Covenant Compliance

Euro
    Debt

The Company has outstanding approximately €300 million
    principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013.
    The Company has the option to redeem all of the Euro Debt at any
    time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a
    premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the
    Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest in the event
    of certain developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial
    redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance.
    In the event of a change of control of the Company, each holder
    of the Euro Debt has the option to require the Company to redeem
    the Euro Debt at its principal amount plus accrued interest. The
    indenture governing the Euro Debt (the “Indenture”)
    contains certain limited covenants that restrict the
    Company’s ability, subject to specified exceptions, to
    incur liens or enter into a sale and leaseback transaction for
    any principal property. The Indenture does not contain any
    financial covenants.

As of March 28, 2009, the carrying value of the Euro Debt
    was $406.4 million, compared to $472.8 million as of
    March 29, 2008. The Company may from time to time
    repurchase all or a portion of its Euro Debt in the open market,
    via tender offer or otherwise.

Revolving
    Credit Facility and Term Loan

The Company has a credit facility that provides for a
    $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through
    November 2011 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
    Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of March 28, 2009, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility, and the Company was
    contingently liable for $13.7 million of outstanding
    letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase
    commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its
    borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the
    agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
    facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory
    reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the
    Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility
    (“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. The Credit Facility also requires the Company to
    maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated
    EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”) of no greater than 3.75
    as of the date of measurement for four consecutive quarters.
    Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt
    outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent expense for the last
    twelve months. EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net
    income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest
    expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and
    (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of March 28, 2009,
    no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the
    Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s Credit
    Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the



financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Credit
    Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if
    Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, and related entities controlled by
    Mr. Lauren fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage
    of the voting power of the Company’s common stock.

The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22,
    2007 to provide for the addition of the ¥20.5 billion
    Term Loan. This loan was made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a wholly
    owned subsidiary of the Company, and was guaranteed by the
    Company, as well as the other subsidiaries of the Company which
    currently guarantee the Credit Facility. The proceeds of the
    Term Loan were used to finance the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions. Borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at a
    fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the borrowing by its
    maturity date on May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of
    Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as part of the
    acquisition. See

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

The following table summarizes certain of the Company’s
    aggregate contractual obligations as of March 28, 2009, and
    the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are
    expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flow
    in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm
    commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal
    course of business and, if necessary, availability under its
    $450 million credit facility or other potential sources of
    financing.

represents the principal amount due at maturity
    of the Company’s outstanding Euro Debt on a
    U.S. dollar-equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any
    fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments;

•

Lease obligations

represent the minimum lease rental
    payments under noncancelable leases for the Company’s real
    estate and operating equipment in various locations around the
    world. Approximately 60% of these lease obligations relates to
    the Company’s retail operations. Information has been
    presented separately for operating and capital leases. In
    addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to
    pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased
    real estate properties; and

•

Inventory purchase commitments

represent the
    Company’s legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or
    minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices.

Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the
    non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
    $154.8 million recognized pursuant to FIN 48. This
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded
    because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the
    period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.

The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts
    included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheet as of March 28, 2009 as these items will be paid
    within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have
    no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue)
    or the cash outflows associated with them are



uncertain or do not represent a “purchase obligation”
    as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other
    miscellaneous items).

The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would
    require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See
    Note 16 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for a description of the Company’s contingent
    commitments not included in the above table.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company’s off-balance sheet firm commitments, which
    include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding
    commitments to investees, amounted to $19.9 million as of
    March 28, 2009. In addition, as discussed in

“Recent Developments,”

the Company has entered
    into an agreement to assume direct control of its Polo-branded
    licensed apparel business in Southeast Asia effective
    January 1, 2010 in exchange for a cash payment of
    $20.0 million and certain other consideration. The Company
    does not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements,
    transactions, obligations or other relationships with
    unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a
    material current or future effect on its financial condition or
    results of operations.

MARKET
    RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company is exposed to a variety of risks, including changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain
    anticipated cash flows from its international operations and
    possible declines in the fair value of reported net assets of
    certain of its foreign operations, as well as changes in the
    fair value of its fixed-rate debt relating to changes in
    interest rates. Consequently, in the normal course of business
    the Company employs established policies and procedures,
    including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage
    such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative
    transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is
    exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts
    will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only
    entering into contracts with carefully selected financial
    institutions based upon their credit ratings and other financial
    factors. The Company’s established policies and procedures
    for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include
    reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.
    As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not
    believe it is exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty
    risk with respect to its derivative contracts as of
    March 28, 2009. However, the Company does have
    approximately 48% of its derivative instruments in asset
    positions placed with one creditworthy financial institution.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

The Company manages its exposure to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange
    contracts. Refer to Note 15 to the audited consolidated
    financial statements for a summarization of the notional amounts
    and fair values of the Company’s foreign currency exchange
    contracts outstanding as of March 28, 2009.

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

From time to time, the Company may enter into forward foreign
    currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from
    exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany
    royalty payments made by certain of its international
    operations, intercompany contributions made to fund certain
    marketing efforts of its international operations, interest
    payments made in connection with outstanding debt, other foreign
    currency-denominated operational obligations including payroll,
    rent, insurance and benefit payments, and foreign
    currency-denominated revenues. As part of our overall strategy
    to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of
    the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British
    Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign
    currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve-month to
    two-year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency
    exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three
    months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout
    the hedging period.



The Company’s foreign exchange risk management activities
    are governed by policies and procedures approved by its Audit
    Committee and Board of Directors. Our policies and procedures
    provide a framework that allows for the management of currency
    exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within
    established Company guidelines. Our policies includes guidelines
    for the organizational structure of our risk management function
    and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management
    activities, including but not limited to authorization levels,
    transactional limits, and credit quality controls, as well as
    various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor
    foreign exchange risk using different techniques including a
    periodic review of market value and sensitivity analyses.

The Company records its foreign currency exchange contracts at
    fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency
    exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at hedge
    inception are accounted for in accordance with
    FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and subsequent
    amendments (collectively, “FAS 133”). As such, to
    the extent these hedges are effective, the related gains
    (losses) are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These
    deferred gains (losses) are then recognized in our consolidated
    statements of operations as follows:

•

Forecasted Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as
    part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of
    goods sold when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency gains
    (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Operational Obligations

— Recognized primarily
    within SG&A expenses in the period in which the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings.

•

Interest Payments on Euro Debt

— Recognized
    within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which
    the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency
    exchange remeasurement.

The Company recognized net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in earnings of approximately $6 million for
    Fiscal 2009 and $8 million for Fiscal 2008, and a net gain
    of approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2007.

Sensitivity

The Company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the
    effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values
    of the Company’s derivative financial instruments. To
    perform the sensitivity analysis, the Company assesses the risk
    of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like
    movement by all foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio
    against the U.S. dollar. Based on all foreign currency
    exchange contracts outstanding as of March 28, 2009, a 10%
    devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of
    foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as
    of March 28, 2009 would result in approximately
    $2 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10%
    appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in
    approximately $2 million of net unrealized gains. As the
    Company’s outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts
    are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted
    transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10%
    devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes
    in the underlying hedged items.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company designated the entire principal amount of its
    outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries. As required by
    FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative
    instrument or a non-derivative financial instrument (such as
    debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a
    foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a
    translation adjustment under FAS No. 52, “Foreign
    Currency Translation,” to the extent it is effective as a
    hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the Euro Debt
    resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and
    continue to be, reported in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company
    recorded within other comprehensive



income the translation effects of the Euro Debt to
    U.S. dollars, resulting in a gain of $66.6 million for
    Fiscal 2009, and losses of $73.8 million for Fiscal 2008
    and $30.8 million for Fiscal 2007.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered
    into three forward-starting interest rate swap contracts in
    anticipation of the Company’s proposed refinancing of the
    1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in October 2006. These
    contracts were designated as cash flow hedges of a forecasted
    transaction to issue new debt in connection with the planned
    refinancing. The interest rate swaps hedged a total of
    €200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest
    rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of
    the swaps, the Company paid a weighted-average fixed rate of
    interest of 4.1% and received variable interest based on
    six-month EURIBOR. The Company terminated the swaps on
    September 28, 2006, which was the date the interest rate
    for the Euro Debt was determined. As a result, the Company made
    a payment of approximately €3.5 million
    ($4.4 million) in settlement of the swaps. An amount of
    $0.2 million was recognized as a loss in Fiscal 2007 due to
    the partial ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result
    of the forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006
    instead of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999
    Euro Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million was deferred
    as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity and is being recognized in earnings as an adjustment to
    interest expense over the seven-year term of the Euro Debt.

No other interest rate-related agreements have been entered into
    since Fiscal 2007.

Sensitivity

As of March 28, 2009, the Company had no variable-rate debt
    outstanding. As such, the Company’s exposure to changes in
    interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate Euro Debt. As
    of March 28, 2009, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was
    $406.4 million and the fair value was $320.0 million.
    A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of
    interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the
    fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $3 million.
    Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain
    simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro currency
    exchange rates and an immediate

across-the-board

increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no
    other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.

The Term Loan of ¥20.5 billion made to Polo JP Acqui,
    B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was repaid by
    the Company by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using
    $196.8 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as
    part of the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

Investment
    Risk Management

As of March 28, 2009, the Company had cash and cash
    equivalents on-hand of $481.2 million, primarily invested
    in money market funds and time deposits with maturities of less
    than 90 days. The Company’s other significant
    investments included $338.7 million of short-term
    investments, primarily in time deposits with maturities greater
    than 90 days; $71.7 million of restricted cash placed
    in escrow with certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees
    in connection with certain international tax matters;
    $27.1 million of deposits with maturities greater than one
    year; and $2.3 million of auction rate securities issued
    through a municipality.

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss
    positions for

other-than-temporary

impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a
    variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and
    uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and
    distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors
    considered by the Company include (i) the length of time
    and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost,
    (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and
    near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time
    to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market
    forecasts and (v) the Company’s intent and ability to
    retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
    for recovery of market value. The Company limits its exposure by
    primarily investing in highly rated investments issued by
    municipalities.



CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 60,
    “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
    Accounting Policies” (“FRR 60”), suggests
    companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those
    accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers
    an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations and
    requires significant judgment and estimation on the part of
    management in its application. The Company’s estimates are
    often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions
    that we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently
    uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other
    professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts
    and circumstances, could develop and support a range of
    alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the
    following list represents its critical accounting policies as
    contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the
    Company’s significant accounting policies, see Notes 3
    and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements.

Sales
    Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts

A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and
    net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that
    portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In
    particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including

e-commerce

sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns.

In determining estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes
    historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market
    conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to
    determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant
    judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation,
    including an analysis of specific risks on a

customer-by-customer

basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging
    analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has
    historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this
    information, management provides a reserve for the estimated
    amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management
    believes that it has adequately provided for those risks as part
    of its bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact
    on its major customers’ business operations could have a
    corresponding material adverse effect on the Company’s net
    sales, cash flows

and/or

financial condition.

See “Accounts Receivable” in Note 3 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an
    analysis of the activity in the Company’s sales reserves
    and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal
    years presented.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning product and fashion product.
    Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on
    an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company’s
    individual product lines, the impact of market trends and
    economic conditions, and the value of current orders in-house
    relating to the future sales of inventory. Estimates may differ
    from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products
    in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market
    conditions. The Company’s historical estimates of these
    costs and its provisions have not differed materially from
    actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.



Purchase
    Accounting

The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the
    purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of
    acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on
    their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the
    purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets
    acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires
    management’s judgment and often involves the use of
    significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions
    with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount
    rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items.

In addition, in connection with its business acquisitions, the
    Company evaluates the terms of any pre-existing relationships to
    determine if a settlement of the pre-existing relationship
    exists. These pre-existing relationships primarily relate to
    licensing agreements. In accordance with the Emerging Issues
    Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 04-1,

“Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the
    Parties to a Business Combination,” the Company is required
    to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these
    transactions between the value of the business acquired and the
    value of the settlement of any pre-existing relationships in
    proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the
    terms of the pre-existing relationships were determined to not
    be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be
    recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is
    required to determine the respective fair values of the business
    acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre-existing
    relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent
    valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FAS No. 157, “Fair
    Value Measurements” (“FAS 157” or the
    “Standard”). FAS 157 defines “fair
    value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date within an
    identified principal or most advantageous market, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP
    and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements
    through a three-level valuation hierarchy. The Company adopted
    the provisions of FAS 157 for all of its financial assets
    and liabilities within the Standard’s scope as of the
    beginning of Fiscal 2009 (March 30, 2008). The Company uses
    judgment in the determination of the applicable level within the
    hierarchy of a particular asset or liability when evaluating the
    inputs used in valuation as of the measurement date, notably the
    extent to which the inputs are market-based (observable) or
    internally derived (unobservable). See Notes 4 and 15 to
    the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of the effect of this accounting change on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (“FAS 142”). Under FAS 142, goodwill,
    including any goodwill included in the carrying value of
    investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting,
    and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment
    at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair
    values to their carrying values. Finite-lived intangible assets
    are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and,
    along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment
    periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable in accordance with FAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“FAS 144”).

In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is
    determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by
    comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book
    value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
    of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and
    performance of the second step of the impairment test is
    unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
    its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test
    is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
    The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the
    implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with
    the carrying amount



of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
    goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
    the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
    business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting
    unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that
    unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the
    reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
    the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the
    reporting unit.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first
    step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair
    value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit
    (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step
    of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and
    often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
    Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the
    fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
    impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such
    charge. To assist management in the process of determining
    goodwill impairment, the Company reviews and considers
    appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair
    value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows,
    market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use
    significant estimates and assumptions, including projected
    future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting
    the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates
    and determination of appropriate market comparables.

The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
    asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition,
    in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability,
    the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected
    to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition in
    accordance with FAS 144. To the extent that estimated
    future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are
    less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized
    equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset
    and its fair value.

There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with
    the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill or other
    intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented.

Impairment
    of Other Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. In
    evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company
    uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the
    extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
    attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between
    the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to
    be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of
    disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair
    value less costs to sell.

In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various
    factors into account, including changes in merchandising
    strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the
    effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and
    the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and
    increased local advertising. Since the determination of future
    cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be
    future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not
    meet expectations.

During Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, the Company recorded
    non-cash impairment charges of $55.4 million and
    $5.0 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying
    value of certain long-lived assets primarily in its Retail
    segment to their estimated fair value. No impairment charges
    were recorded in Fiscal 2007. See Note 11 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes” (“FAS 109”). Under this method,
    income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current
    taxes



payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based
    on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include
    the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax reporting.
    Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net
    operating loss, capital loss and general business credit
    carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences
    between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
    financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under
    enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the
    financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period
    of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when
    management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some
    portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

Effective April 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48.
    Upon the adoption of the provisions of FIN 48, the Company
    changed its policy related to the accounting for income tax
    uncertainties. If the Company considers that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
    recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit
    by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and
    the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To
    the extent that the Company’s estimates change or the final
    tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts
    recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision
    in the period in which such determinations are made. If the
    initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax
    benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and
    subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are
    changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise
    the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the
    position to more-likely-than-not, (ii) the statute of
    limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an
    audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the
    appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as
    current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the
    next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded
    within the provision for income taxes in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the
    consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the
    Company’s income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48.

Contingencies

The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in
    the ordinary course of conducting its business, including
    certain litigations, alleged information system security breach
    matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters,
    various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property
    matters and disputes. In accordance with FAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies”
    (“FAS 5”), the Company records a liability for
    such contingencies to the extent that it concludes their
    occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In
    addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable
    settlement of a contingency could exceed the established
    liability, the Company discloses the estimated impact on its
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
    Management considers many factors in making these assessments.
    As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently
    unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex
    judgments about future events including, but not limited to,
    court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and
    governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss
    contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements
    in accordance with FAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
    Payment” (“FAS 123R”), which requires all
    share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors to
    be expensed based on the grant date fair value of the awards
    over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated
    forfeitures.



Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which
    requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key
    assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key
    factors influencing the estimation process include the expected
    term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor,
    the expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate, among
    others. Generally, once stock option values are determined,
    current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed,
    even if the estimates used are different from the actuals.

Determining the fair value of stock-based compensation at the
    date of grant requires significant judgment by management,
    including estimates of the above Black-Scholes assumptions. In
    addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of
    stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual
    results differ significantly from these estimates, if management
    changes its assumptions for future stock-based award grants, or
    if there are changes in market conditions, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based RSUs to certain of its senior executives
    and non-employee directors. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to such senior executives and other key
    executives, and certain other employees of the Company. The fair
    values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair
    value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to
    reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities
    that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation
    expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the
    related service period when attainment of the performance goals
    is deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of
    management.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other
    procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
    issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time period specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
    Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that material
    information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
    that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of



is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal
    year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation,
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as
    of the fiscal year end covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

(b) Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in Securities Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and preparation of financial statements for external
    purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    for preparation of our financial statements; providing
    reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company’s assets are made in accordance with management
    authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our
    financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely
    basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
    over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute
    assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would
    be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was
    made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in
    future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on
    the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this
    evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s
    internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level as of the fiscal year end covered by
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as included elsewhere herein.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
    Reporting

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal
    2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Description
    of Business

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (“PRLC”) is a global
    leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium
    lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s and
    children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. PRLC’s long-standing reputation and
    distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    PRLC’s brand names include

Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph
    Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Collection, Black Label, Blue
    Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren
    Childrenswear, American Living, Chaps

and

Club
    Monaco

, among others. PRLC and its subsidiaries are
    collectively referred to herein as the “Company,”
    “we,” “us,” “our” and
    “ourselves,” unless the context indicates otherwise.

The Company classifies its businesses into three segments:
    Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. The Company’s wholesale
    sales are made principally to major department and specialty
    stores located throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Company
    also sells directly to consumers through full-price and factory
    retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South
    America and Asia, and through its retail internet sites located
    at www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com. In addition, the
    Company often licenses the right to unrelated third parties to
    use its various trademarks in connection with the manufacture
    and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and
    fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified
    periods.

2.

Basis of
    Presentation

Basis
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements present the financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company
    and all entities in which the Company has a controlling voting
    interest. The consolidated financial statements also include the
    accounts of any variable interest entities in which the Company
    is considered to be the primary beneficiary and such entities
    are required to be consolidated in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“US
    GAAP”).

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of the minority
    ownership interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation
    (“PRL Japan”) in May 2007, the Company consolidated
    PRL Japan, formerly a 50%-owned venture with Onward Kashiyama
    Co. Ltd and its affiliates (“Onward Kashiyama”) and
    The Seibu Department Stores, Ltd (“Seibu”), pursuant
    to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities” (“FIN 46R”). PRL Japan holds the
    master license to conduct the Company’s business in Japan.
    Additionally, prior to the acquisition of the minority ownership
    interests in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (“RL Media”) in
    March 2007, the Company consolidated RL Media, formerly a
    50%-owned venture with NBC-Lauren Media Holdings, Inc., a
    subsidiary wholly owned by the National Broadcasting Company,
    Inc. (“NBC”) and Value Vision Media, Inc. (“Value
    Vision”), pursuant to FIN 46R. RL Media conducts the
    Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com. See
    Note 5 for further discussion of the acquisitions referred
    to above, including their respective bases of consolidation in
    the fiscal years presented.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company utilizes a

52-53 week

fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As
    such, fiscal year 2009 ended on March 28, 2009 and
    reflected a 52-week period (“Fiscal 2009”); fiscal
    year 2008 ended on March 29, 2008 and reflected a 52-week
    period (“Fiscal 2008”); and fiscal year 2007 ended on
    March 31, 2007 and also reflected a 52-week period
    (“Fiscal 2007”).

The financial position and operating results of the
    Company’s consolidated PRL Japan and Impact 21 Co., Ltd.
    (“Impact 21”) entities located in Japan are reported
    on a one-month lag. Accordingly, the Company’s operating

F-6


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

results for Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008 include the operating
    results of PRL Japan and Impact 21 for the twelve-month periods
    ended February 28, 2009 and February 29, 2008,
    respectively, and the Company’s operating results for
    Fiscal 2007 include the operating results of PRL Japan for the
    twelve-month period ended February 28, 2007. The net effect
    of this reporting lag is not material to the consolidated
    financial statements.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements include reserves for customer
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks; the realizability of
    inventory; reserves for litigation and other contingencies;
    useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and
    intangible assets; accounting for income taxes and related
    uncertain tax positions; the valuation of stock-based
    compensation and related expected forfeiture rates; reserves for
    restructuring; and accounting for business combinations.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    years’ financial information in order to conform to the
    current year’s presentation.

3.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when
    there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has
    occurred, price has been fixed or is determinable, and
    collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenue within the Company’s Wholesale segment is
    recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of
    estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns, operational chargebacks and certain cooperative
    advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require
    pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade
    terms. Estimates for

end-of-season

markdown reserves are based on historical trends, seasonal
    results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions
    and retailer performance. Estimates for operational chargebacks
    are based on actual notifications of order fulfillment
    discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at
    the time of sale to consumers.

E-commerce

revenue from sales of products ordered through the
    Company’s retail internet sites at RalphLauren.com and
    Rugby.com is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the
    shipment by its customers. Such revenue also is reduced by an
    estimate of returns.

Gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability
    until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
    The Company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the
    likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is remote
    and the Company determines that it does not have a legal
    obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to the
    relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property.

Revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized when earned in
    accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements,
    generally based upon the higher of (a) contractually
    guaranteed minimum royalty levels or (b) actual sales and
    royalty data, or estimates thereof, received from the
    Company’s licensees.

The Company accounts for sales and other related taxes on a net
    basis, excluding such taxes from revenue.

Cost
    of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and
    produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in
    and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage
    and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with
    foreign currency exchange contracts related to the hedging of
    inventory purchases also are recognized within cost of goods
    sold when the inventory being hedged is sold. The costs of
    selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing
    the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing
    and order charges, are included in selling, general and
    administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

The costs associated with shipping goods to customers are
    reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling
    costs incurred approximated $95 million in Fiscal 2009,
    $108 million in Fiscal 2008 and $92 million in Fiscal
    2007. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are
    included in revenue.

Advertising
    Costs

In accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 93-7,

“Reporting on Advertising Costs,” advertising costs,
    including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when
    the advertisement is first exhibited. In accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,”
    costs of

out-of-store

advertising paid to wholesale customers under cooperative
    advertising programs are expensed as an advertising cost if both
    the identified advertising benefit is sufficiently separable
    from the purchase of the Company’s products by customers
    and the fair value of such benefit is measurable. Otherwise,
    such costs are reflected as a reduction of revenue. Costs of
    in-store advertising paid to wholesale customers under
    cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising
    costs, but are reflected as a reduction of revenues since the
    benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of
    the Company’s products by customers.

Advertising expense amounted to approximately $171 million
    for Fiscal 2009, $188 million for Fiscal 2008 and
    $181 million for Fiscal 2007. Deferred advertising costs,
    which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet
    been exhibited or services that have not yet been received, were
    approximately $6 million and $8 million at the end of
    Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and operating results of foreign
    operations are primarily consolidated using the local currency
    as the functional currency. Local currency assets and
    liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the
    balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are
    translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
    Resulting translation gains or losses are included in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    Gains and losses on translation of intercompany loans with
    foreign subsidiaries of a long-term investment nature also are
    included within this component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company also recognizes gains and losses on transactions
    that are denominated in a currency other than the respective
    entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses also include amounts realized on the settlement
    of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are either
    of a short-term investment nature or were previously of a
    long-term investment nature and deferred as a component of
    stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
    and losses are recognized in earnings and separately disclosed
    in the consolidated statements of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, consists
    of net income (loss) and other gains and losses affecting equity
    that, under US GAAP, are excluded from net income (loss). The
    components of other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company
    primarily consist of foreign currency translation gains and
    losses; unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

investments; unrealized gains and losses related to the
    accounting for defined benefit plans; and deferred gains and
    losses on hedging instruments, such as forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and changes in
    the fair value of the Company’s Euro-denominated debt
    designated as a hedge of changes in the fair value of the
    Company’s net investment in certain of its European
    subsidiaries.

Net
    Income Per Common Share

Net income per common share is determined in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”)
    No. 128, “Earnings per Share”
    (“FAS 128”). Under the provisions of
    FAS 128, basic net income per common share is computed by
    dividing the net income applicable to common shares after
    preferred dividend requirements, if any, by the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Weighted-average common shares include shares of the
    Company’s Class A and Class B common stock.
    Diluted net income per common share adjusts basic net income per
    common share for the effects of outstanding stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other
    potentially dilutive financial instruments, only in the periods
    in which such effect is dilutive under the treasury stock method.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to
    calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to
    those shares used in calculating diluted net income per common
    share as follows:

Options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
    greater than the average market price of the common stock during
    the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not
    included in the computation of diluted net income per common
    share. In addition, the Company has outstanding restricted stock
    units that are issuable only upon the achievement of certain
    service

and/or

performance goals. Such performance-based restricted stock units
    are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the
    extent the underlying performance conditions (a) are
    satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or
    (b) would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period
    were the end of the related contingency period and the result
    would be dilutive under the treasury stock method. As of the end
    of Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, there was an
    aggregate of approximately 3.5 million, 1.5 million
    and 1.0 million, respectively, of additional shares
    issuable upon the exercise of anti-dilutive options

and/or

the
    contingent vesting of performance-based restricted stock units
    that were excluded from the diluted share calculations.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements
    in accordance with FAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
    Payment” (“FAS 123R”), which requires all
    share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors to
    be expensed based on the grant date fair value of the awards
    over the requisite service period, adjusted

for estimated forfeitures. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
    valuation method to determine the grant date fair value of its
    stock option awards.

See Note 19 for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less, including
    investments in debt securities. Investments in debt securities
    are diversified among high-credit quality securities in
    accordance with the Company’s risk-management policies, and
    primarily include commercial paper and money market funds.

Restricted
    Cash

From time to time, the Company is required to place cash in
    escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure
    guarantees of corresponding amounts made by the banks to
    international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as
    to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain
    international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain
    international tax audits. As of March 28, 2009 and
    March 29, 2008, the Company had approximately
    $72 million and $110 million of cash held in escrow,
    respectively. Such cash has been classified as restricted cash
    and reported as a component of other non-current assets in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Short-term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company
    expects to convert into cash within one year, including time
    deposits which have a maturity greater than three months.
    Short-term investments are reported at cost, which approximates
    market value. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and
    purchase of short-term investments are classified as investing
    activities within the Company’s consolidated statements of
    cash flows.

Accounts
    Receivable

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to
    customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts
    receivable, net, as shown in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets, is net of certain reserves and allowances. These
    reserves and allowances consist of (a) reserves for
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks and (b) allowances
    for doubtful accounts. These reserves and allowances are
    discussed in further detail below.

A reserve for sales returns is determined based on an evaluation
    of current market conditions and historical returns experience.
    Charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

A reserve for trade discounts is determined based on open
    invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers,
    and charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

Estimated

end-of-season

markdown charges are included as reductions of revenue. The
    related markdown provisions are based on retail sales
    performance, seasonal negotiations with customers, historical
    deduction trends and an evaluation of current market conditions.

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
    deductions by customers relating to individual shipments.
    Charges to increase this reserve, net of expected recoveries,
    are included as reductions of revenue. The reserve is based on
    actual notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and past
    experience.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major
    department and specialty stores across the U.S., Europe and Asia
    and extends credit based on an evaluation of each
    customer’s financial condition, usually without requiring
    collateral. In its wholesale business, concentration of credit
    risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers
    and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, the
    Company has seven key department-store customers that generate
    significant sales volume. For Fiscal 2009, these customers in
    the aggregate contributed approximately 50% of all wholesale
    revenues. Further, as of March 28, 2009, the Company’s
    seven key department-store customers represented approximately
    40% of gross accounts receivable.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning product and all fashion
    product. Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined
    based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the
    Company’s individual product lines, the impact of market
    trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders
    in-house relating to future sales of inventory. Estimates may
    differ from actual results due to quantity,

F-11


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer
    preferences and market conditions. The Company’s historical
    estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed
    materially from actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.

Investments

Investments in companies in which the Company has significant
    influence, but less than a controlling voting interest, are
    accounted for using the equity method. This is generally
    presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of
    the investee. However, as a matter of policy, if the Company had
    a greater than 50% ownership interest in an investee and the
    minority shareholders held certain rights that allowed them to
    participate in the

day-to-day

operations of the business, the Company would also generally use
    the equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, only the Company’s investment in
    and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in
    the consolidated balance sheets; only the Company’s share
    of the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in the
    consolidated operating results; and only the dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the investee
    and additional cash investments, loan repayments or other cash
    paid to the investee are included in the consolidated cash flows.

Investments in companies in which the Company does not have a
    controlling interest, or is unable to exert significant
    influence, are accounted for as

available-for-sale

investments and, if the investments are publicly traded and
    there are no resale restrictions greater than one year, recorded
    at fair value. If resale restrictions greater than one year
    exist, or if the investment is not publicly traded, the
    investment is accounted for at cost.

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss
    positions for

other-than-temporary

impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a
    variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and
    uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and
    distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors
    considered by the Company include (i) the length of time
    and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost,
    (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and
    near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time
    to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market
    forecasts and (v) the Company’s intent and ability to
    retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
    for recovery of market value. The Company has not recognized any
    significant

other-than-temporary

impairment charges in any of the fiscal years presented.

Equity-method
    Investments

The Company’s investments include a joint venture named the
    Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL
    Watch Company”), formed with Financiere Richemont SA
    (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group, in March
    2007. The joint venture is a Swiss corporation, whose purpose is
    to design, develop, manufacture, sell and distribute luxury
    watches and fine jewelry through Ralph Lauren boutiques, as well
    as through fine independent jewelry and luxury watch retailers
    throughout the world. The Company accounts for its 50% interest
    in the RL Watch Company under the equity method of accounting,
    and such investment is classified in other non-current assets in
    the consolidated balance sheets. Royalty payments due to the
    Company under the related license agreement for use of certain
    of the Company’s trademarks will be reflected as licensing
    revenue within the consolidated statement of operations. The RL
    Watch Company commenced operations during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2008 and products were introduced in January 2009.

Available-for-sale

Investments

Investments also consisted of auction rate securities at a fair
    value of $2.3 million as of March 28, 2009 and
    $14.5 million as of March 29, 2008. Auction rate
    securities have characteristics similar to short-term
    investments because, at pre-determined short-term intervals,
    there is a new auction process at which the interest rates for
    these securities are reset to current interest rates. At the end
    of such periods, the Company chooses to either roll over its

F-12


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

holdings or seeks to redeem the investments for cash.
    Notwithstanding these short-term characteristics, the Company
    has classified these securities as non-current within other
    assets in its consolidated balance sheet as current market
    conditions call into question its ability to redeem these
    investments for cash within the next twelve months. Auction rate
    securities are categorized as

available-for-sale

investments and are stated at fair value. Unrealized gains or
    losses are classified as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses are
    classified as a component of interest and other income, net, in
    the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Cash
    inflows and outflows related to the sale and purchase of
    investments are classified as investing activities in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture,
    fixtures, computer software and computer equipment; from three
    to ten years for machinery and equipment; and from ten to forty
    years for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are
    depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
    the respective assets or the life of the lease.

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“FAS 144”). In evaluating
    long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-lived
    intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best
    estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of
    the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that
    estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the
    asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is
    recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of
    such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for
    which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the
    lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (“FAS 142”). At acquisition, the Company
    estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible
    assets, which primarily consist of license agreements, customer
    relationships, non-compete agreements and order backlog. The
    fair value of these intangible assets is estimated based on
    management’s assessment, considering independent third
    party appraisals, when necessary. The excess of the purchase
    consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is
    recorded as goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill, including
    any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain
    other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives
    are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually
    based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their
    carrying values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized
    over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with
    other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for
    impairment periodically whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may
    not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. See
    discussion of the Company’s accounting policy for
    long-lived asset impairment as described earlier under the
    caption

“Property and Equipment, Net.”

Officers’
    Life Insurance Policies

The Company maintains several whole-life and certain
    split-dollar life insurance policies for select senior
    executives. Whole-life policies are recorded at their
    cash-surrender value, and split-dollar policies are recorded at
    the lesser of their cash-surrender value or aggregate premiums

paid-to-date

in the consolidated balance sheets. As of the end of Fiscal 2009
    and Fiscal 2008, amounts of approximately $33 million and
    $48 million, respectively,

F-13


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

relating to officers’ life insurance policies held by the
    Company were classified within other non-current assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets.

In May 2009, the Company liquidated all of its whole-life
    insurance policies held at cash-surrender value. As of the end
    of Fiscal 2009, the related asset balance of approximately
    $16 million was classified within short-term investments in
    the consolidated balance sheet.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes” (“FAS 109”). Under this method,
    income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current
    taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded
    based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and
    include the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax
    reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of
    certain net operating loss, capital loss and general business
    credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amount of assets and
    liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as
    determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company
    accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or
    rates in the period of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when
    management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some
    portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

Effective April 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — An Interpretation of
    FAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”). Upon the
    adoption of the provisions of FIN 48, the Company changed
    its policy related to the accounting for income tax
    uncertainties. If the Company considers that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
    recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit
    by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains
    assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the
    Company’s estimates change or the final tax outcome of
    these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such
    differences will impact the income tax provision in the period
    in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment
    fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company
    regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the
    tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or
    analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of
    prevailing on the technical merits of the position to
    “more-likely-than-not”, (ii) the statute of
    limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an
    audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the
    appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as
    current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the
    next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded
    within the provision for income taxes in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the
    consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company’s
    income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48.

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment, including
    its retail stores. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for
    under the provisions of FAS No. 13, “Accounting
    for Leases,” and other related authoritative accounting
    literature (collectively, “FAS 13”). Certain of
    the Company’s leases contain renewal options, rent
    escalation clauses

and/or

landlord incentives. Rent expense for noncancelable operating
    leases with scheduled rent increases

and/or

landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement
    date. The excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled
    payment amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a
    deferred rent liability. As of the end of Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal
    2008, deferred rent

F-14


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligations of approximately $125 million and
    $112 million, respectively, were classified within other
    non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets.

For leases in which the Company is involved with the
    construction of the building (generally on land owned by the
    landlord), the Company accounts for the lease during the
    construction period under the provisions of EITF

No. 97-10,

“The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset
    Construction”

(“EITF 97-10”).

If the Company concludes that it has substantively all of the
    risks of ownership during construction of a leased property and
    therefore is deemed the owner of the project for accounting
    purposes, it records an asset and related financing obligation
    for the amount of total project costs related to

construction-in-progress

and the pre-existing building. Once construction is complete,
    the Company considers the requirements under
    FAS No. 98, “Accounting for Leases:
    Sale-Leaseback Transactions Involving Real Estate, Sales-Type
    Leases of Real Estate, Definition of Lease Term, and Initial
    Direct Costs of Direct Financing Leases,” for
    sale-leaseback treatment. If the arrangement does not qualify
    for sale-leaseback treatment, the Company continues to amortize
    the financing obligation and depreciate the building over the
    lease term.

Derivatives
    and Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance
    with FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and subsequent
    amendments (collectively, “FAS 133”).
    FAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition,
    FAS 133 provides that, for derivative instruments that
    qualify for hedge accounting, the effective portion of changes
    in the fair value are either (a) offset against the changes
    in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
    commitments through earnings or (b) recognized in
    stockholders’ equity until the hedged item is recognized in
    earnings, depending on whether the derivative is being used to
    hedge changes in fair value or cash flows, respectively.

Each derivative instrument entered into by the Company which
    qualifies for hedge accounting is considered highly effective at
    reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. For
    each derivative designated as a hedge, the Company formally
    documents the risk management objective and strategy, including
    the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item
    and the risk exposure, as well as how effectiveness is to be
    assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess
    effectiveness, the Company uses non-statistical methods,
    including the dollar-offset method, which compare the change in
    the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value
    or cash flows of the hedged item. The extent to which a hedging
    instrument has been and is expected to continue to be effective
    at achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is
    assessed and documented by the Company at least on a quarterly
    basis. Any ineffectiveness in hedging relationships is
    recognized immediately in earnings. If it is determined that a
    derivative has not been highly effective, and will continue not
    to be highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge
    accounting is discontinued.

All undesignated hedges of the Company are entered into to hedge
    specific economic risks, such as foreign currency exchange and
    interest rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative
    transactions for speculative or trading purposes. Changes in
    fair value relating to undesignated derivative instruments are
    immediately recognized in earnings.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is
    exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts
    will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only
    entering into contracts with carefully selected financial
    institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other
    financial factors, adhering to established limits for credit
    exposure. The Company’s established policies and procedures
    for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include
    continually reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of
    counterparties. As of March 28, 2009, the Company has
    approximately 48% of its derivative instruments in asset
    positions placed with one creditworthy financial institution.

For cash flow reporting purposes, the Company classifies
    proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a
    derivative instrument in the same manner as the related item
    being hedged.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments
    approximates fair value, except for certain differences relating
    to fixed-rate debt, investments in other entities accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting and certain other
    financial instruments. However, other than differences in the
    fair value of fixed-rate debt as disclosed in Note 14,
    these differences were not significant as of March 28, 2009
    or March 29, 2008. The fair value of financial instruments
    generally is determined by reference to fair market values
    resulting from the trading of the instruments on a national
    securities exchange or an

over-the-counter

market. In cases where quoted market prices are not available,
    fair value is based on estimates derived through the use of
    present value or other valuation techniques.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Fair
    Value Measurement

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157” or
    the “Standard”). FAS 157 defines “fair
    value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date within an
    identified principal or most advantageous market, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP
    and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. The
    Company adopted the provisions of FAS 157 for all of its
    financial assets and liabilities within the Standard’s
    scope as of the beginning of Fiscal 2009 (March 30, 2008).
    FAS 157 will become effective for all nonfinancial assets
    and liabilities of the Company within the scope of FAS 157
    as of the beginning of Fiscal 2010 (March 29, 2009). The
    adoption of the provisions of FAS 157 effective during
    Fiscal 2009 did not have a significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company
    does not expect that the provisions of FAS 157 to be
    adopted in Fiscal 2010 will have a material effect on its
    consolidated financial statements. See Note 15 for further
    discussion on the impact of adoption on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008
    (April 1, 2007) and recorded a related
    $62.5 million reduction in retained earnings as of
    April 1, 2007. See Note 13 for further discussion of
    the Company’s income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48.

Financial
    Statement Misstatements

In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 was issued in order to
    eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public
    companies quantify and evaluate financial statement
    misstatements.

Traditionally, there have been two widely-recognized methods for
    quantifying and evaluating the effects of financial statement
    misstatements: (i) the balance sheet (“iron
    curtain”) method and (ii) the income statement
    (“rollover”) method. The iron curtain method
    quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the
    misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the
    reporting period. The rollover method quantifies a misstatement
    based on the amount of the error originating in the current
    period income statement, including the reversing effect of prior
    year misstatements. The use of the rollover method can lead to
    the accumulation of

F-16


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

misstatements in the balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of
    SAB 108, the Company historically used the rollover method
    for quantifying and evaluating identified financial statement
    misstatements.

By issuing SAB 108, the SEC staff established an approach
    that requires quantification and evaluation of financial
    statement misstatements based on the effects of the
    misstatements under both the iron curtain and rollover methods.
    This model is commonly referred to as a “dual
    approach.”

SAB 108 required companies to initially apply its
    provisions either by (i) restating prior financial
    statements as if the dual approach had always been applied or
    (ii) recording the cumulative effect of initially applying
    the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal
    year, with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening
    balance of retained earnings. The Company adopted the provisions
    of SAB 108 in Fiscal 2007 and elected to record the effects
    of applying SAB 108 using the cumulative effect transition
    method and, as such, recorded a $16.9 million reduction in
    retained earnings as of April 2, 2006. The following table
    summarizes the effects of applying SAB 108 for each period
    in which the identified misstatement originated through
    April 2, 2006:

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123R”).
    FAS 123R supersedes both Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” (“APB 25”), which permitted the use of
    the intrinsic-value method in accounting for stock-based
    compensation, and FAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by
    FAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”
    (“FAS 123”), which allowed companies applying APB
    25 to just disclose in their financial statements the pro forma
    effect on net income from applying the fair-value method of
    accounting for stock-based compensation. FAS 123R requires
    all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors
    to be expensed based on the grant date fair value of the awards
    over the requisite service period. The Company adopted the
    provisions of FAS 123R effective as of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2007 and recorded a related $42.7 million
    reclassification within stockholders’ equity as of
    April 2, 2006. See Note 19 for further discussion of
    the Company’s stock-based compensation.

Other
    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“FAS 161”). FAS 161 amends
    FAS 133 to provide enhanced disclosure requirements
    surrounding how and why an entity uses derivative instruments,
    how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under FAS 133 and how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
    position, financial performance and cash flows. The Company
    adopted the disclosure requirements of FAS 161 as of the
    fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 (see Note 15). The adoption
    of FAS 161 did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141R”),
    which replaces FAS No. 141. FAS 141R was issued
    to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial
    reporting of business combinations, resulting in more complete,
    comparable and relevant information for investors and other
    users of financial statements. FAS 141R establishes
    principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business
    combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the
    goodwill acquired. Significant changes from current practice
    resulting from FAS 141R include the need for the acquirer
    to record 100% of all assets and liabilities of the acquired
    business, including goodwill, generally at their fair values for
    all business combinations (whether partial, full or step
    acquisitions); the need to recognize contingent consideration at
    its fair value on the acquisition date and, for certain
    arrangements, to recognize changes in fair value in earnings
    until settlement; and the need to expense acquisition-related
    transaction and restructuring costs rather than to treat them as
    part of the cost of the acquisition. FAS 141R also
    establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate
    the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    FAS 141R is effective for the Company as of the beginning
    of Fiscal 2010 and will be applied prospectively to business
    combinations that close on or after March 29, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an Amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“FAS 160”). FAS 160 establishes accounting
    and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests (previously
    referred to as “minority interests”) in a subsidiary
    and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary, to ensure
    consistency with the requirements of FAS 141R.
    FAS 160 states that noncontrolling interests should be
    classified as a separate component of equity, and establishes
    reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that
    clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the
    parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners.
    FAS 160 is effective for the Company as of the beginning of
    Fiscal 2010 and its application is not expected to have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of
    FAS No. 115” (“FAS 159”).
    FAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure, on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, financial instruments and certain other items at fair
    value that are

not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized
    gains and losses on items for which the fair value option is
    elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent
    reporting date. The Company did not elect the fair value option
    for any of its financial assets or financial liabilities upon
    adoption of FAS 159 in the beginning of Fiscal 2009.
    Therefore, the initial application of FAS 159 did not have
    a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Fiscal
    2009 Transactions

Agreement
    to Acquire Southeast Asia Licensed Operations

In February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with
    Dickson Concepts International Limited (“Dickson”) to
    assume direct control of its Polo-branded licensed apparel
    businesses in Southeast Asia effective January 1, 2010 in
    exchange for a payment of $20 million and certain other
    consideration. Dickson is currently the Company’s licensee
    for Polo-branded apparel in the Southeast Asia region, which is
    comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
    Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In connection with
    this agreement, the Company entered into a one-year extension of
    its underlying

sub-license

agreement with Dickson, which was originally scheduled to expire
    on December 31, 2008. The transaction is subject to certain
    customary closing conditions. The Company expects to account for
    this transaction as an asset purchase during the fourth quarter
    of Fiscal 2010.

Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition

On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the
    Polo-branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan
    from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai
    Co. Ltd. (“Naigai”) in exchange for a payment of
    approximately ¥2.8 billion (approximately
    $26 million as of the acquisition date) and certain other
    consideration (the “Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition”). The Company funded the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on-hand.
    Naigai was the Company’s licensee for childrenswear, golf
    apparel and hosiery under the

Polo by Ralph Lauren

and

Ralph Lauren

brands in Japan. In conjunction with the
    Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, the Company also
    entered into an additional

5-year

licensing and design-related agreement with Naigai for Polo and
    Chaps-branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services
    agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human
    resources and information systems-related services over a period
    of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the
    transaction.

The Company accounted for the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition as an asset purchase during the second quarter of
    Fiscal 2009. Based on the results of valuation analyses
    performed, the Company allocated all of the consideration
    exchanged in the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition to
    the net assets acquired in connection with the transaction. No
    settlement loss associated with any pre-existing relationships
    was recognized. The acquisition cost of $28 million
    (including transaction costs of approximately $2 million)
    has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on their
    respective fair values as follows: inventory of
    $16 million; customer relationship intangible asset of
    $13 million; and other net liabilities of $1 million.

The results of operations for the Polo-branded childrenswear and
    golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the
    Company’s results of operations commencing August 2,
    2008.

Fiscal
    2008 Transactions

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company acquired control of certain of
    its Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under
    licensed arrangements, consistent with the Company’s
    long-term strategy of international

F-19

expansion. In particular, the Company acquired approximately 77%
    of the outstanding shares of Impact 21 that it did not
    previously own in a cash tender offer (the “Impact 21
    Acquisition”), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact
    21 from approximately 20% to approximately 97%. Impact 21
    previously conducted the Company’s men’s, women’s
    and jeans apparel and accessories business in Japan under a
    pre-existing,

sub-license

arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in PRL Japan, which holds the master license to conduct
    Polo’s business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu
    (the “PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition”).
    Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan
    Minority Interest Acquisition are herein referred to as the
    “Japanese Business Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the
    Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately
    $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately
    $12 million. In February 2008, the Company acquired
    approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares
    outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. During the
    first quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company acquired the remaining
    2% of Impact 21 shares outstanding at an aggregate cost of
    approximately $9 million and completed the process of
    acquiring the remaining outstanding shares not exchanged as of
    the close of the tender offer period (the “minority
    squeeze-out”). As a result of these transactions, Impact 21
    is a 100%-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and ¥20.5 billion of borrowings
    under a one-year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment
    and restatement to the Company’s existing credit facility.
    The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on
    May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of Impact 21’s
    cash on-hand acquired as part of the acquisition.

Based on the results of valuation analyses performed, the
    Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    purchase of the Japanese businesses. The acquisition cost of
    approximately $374 million has been allocated to the net
    assets acquired based on their respective fair values as
    follows: cash of $189 million; trade receivables of
    $26 million; inventory of $38 million; finite-lived
    intangible assets of $75 million (consisting of the
    re-acquired licenses of $21 million and customer
    relationships of $54 million); non-tax-deductible goodwill
    of $140 million; assumed pension liabilities of
    $5 million; net deferred tax liabilities of
    $31 million; and other net liabilities of $58 million.

The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    within minority interest expense the amount of Impact 21’s
    net income allocable to the holders of the approximate 80% of
    the Impact 21 shares not owned by the Company prior to the
    closing date of the tender offer. The results of operations for
    PRL Japan had already been consolidated by the Company in all
    prior periods.

Acquisition
    of Small Leathergoods Business

On April 13, 2007, the Company acquired from Kellwood
    Company (“Kellwood”) substantially all of the assets
    of New Campaign, Inc., the Company’s licensee for
    men’s and women’s belts and other small leather goods
    under the

Ralph Lauren

,

Lauren

and

Chaps

brands in the U.S. (the “Small Leathergoods
    Business Acquisition”). The assets acquired from Kellwood
    are operated under the name of “Polo Ralph Lauren
    Leathergoods” and allowed the Company to further expand its
    accessories business. The acquisition cost was
    $10.4 million.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. As such, the
    Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition and no settlement gain
    or loss was recognized in connection with the transaction. The
    results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods
    business have been consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing April 1, 2007. In addition, the
    acquisition cost has been allocated as follows: inventory of
    $7.0 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
    $2.1 million (consisting of the re-acquired license of
    $1.3 million, customer

Formation
    of Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Joint Venture

In March 2007, the Company formed a joint venture with Richemont

    of the joint venture.

Fiscal
    2007 Transactions

Acquisition
    of RL Media Minority Interest

On March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    equity interest in RL Media formerly held by NBC (37.5%) and
    Value Vision (12.5%) (the “RL Media Minority Interest
    Acquisition”). RL Media conducts the Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through the RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com internet
    sites. The results of operations for RL Media have already been
    consolidated by the Company as described further in Note 2
    to the consolidated financial statements. The acquisition cost
    was $175 million.

The Company evaluated the terms of all significant pre-existing
    relationships between itself and RL Media to determine if a
    settlement of the pre-existing relationships existed. In
    addition, valuation analyses of RL Media were performed. Based
    on these analyses, as well as the rights and obligations of the
    parties under the RL Media partnership agreement, the Company
    determined that all of the consideration exchanged should be
    allocated to the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest.
    Accordingly, no settlement gain or loss was recognized in
    connection with this transaction.

The excess of the acquisition cost over the pre-existing
    minority interest liability of $33 million has been
    allocated as follows: inventory of $8 million; finite-lived
    intangible assets of $58 million (consisting of the
    re-acquired license of $56 million and customer list of
    $2 million); and tax-deductible goodwill of
    $76 million.

Supplemental
    Pro Forma Information

There were no acquisitions during Fiscal 2009 that had a
    material effect on the Company’s financial position and
    results of operations, and would have warranted the disclosure
    of related supplemental pro forma information. However,
    summarized below is certain supplemental pro forma information
    related to the Company’s significant acquisitions that
    occurred during Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007.

The following unaudited condensed pro forma information (herein
    referred to as the “pro forma information”) assumes
    the Japanese Business Acquisitions, the RL Media Minority
    Interest Acquisition and the Small Leathergoods Business
    Acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008 and
    Fiscal 2007 for the applicable fiscal years presented. The pro
    forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes
    only and is not necessarily indicative of the actual results
    that would have been attained had the acquisitions occurred as
    of the beginning of the fiscal years presented, nor is it
    indicative of the Company’s future results. Furthermore,
    the unaudited pro forma information does not reflect
    management’s estimate of any revenue-enhancing
    opportunities nor anticipated cost savings that may occur as a
    result of the integration and consolidation of the acquisitions.

The pro forma information set forth below reflects nonrecurring
    charges related to (a) the amortization of the

write-ups

to
    fair value of inventory included within cost of goods sold as

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 3, the Company accounts for goodwill
    and other intangible assets in accordance with FAS 142.
    Under FAS 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets
    deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not

amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Finite-lived
    intangible assets continue to be amortized over their respective
    estimated useful lives. Based on the results of the
    Company’s annual impairment testing of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets in Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008
    and Fiscal 2007, no impairment charges were deemed necessary.

Impairments
    of Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. In
    evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company
    uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the
    extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
    attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between
    the carrying value of such asset and its fair value.

Fiscal
    2009 Impairment

During Fiscal 2009, the Company recorded total non-cash
    impairment charges of $55.4 million to reduce the net
    carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated
    fair value, which was determined based on discounted expected
    cash flows. Total Fiscal 2009 impairment charges were comprised
    of $7.2 million recorded during the second quarter and
    $48.2 million recorded during the fourth quarter.

Total Fiscal 2009 impairment charges included a
    $52.0 million write-down of Retail store assets and a
    $3.4 million write-down of certain capitalized software
    costs (primarily in the Wholesale segment) that were determined
    to no longer be used over the intended service period. The
    Retail store asset impairment was associated with

lower-than-expected

operating performance for the fiscal year for certain

Ralph
    Lauren

,

Club Monaco

and

full-price
    stores primarily located in the U.S. due in part to the
    significant contraction in consumer spending experienced during
    the latter half of the fiscal year and which is expected to
    continue to negatively impact such stores’ future operating
    performance.

Fiscal
    2008 Impairment

During Fiscal 2008, the Company recorded non-cash impairment
    charges of $5.0 million to reduce the carrying value of
    certain long-lived assets in its Retail segment to their
    estimated fair value. These impairment charges were primarily
    recorded as a result of

lower-than-expected

operating cash flow performance for certain stores that, along
    with projections of future performance, indicated that the
    carrying values of the related fixed assets were not recoverable.

No impairment charges were recorded in Fiscal 2007.

12.

Restructuring

The Company has recorded restructuring liabilities in recent
    years relating to various cost-savings initiatives, as well as
    certain of its acquisitions. Through Fiscal 2009, in accordance
    with US GAAP, restructuring costs incurred in connection with
    acquisitions were capitalized as part of the purchase accounting
    for the transaction. Such acquisition-related restructuring
    costs were not material in any period. Liabilities for costs
    associated with

F-25


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

non-acquisition-related restructuring initiatives are expensed
    and initially measured at fair value when incurred in accordance
    with US GAAP. A description of the nature of significant
    non-acquisition-related restructuring activities and related
    costs is presented below.

Fiscal
    2009 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company initiated
    a restructuring plan designed to better align its cost base with
    the slowdown in consumer spending negatively affecting sales and
    operating margins and to improve overall operating effectiveness
    (the “Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan”). The Fiscal
    2009 Restructuring Plan included the termination of
    approximately 500 employees and the closure of certain
    underperforming retail stores.

In connection with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, the
    Company recorded $20.8 million in restructuring charges
    during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009. A summary of the
    activity in the related liability is as follows:

Primarily related to write-downs of

Payments related to severance and benefits and lease termination
    costs are expected to be paid in full primarily by the end of
    Fiscal 2010.

In addition to those restructuring charges incurred in
    connection with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan implemented
    during the fourth quarter as discussed above, the Company
    recognized $2.8 million of other restructuring charges
    earlier in the fiscal year, primarily related to severance costs
    associated with the transition of certain sourcing and
    production facilities in Southeast Asia during Fiscal 2009.

There were no significant restructuring charges recognized by
    the Company during Fiscal 2008.

Fiscal
    2007 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company initiated
    a plan to restructure its Club Monaco retail business. In
    particular, this plan consisted of the closure of all five Club
    Monaco factory stores and the intention to dispose of by sale or
    closure all eight of the Caban Concept Stores (collectively, the
    “Club Monaco Restructuring Plan”). In connection with
    this plan, during Fiscal 2007 the Company ultimately decided to
    close all of the Caban Concept Stores and recognized
    $4.0 million of associated restructuring charges, primarily
    relating to lease termination costs. The remaining liability
    under the plan was $0.9 million as of March 28, 2009.

Additionally, the Company recognized $0.6 million of other
    restructuring charges primarily related to severance costs
    associated with the transition of certain sourcing and
    production functions from Colombia to the U.S. during
    Fiscal 2007.

The Company has available federal, state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards of $0.5 million,
    $6.8 million and $13.8 million, respectively, for tax
    purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss
    carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal 2010. The utilization
    of the federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to
    the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which
    applies following certain changes in ownership of the entity
    generating the loss carryforward.

Also, the Company has available state and foreign net operating
    loss carryforwards of $7.9 million and $11.0 million,
    respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been
    recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded since
    management does not believe that the Company will more likely
    than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future
    taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax
    assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such
    recognition. The valuation allowance increased by
    $4.5 million in Fiscal 2009 as a result of the inability to
    utilize certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign
    taxes on $841.4 million of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings have been and are expected
    to continue to be reinvested. These earnings could become
    subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign
    earnings were lent to Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation
    (“PRLC”), a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of
    PRLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries were sold.
    Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
    liability with respect to such earnings is not practical.
    Management believes that the amount of the additional taxes that
    might be payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if
    remitted, would be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax
    credits.

Uncertain
    Income Tax Benefits

Impact of
    FIN 48 Adoption

As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized a $62.5 million reduction in retained earnings
    as the cumulative effect to adjust its net liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits as of April 1, 2007. This
    adjustment consisted of a $99.9 million increase to the
    Company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, offset
    in part by a $37.4 million increase to the Company’s
    deferred tax assets principally representing the value of future
    tax benefits that could be realized at the U.S. federal
    level if the related liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
    at the state and local levels ultimately are required to be
    settled. The total balance of unrecognized tax benefits,
    including interest and penalties, was $173.8 million as of
    April 1, 2007.

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as part of its provision for income
    taxes. Accordingly, included in the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits was a liability for interest and penalties in the
    amount of $45.7 million as of April 1, 2007.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including

    March 28, 2009 and was included within non-current
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated
    balance sheet. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits,
    including interest and penalties, was $165.5 million as of
    March 29, 2008, of which $10.3 was included within accrued
    expenses and other and $155.2 million was included within
    non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the
    consolidated balance sheet. The total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s
    effective tax rate was $117.1 million as of March 28,
    2009 and $123.6 million as of March 29, 2008.

Future
    Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the
    Company’s tax positions is subject to change based on
    future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of
    ongoing audits

and/or

the
    expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the
    outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, it is
    reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax
    benefits, excluding interest and penalties, could potentially be
    reduced by up to approximately $25 million during the next
    12 months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected
    outcomes and timing of those events could cause the
    Company’s current estimate to change materially in the
    future.

Euro
    Debt

The Company has outstanding approximately €300 million
    principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013
    (the “Euro Debt”). The Company has the option to
    redeem all of the Euro Debt at any time at a redemption price
    equal to the principal amount plus a premium. The Company also
    has the option to redeem all of the Euro Debt at any time at par
    plus accrued interest in the event of certain developments
    involving U.S. tax law. Partial redemption of the Euro Debt
    is not permitted in either instance. In the event of a change of
    control of the Company, each holder of the Euro Debt has the
    option to require the Company to redeem the Euro Debt at its
    principal amount plus accrued interest. The indenture governing
    the Euro Debt (the “Indenture”) contains certain
    limited covenants that restrict the Company’s ability,
    subject to specified exceptions, to incur liens or enter into a
    sale and leaseback transaction for any principal property. The
    Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.

The Company may from time to time repurchase all or a portion of
    its Euro Debt in the open market, via tender offer or otherwise.

Refer to Note 15 for discussion of the designation of the
    Company’s Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries.

Revolving
    Credit Facility and Term Loan

The Company has a credit facility that provides for a
    $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through
    November 2011 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
    Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of March 28, 2009, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility, and the Company was
    contingently liable for $13.7 million of outstanding
    letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase
    commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its
    borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the
    agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
    facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory
    reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the
    Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility

F-31


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. The Credit Facility also requires the Company to
    maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated
    EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”) of no greater than 3.75
    as of the date of measurement for four consecutive quarters.
    Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt
    outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent expense for the last
    twelve months. EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net
    income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest
    expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and
    (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of March 28, 2009,
    no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the
    Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s Credit
    Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenant described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of
    Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities
    controlled by Mr. Lauren fail to maintain a specified
    minimum percentage of the voting power of the Company’s
    common stock.

The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22,
    2007 to provide for the addition of a ¥20.5 billion
    loan (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan was made to Polo
    JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and was
    guaranteed by the Company, as well as the other subsidiaries of
    the Company which currently guarantee the Credit Facility. The
    proceeds of the Term Loan were used to finance the Japanese
    Business Acquisitions. Borrowings under the Term Loan bore
    interest at a fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the
    borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using
    $196.8 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as
    part of the acquisition. See Note 5 for further discussion
    of the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

Fair
    Value of Debt

Based on the prevailing level of market interest rates as of
    March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008, the carrying value
    of the Company’s Euro Debt exceeded its fair value by
    approximately $86 million and $50 million,
    respectively. As of March 31, 2008, the carrying value of
    the Company’s Term Loan approximated its fair value.
    Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not result in the
    realization or expenditure of cash, unless the debt is retired
    prior to its maturity.

Fair
    Value Measurement

FAS 157 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for
    disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the
    applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular asset or
    liability depends on the inputs

F-32


POLO

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

used in valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent
    to which the inputs are market-based (observable) or internally
    derived (unobservable). The three levels are defined as follows:

•

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets for substantially the full term of
    the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the
    full term of the financial instrument; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are
    observable.

•

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques
    that are significant to the fair value measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the
    valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that
    is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table summarizes the Company’s financial
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring

Based on Level 2 measurements.

Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges
    are recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets and, to the extent these instruments are highly
    effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
    being hedged, the related unrealized gains or losses are
    deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company’s
    derivative financial instruments are valued using a pricing
    model, primarily based on market observable external inputs
    including forward and spot rates for foreign currencies, which
    considers the impact of the Company’s own credit risk, if
    any. The Company mitigates the impact of counterparty credit
    risk by entering into contracts with select financial
    institutions based on credit ratings and other factors, adhering
    to established limits for credit exposure and continually
    assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. Changes in
    counterparty credit risk are considered in the valuation of
    derivative financial instruments. The Company’s derivative
    financial instruments have been classified as Level 2
    assets or liabilities as of March 28, 2009.

The Company’s auction rate securities are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and are recorded at fair value in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets, with unrealized gains and losses
    deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Third-party
    pricing institutions may value auction rate securities at par,
    which may not necessarily reflect prices that would be obtained
    in the current market. When quoted market prices are
    unobservable, fair value is estimated based on a number of known
    factors and external pricing data, including known maturity
    dates, the coupon rate based upon the most recent reset market
    clearing rate, the price/yield representing the average rate of
    recently successful traded securities, and the total

principal balance of each security. Auction rate securities have
    been classified as Level 2 assets as of March 28, 2009.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts
    receivable are recorded at carrying value, which approximates
    fair value. Restricted cash is reported at carrying value. The
    Company’s Euro Debt, which is adjusted for foreign currency
    fluctuations, is also reported at carrying value.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company primarily has exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash
    flows from its international operations and possible declines in
    the fair value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign
    operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, the Company periodically uses derivative financial
    instruments to manage such risks.

    derivative instruments and the related impact on its

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that approximately
    $23 million of net gains deferred in accumulated other
    comprehensive income related to foreign currency exchange
    contracts outstanding as of March 28, 2009 will be
    recognized in earnings. The Company recognized an aggregate net
    gain on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of
    approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2007. The Company
    recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income the
    translation effects of the Euro Debt to U.S. dollars,
    resulting in an aggregate loss of $30.8 million for Fiscal
    2007. No material gains or losses relating to ineffective hedges
    were recognized during any of the fiscal years presented.

The following is a summary of the Company’s risk management
    strategies and the effect of those strategies on the
    consolidated financial statements.

F-35


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange rate
    fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty
    payments made by certain of its international operations,
    intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing
    efforts of its international operations, interest payments made
    in connection with outstanding debt, other foreign
    currency-denominated operational obligations including payroll,
    rent, insurance and benefit payments, and foreign
    currency-denominated revenues. As part of its overall strategy
    to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of
    the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British
    Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign
    currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve-month to
    two-year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts that generally have maturities of
    three months to two years to provide continuing coverage
    throughout the hedging period.

The Company records its foreign currency exchange contracts at
    fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency
    exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at hedge
    inception are accounted for in accordance with FAS 133. As
    such, to the extent these hedges are effective, the related
    gains (losses) are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These
    deferred gains (losses) are then recognized in our consolidated
    statements of operations as follows:

•

Forecasted Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as
    part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of
    goods sold when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments

and

Marketing
    Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency
    gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Operational Obligations

— Recognized primarily
    within SG&A expenses in the period in which the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings.

•

Interest Payments on Euro Debt

— Recognized
    within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which
    the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency
    exchange remeasurement.

To the extent that any of these foreign currency exchange
    contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in
    offsetting the change in the value of the hedged item, any
    changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are
    immediately recognized in earnings. If a hedge relationship is
    terminated, the change in fair value of the derivative
    previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is
    realized when the hedged item affects earnings consistent with
    the original hedging strategy, unless the forecasted transaction
    is no longer probable of occurring in which case the accumulated
    amount is immediately recognized in earnings. In addition,
    changes in fair value relating to undesignated foreign currency
    exchange contracts are immediately recognized in earnings.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company designated the entire principal amount of its
    outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries. As required by
    FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative
    instrument or a non-derivative financial instrument (such as
    debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a
    foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a
    translation adjustment under FAS No. 52, “Foreign
    Currency Translation,” to the extent it is effective as a
    hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the Euro Debt
    resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and
    continue to be, reported in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

F-36


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In assessing effectiveness, the Company uses the spot rate
    method of accounting to value foreign currency exchange rate
    changes in both its foreign subsidiaries and the derivative
    designated as a hedge of a net investment. If the notional
    amount of the derivative designated as a hedge of a net
    investment is greater than the portion of the net investment
    being hedged, hedge ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in
    earnings. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument
    are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income until the sale or
    liquidation of the hedged net investment.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered
    into three forward-starting interest rate swap contracts in
    anticipation of the Company’s proposed refinancing of the
    1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in October 2006. These
    contracts were designated as cash flow hedges of a forecasted
    transaction to issue new debt in connection with the planned
    refinancing. The interest rate swaps hedged a total of
    €200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest
    rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of
    the swaps, the Company paid a weighted-average fixed rate of
    interest of 4.1% and received variable interest based on
    six-month EURIBOR. The Company terminated the swaps on
    September 28, 2006, which was the date the interest rate
    for the Euro Debt was determined. As a result, the Company made
    a payment of approximately €3.5 million
    ($4.4 million) in settlement of the swaps. An amount of
    $0.2 million was recognized as a loss in Fiscal 2007 due to
    the partial ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result
    of the forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006
    instead of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999
    Euro Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million was deferred
    as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity and is being recognized in earnings as an adjustment to
    interest expense over the seven-year term of the Euro Debt.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

The Company operates its retail stores under various leasing
    arrangements. The Company also occupies various office and
    warehouse facilities and uses certain equipment under numerous
    lease agreements. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for
    under the provisions of FAS 13 as either operating leases
    or capital leases. In this context, capital leases include
    leases whereby the Company is considered to have the substantive
    risks of ownership during construction of a leased property
    pursuant to the provisions of

EITF 97-10.

Information on the Company’s operating and capital leasing
    activities is set forth below.

Operating
    Leases

The Company is typically required to make minimum rental
    payments, and often contingent rental payments, under its
    operating leases. Substantially all factory and full-price
    retail store leases provide for contingent rentals based upon
    sales, and certain rental agreements require payment based
    solely on a percentage of sales. Terms of the Company’s
    leases generally contain renewal options, rent escalation
    clauses and landlord incentives. Rent expense, net of sublease
    income which was not significant, was approximately
    $237 million in Fiscal 2009, $208 million in Fiscal
    2008 and $172 million in Fiscal 2007. Such amounts include
    contingent rental charges of approximately $16 million for
    Fiscal 2009, $14 million for Fiscal 2008 and
    $12 million for Fiscal 2007. In addition to such amounts,
    the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and
    occupancy costs relating to the leased real estate properties.

Litigation

California
    Class Action Litigation

On October 11, 2007 and November 2, 2007, two class
    action lawsuits were filed by two customers in state court in
    California asserting that while they were shopping at certain of
    the Company’s factory stores in California, the Company
    allegedly required them to provide certain personal information
    at the

point-of-sale

in order to complete a credit card purchase. The plaintiffs
    purported to represent a class of customers in California who
    allegedly were injured by being forced to provide their address
    and telephone numbers in order to use their credit cards to
    purchase items from the Company’s stores, which allegedly
    violated Section 1747.08 of California’s Song-Beverly
    Act. The complaints sought an unspecified amount of statutory
    penalties, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. The
    Company subsequently had the actions moved to the United States
    District Court for the Eastern and Central Districts of
    California. The Company commenced mediation proceedings with
    respect to these lawsuits and on October 17, 2008, the
    Company agreed in principle to settle these claims by agreeing
    to issue $20 merchandise discount coupons with six month
    expiration dates to eligible parties and paying the
    plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The terms of the final
    settlement remain subject to court approval. In connection with
    this settlement, the Company recorded a $5 million reserve
    against its expected loss exposure during the second quarter of
    Fiscal 2009.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd.
    (“Wathne”), our domestic licensee for luggage and
    handbags, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in
    the Southern District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren,
    our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other
    things, federal trademark law violations, breach of contract,
    breach of obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and
    negligent misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other
    relief, injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. We believe this lawsuit to be without
    merit, and moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims.
    Wathne cross-moved for partial summary judgment. A hearing on
    these motions occurred on November 1, 2007. The judge
    presiding in this case provided a written ruling on the summary
    judgment motion on April 11, 2008. The Court granted
    Polo’s summary judgment motion to dismiss in large measure,
    and denied Wathne’s cross-motion. Wathne appealed the
    dismissal of its claims and a hearing in connection with this
    appeal was held before the Appellate Division of the Supreme
    Court on May 19, 2009. A ruling from the Appellate Division
    with respect to this appeal is not expected for several months.
    A trial date has not yet been established in connection with
    this matter. We intend to continue to contest the remaining
    claims in this lawsuit vigorously. Accordingly, management does
    not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or
    financial position.

California
    Labor Law Litigation

On March 2, 2006, a former employee at our Club Monaco
    store in Los Angeles, California filed a lawsuit against the
    Company in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiff
    purported to represent a class of Club Monaco store employees
    who allegedly were injured by being improperly classified as
    exempt employees and thereby did not receive compensation for
    overtime and did not receive meal and rest breaks. The complaint
    sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,

disgorgement of profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    relief. On August 21, 2007, eleven former and then current
    employees of the Company’s Club Monaco stores in California
    filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging similar
    claims as the Club Monaco action in San Francisco. The
    complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    attorneys’ fees and punitive damages. The parties to these
    two Club Monaco litigations agreed to retain a mediator in an
    effort to resolve both matters and agreed to settle all claims
    involving both litigations at an aggregate cost of
    $1.2 million. The terms of the settlement were recently
    approved by both the Los Angeles and San Francisco courts.

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging
    violations of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs
    purport to represent a class of employees who allegedly have
    been injured by not properly being paid commission earnings, not
    being paid overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to
    work off of the clock while waiting to enter or leave the store
    and being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave the store.
    The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory
    damages, damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of
    profits, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    and declaratory relief. We have filed a cross-claim against one
    of the plaintiffs for his role in allegedly assisting a former
    employee to misappropriate Company property. Subsequent to
    answering the complaint, we had the action moved to the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California.
    On July 8, 2008, the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California granted plaintiffs’ motion
    for class certification. We believe this suit is without merit
    and intend to contest it vigorously. Accordingly, management
    does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity
    or financial position.

Club
    Monaco International Licensing Litigation

On May 15, 2009, the Company’s subsidiary, Club Monaco
    Corp., commenced an action in the Supreme Court of the State of
    New York, New York County, against LCJG Distribution Co., Ltd.
    (“LCJG”) and Lane Crawford Joyce Group Limited
    (“Lane Crawford”). LCJG is a Club Monaco Corp.
    licensee in Asia pursuant to a Club Monaco Store License
    Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2005 (as amended, the
    “License Agreement”). Lane Crawford is the guarantor
    of LCJG’s obligations under the License Agreement, pursuant
    to a Guaranty, dated as of February 28, 2005, which was
    executed by Lane Crawford (the “Guaranty”). The
    License Agreement requires that LCJG pay royalties and other
    payments to Club Monaco Corp. for the use by LCJG of the Club
    Monaco brand in connection with the operation of various Club
    Monaco stores in Asia. Club Monaco Corp.’s Complaint
    alleges that LCJG and Lane Crawford have breached the License
    Agreement and Guaranty by, among other things, failing to pay
    Club Monaco certain royalties and other payments which both LCJG
    and Lane Crawford are responsible for under the License
    Agreement and Guaranty. Management does not expect that the
    ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s liquidity, financial position or
    results of operations.

Credit
    Card Matter

In the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company was notified of
    an alleged compromise of its retail store information systems
    that process its credit card data for certain Club Monaco stores
    in Canada. As of the end of Fiscal 2007, the Company had
    recorded a total reserve of $5.0 million for this matter
    based on its best estimate of its potential exposure at that
    time. In October 2008, the Company was notified that this matter
    had been fully resolved. The Company’s aggregate losses in
    this matter were less than $0.4 million. The Company
    reversed $4.1 million of its original $5.0 million
    reserve into income during Fiscal 2008 based on favorable
    developments in this matter at that point, and the remaining
    $0.5 million excess reserve was reversed into income during
    the second quarter of Fiscal 2009.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims and
    proceedings involving credit card fraud, trademark and
    intellectual property, licensing, employee relations and other

    individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition or results of operations.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Capital
    Stock

The Company’s capital stock consists of two classes of
    common stock. There are 500 million shares of Class A
    common stock and 100 million shares of Class B common
    stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and
    Class B common stock have substantially identical rights,
    except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A
    common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of
    Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share.
    Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class
    on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval,
    except with respect to the election and removal of directors or
    as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares
    of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

In May 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an
    expansion of the Company’s existing common stock repurchase
    program that allows the Company to repurchase up to an
    additional $250 million of Class A common stock.
    Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject
    to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2009,
    1.8 million shares of Class A common stock were
    repurchased by the Company at a cost of $126.2 million
    under its repurchase program. Also, during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of
    Fiscal 2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. The
    remaining availability under the common stock repurchase program
    was approximately $266 million as of March 28, 2009.

In addition, in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $19.6 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as
    amended and restated.

In Fiscal 2008, share repurchases amounted to 6.1 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $476.4 million, including $24.0 million
    (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of
    the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. In
    addition, in Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under
    the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as
    amended and restated.

In Fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 3.5 million shares
    of Class A common stock at a cost of $231.3 million.

Dividends

Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash
    dividend of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per share on an annual
    basis, on its common stock. Dividends paid amounted to
    $19.9 million in Fiscal 2009, $20.5 million in Fiscal
    2008 and $20.9 million in Fiscal 2007.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable ratably
    (a graded-vesting schedule), over a three-year vesting period.
    Stock options generally expire seven years from the date of
    grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have graded vesting and no performance
    conditions on an accelerated basis. The Company uses the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of
    stock options granted, which requires the input of both
    subjective and objective assumptions as follows:

Expected Term

— The estimate of expected term
    is based on the historical exercise behavior of employees and
    non-employee directors, as well as the contractual life of the
    option grants.

Expected Volatility

— The expected volatility
    factor is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock for a period equal to the stock
    option’s expected term.

Expected Dividend Yield

— The expected dividend
    yield is based on the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05
    per share.

Risk-free Interest Rate

— The risk-free
    interest rate is determined using the implied yield for a traded
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the
    option’s expected term.

The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used to estimate

Restricted
    Stock and RSUs

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based RSUs to certain of its senior executives
    and non-employee directors. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to such senior executives and other key
    executives, and certain other employees of the Company.

Restricted shares of Class A common stock, which entitle
    the holder to receive a specified number of shares of
    Class A common stock at the end of a vesting period, are
    accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. In addition,
    holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash
    dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the
    Company’s Class A common stock. Generally, restricted
    stock grants vest over a five-year period of time, subject to
    the executive’s continuing employment. Restricted stock
    shares granted to non-employee directors vest over a three-year
    period of time.

RSUs entitle the grantee to receive shares of Class A
    common stock at the end of a vesting period. Service-based RSUs
    are payable in shares of Class A common stock and generally
    vest over a five-year period of time, subject to the
    executive’s continuing employment. Performance-based RSUs
    also are payable in shares of Class A common stock and
    generally vest (a) upon the completion of a three-year
    period of time (cliff vesting), subject to the

    period or (b) ratably, over a three-year period of time

    prior to Fiscal 2008 or (ii) solely in the initial year of
    the vesting period for grants made in and after Fiscal 2008. In
    addition, holders of certain RSUs are entitled to receive
    dividend equivalents in the form of additional RSUs in
    connection with the payment of dividends on the Company’s
    Class A common stock. RSUs, including shares resulting from
    dividend equivalents paid on such units, are accounted for at
    fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of a restricted
    security is based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A
    common stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends
    for those restricted securities that are not entitled to
    dividend equivalents. Compensation expense for performance-based
    RSUs is recognized over the related service period when
    attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Profit
    Sharing Retirement Savings Plans

The Company sponsors two defined contribution benefit plans
    covering substantially all eligible U.S. employees not
    covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include
    a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal
    Revenue Code. The Company makes discretionary contributions to
    the plans and contributes an amount equal to 50% of the first 6%
    of salary contributed by an employee.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is 100% vested in
    Company matching and discretionary contributions after five
    years of credited service. Contributions made by the Company
    under these plans approximated $6 million in both Fiscal
    2009 and Fiscal 2008, and $4 million in Fiscal 2007.

Supplemental
    Retirement Plan

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for
    certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the
    401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans are expected to
    be constrained by the operation of certain Internal Revenue Code
    limitations. These supplemental benefits vest over time and the
    related compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period.

In August 2008, the Company amended its non-qualified
    supplemental retirement plan. The amendments included a
    suspension of the annual contributions for substantially all
    plan participants effective for Fiscal 2009. Further, affected
    participants were provided with a one-time election to either
    withdraw all benefits vested in the plan in a lump sum amount
    during the first quarter of Fiscal 2010 or remain in the plan
    and receive future distributions of benefits vested over a

5-year

period.

The amount accrued under this plan was $29 million as of
    March 28, 2009, comprised of $18 million classified
    within accrued expenses and other and $11 million
    classified within other non-current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. An amount of $29 million was
    accrued under this plan as of March 29, 2008 and was
    classified within other non-current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet. Total compensation expense
    recognized related to these benefits was $2 million,
    $4 million and $3 million in Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008
    and Fiscal 2007, respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plans

The Company has deferred compensation arrangements for certain
    key executives which generally provide for payments upon
    retirement, death or termination of employment. The amounts
    accrued under these plans were approximately $2 million as
    of both March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008, and were
    classified within other non-current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense related
    to these compensation arrangements was $0.3 million in each
    of the three fiscal years presented. The Company funds a portion
    of these obligations through the establishment of trust accounts
    on behalf of the executives participating in the plans. The
    trust accounts are classified within other assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Union
    Pension Plan

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is
    required to make contributions to the UNITE HERE (which was
    previously known as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
    Textile Employees, prior to its merger with the Hotel Employees
    and Restaurant Employees International Union)
    (“Union”) for dues based on wages paid to union
    employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to
    a retirement fund which provides defined benefits to
    substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not
    participate in the management of the plan and has not been
    furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits
    provided, vested and non-vested benefits or assets.

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a
    multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its
    proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits.
    Such withdrawal liability was assumed in conjunction with the
    acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee.
    The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the
    plan.

International
    Defined Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit
    plans and participates in a multi-employer defined benefit plan
    at international locations, which are not considered to be
    material individually or in the aggregate. Pension benefits
    under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the
    employees’ years of service and compensation levels during
    their employment period. The aggregate funded status of the
    single-employer defined benefit plans were net liabilities of
    $7.3 million and $6.6 million as of March 28,
    2009 and March 29, 2008, respectively, primarily recorded
    within other non-current liabilities in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. These single-employer defined
    benefit plans had aggregate projected benefit obligations of
    $26.9 million and aggregate fair values of plan assets of
    $22.9 million as of March 28, 2009, compared to
    projected benefit obligations of $21.3 million and fair
    values of plan assets of $18.8 million as of March 29,
    2008. Pension expense for these plans, recorded within SG&A
    expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations, was $4.0 million in Fiscal 2009,
    $3.6 million in Fiscal 2008 and $2.2 million in Fiscal
    2007.

On March 31, 2009, the Company withdrew from the remaining
    multi-employer defined benefit plan assumed in the Japanese
    Business Acquisitions. A related withdrawal liability of
    approximately $4 million is classified within other
    non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets as of March 28, 2009 and March 29,
    2008. Total contributions to the multi-employer plan were
    $0.6 million and $0.5 million in Fiscal 2009 and
    Fiscal 2008, respectively. The Company did not participate in
    any multi-employer defined benefit plans in Fiscal 2007.

On April 1, 2009, the Company integrated all of its
    Japanese single-employer defined benefit plans into one defined
    contribution and cash balance plan (the “Integrated Japan
    Pension Plan”). The opening balance of the projected
    benefit obligation for the Integrated Japan Pension Plan was
    approximately $6.0 million. As a result of this
    integration, certain of the Company’s pre-existing Japanese
    single-employer defined benefit plans were settled. The Company
    expects to record a related settlement charge of approximately
    $0.4 million in the consolidated statement of operations
    during the first quarter of Fiscal 2010.

21.

Segment
    Information

The Company has three reportable segments based on its business
    activities and organization: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.
    Such segments offer a variety of products through different
    channels of distribution. The Wholesale segment consists of
    women’s, men’s and children’s apparel,
    accessories and related products which are sold to major
    department stores, specialty stores, golf and pro shops and the
    Company’s owned and licensed retail stores in the
    U.S. and overseas. The Retail segment consists of the
    Company’s worldwide retail operations, which sell products
    through its full-price and factory stores, as well as
    RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com, its

e-commerce

websites. The stores and websites sell products purchased from
    the Company’s licensees, suppliers and Wholesale segment.
    The Licensing segment generates revenues from royalties earned
    on the sale of the Company’s apparel, home and other
    products internationally and domestically through licensing
    alliances. The licensing agreements grant the licensees rights
    to use the Company’s various trademarks in connection with
    the manufacture and sale of designated products in specified
    geographical areas for specified periods.

The accounting policies of the Company’s segments are
    consistent with those described in Note 3. Sales and
    transfers between segments generally are recorded at cost and
    treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are
    eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating
    segment performance. Each segment’s performance is
    evaluated based upon operating income before restructuring
    charges and certain other one-time items, such as legal charges,
    if any. Corporate overhead expenses (exclusive of certain
    expenses for senior

Related
    Party Transactions

In the ordinary course of conducting its business, the Company
    periodically enters into transactions with other entities or
    people that are considered related parties.

In connection with the launch of the RL Watch Company business,
    the Company will begin to receive royalty payments pursuant to a
    related licensing agreement that allows the RL Watch Company to
    sell luxury watches and fine jewelry throughout the world using
    certain of the Company’s trademarks. The Company has a 50%
    interest in the RL Watch Company, which is accounted for under
    the equity method of accounting. See Note 3 for further
    discussion of the Company’s investment in the RL Watch
    Company.

Prior to the Japanese Business Acquisitions that occurred in May
    2007, the Company received royalty payments pursuant to a
    licensing agreement with Impact 21 that allowed Impact 21 to
    sell high quality apparel and related merchandise in Japan using
    certain of the Company’s trademarks. The Company had an
    approximately 20% interest in Impact 21, which was accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting. Royalty payments received
    under this arrangement were approximately $34 million in
    Fiscal 2007. See Note 5 for further discussion of the
    Company’s Japanese Business Acquisitions.

In addition, Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer, sometimes used the services of
    certain employees of the Company for non-Company related
    purposes in Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007. Mr. Lauren
    reimbursed the Company for the direct expenses incurred in
    connection with those services, including an allocation of such
    employees’ salaries and benefits. Such aggregate costs and
    related reimbursements were less than $1 million in both
    Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007. No related services were provided
    by the Company to Mr. Lauren in Fiscal 2009.

    obligations in the net amount of $13.0 million for Fiscal
    2009 and $39.8 million for Fiscal 2008. Significant
    non-cash investing activities also included the non-cash
    allocation of the fair value of the net assets acquired in
    connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    in Fiscal 2009, the Japanese Business Acquisitions and the Small
    Leathergoods Business Acquisition in Fiscal 2008, and the RL
    Media Minority Interest Acquisition in Fiscal 2007. See
    Note 5 for further discussion of the Company’s
    acquisitions.

Significant non-cash financing activities included the
    repurchase of 0.4 million shares of Class A common
    stock at a cost of $24.0 million that was traded prior to
    the end of Fiscal 2008 for which settlement occurred in April
    2008. In addition, as a result of the adoption of FIN 48,
    the Company recognized a non-cash reduction in retained earnings
    of $62.5 million as the cumulative effect to adjust its net
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of April 1, 2007.

There were no other significant non-cash investing or financing
    activities for the three fiscal years presented.

Licensing-related
    Transactions

Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement

In February 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into
    a ten-year exclusive licensing agreement with Luxottica Group,
    S.p.A. and affiliates for the design, production, sale and
    distribution of prescription frames and sunglasses under the

Polo Ralph Lauren

brand (the “Eyewear Licensing
    Agreement”).

The Eyewear Licensing Agreement took effect on January 1,
    2007 after the Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement
    with another licensee expired. In early January, the Company
    received a prepayment of approximately $180 million, net of
    certain tax withholdings, in consideration of the annual minimum
    royalty and design-services fees to be earned over the life of
    the contract. The prepayment is non-refundable, except with
    respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the Company, in
    which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment as
    determined based on the specific terms of the agreement would be
    required to be repaid. The prepayment was recorded by the
    Company as deferred income and is being recognized in earnings
    as earned in accordance with the terms of the agreement based
    upon the higher of (a) contractually guaranteed minimum
    royalty levels or (b) estimates of sales and royalty data
    received from the licensee.

Underwear
    Licensing Agreement

The Company licensed the right to manufacture and sell
    Chaps-branded underwear under a long-term license agreement,
    which was scheduled to expire in December 2009. During Fiscal
    2007, the Company and the licensee agreed to terminate the
    licensing and related design-services agreements. In connection
    with this agreement, the Company received a portion of the
    minimum royalty and design-service fees due to it under the
    underlying agreements on an accelerated basis. The approximate
    $8 million of proceeds received by the Company has been
    recognized as licensing revenue in the consolidated financial
    statements for Fiscal 2007.

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of March 29, 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the two fiscal years in the
    period ended March 29, 2008. These financial statements are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a

    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company as of March 29, 2008, and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the two fiscal years
    in the period ended March 29, 2008, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

As discussed in Note 3 to the notes to consolidated
    financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes”, effective April 1, 2007.
    Also, as discussed in Note 4 to the notes to consolidated
    financial statements, the Company elected application of Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and
    subsidiaries’ (the “Company’s”) internal
    control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2009,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
    criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of March 28, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 28,
    2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the fiscal year
    then ended and our report dated May 26, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

Net income and net income per

    affected by approximately $69 million of pretax charges
    related to asset impairments and restructurings.

(b)

Per common share amounts for the
    quarters and full years have been calculated separately.
    Accordingly, quarterly amounts may not add to the annual amount
    because of differences in the average common shares outstanding
    during each period.
