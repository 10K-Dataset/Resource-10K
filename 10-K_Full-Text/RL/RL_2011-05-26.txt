PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

Founded in 1967 by Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the
    design, marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle
    products, including men’s, women’s and children’s
    apparel, accessories (including footwear), fragrances and home
    furnishings. We believe that our global reach, breadth of
    product and multi-channel distribution is unique among luxury
    and apparel companies. We operate in three distinct but
    integrated segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.

The tables below show our net revenues and operating profit
    (excluding unallocated corporate expenses and legal and
    restructuring charges) by segment for the last three fiscal

Over the past five fiscal years, our sales have grown to
    $5.660 billion in Fiscal 2011 from $4.295 billion in
    Fiscal 2007. This growth has been largely a result of both our
    acquisitions and organic growth. We have diversified our
    business by channels of distribution, price point and target
    consumer, as well as by geography. Our global reach is
    extensive, with Ralph Lauren-branded merchandise available
    through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately
    10,000 different retail locations worldwide. In addition to our
    wholesale distribution, we sell directly to customers throughout
    the world via 367 full-price and factory retail stores, 510
    concessions-based shop-within-shops and our

e-commerce

websites, RalphLauren.com, Rugby.com, and our recently launched
    United Kingdom

e-commerce

site located at www.RalphLauren.co.uk.

We continue to invest in our business. In the past five fiscal
    years, we have invested approximately $1.555 billion for
    acquisitions and capital improvements, primarily funded through
    strong operating cash flow. We intend to continue to execute our
    long-term strategy, which includes expanding our presence
    internationally, extending our

direct-to-consumer

reach, expanding our accessories and other product offerings,
    and investing in our operational infrastructure. See
    Item 7 —

“Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Overview

—

Our
    Objectives and Risks”

for further discussion of our
    long-term strategy.

We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding
    of our Company. As of April 2, 2011, Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    or entities controlled by the Lauren family, owned approximately
    76% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the
    Company.

Seasonality
    of Business

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with
    higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth
    quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third
    quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of
    seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel,

back-to-school

and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment. As a result
    of the growth and other changes in our business, along with
    changes in consumer spending patterns and the macroeconomic
    environment, historical quarterly operating trends and working
    capital requirements may not be indicative of future
    performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating
    income and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by,
    among other things, the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments
    and other events affecting retail sales.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working
    capital typically increases during the first half of the fiscal
    year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling
    periods and, accordingly, typically decreases during the second
    half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash
    provided by operating activities is typically higher in the
    second half of the fiscal year due to higher net income and
    reduced working capital requirements during that period.



Recent
    Developments

Greater
    China Restructuring Plan

In May 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to reposition our
    existing distribution network in the Greater China region, which
    is comprised of Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
    This plan is expected to be carried out primarily in Fiscal 2012
    and include a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain
    retail stores and concession shops that do not support the new
    merchandising strategy. Actions related to the restructuring
    plan are anticipated to result in pretax charges of
    approximately $10 million to $20 million in Fiscal
    2012.

Japan
    Earthquake

On March 11, 2011, the northern region of Japan experienced
    a severe earthquake followed by a series of tsunamis that
    resulted in a significant disruption in economic conditions. In
    addition to the negative direct effects to the Japanese economy,
    the country’s position as a major exporter in the world may
    result in a regional or global downturn in economic activity.
    While the degree to which recent events in Japan will affect the
    global economy remains uncertain at this time, the impact is
    expected to have a negative effect on the sales and operating
    margins of our Japanese operations in Fiscal 2012.

South
    Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition

On January 1, 2011, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel and accessories business in South Korea
    (the “Polo South Korea Business”) from a licensed to a
    wholly owned operation, we acquired certain net assets
    (including inventory) and employees from Doosan Corporation
    (“Doosan”) in exchange for an initial payment of
    approximately $25 million plus an additional aggregate
    payment of approximately $22 million (the “South Korea
    Licensed Operations Acquisition”). Doosan was our licensee
    for the Polo South Korea business. We funded the South Korea
    Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash on-hand. In
    conjunction with the South Korea Licensed Operations
    Acquisition, we also entered into a transition services
    agreement with Doosan for the provision of certain financial and
    information systems services for a period of up to twelve months
    commencing on January 1, 2011.

The operating results for the Polo South Korea business have
    been consolidated in our operating results commencing
    January 1, 2011 and are reported on a one-month lag. The
    net effect of this reporting lag is not deemed to be material to
    our consolidated financial statements.

Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition

On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel business in Asia-Pacific (excluding
    Japan and South Korea) from a licensed to a wholly owned
    operation, we acquired certain net assets from Dickson Concepts
    International Limited and affiliates (“Dickson”) in
    exchange for an initial payment of approximately
    $20 million and other consideration of approximately
    $17 million (the “Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition”). Dickson was our licensee for Polo-branded
    apparel in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan and South
    Korea), which is comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
    Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. We
    funded the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition with
    available cash on-hand.

The operating results for the Polo-branded apparel business in
    Asia-Pacific have been consolidated in our operating results
    commencing January 1, 2010.

Our
    Wholesale Segment

Our Wholesale segment sells our products to leading upscale and
    certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores and golf
    and pro shops, both domestically and internationally. We have
    continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store
    product assortment and presentation, and improving full-price
    sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2011, our
    Ralph Lauren-branded products were sold through approximately
    10,000 doors worldwide and during Fiscal 2011, we invested
    approximately $35 million in related shop-within-shops
    primarily in domestic and international department and specialty
    stores.

Department stores are our major wholesale customers in North
    America. In Europe, our wholesale sales are a varying mix of
    sales to both department stores and specialty shops, depending
    on the country. Our collection brands — Women’s
    Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label and Men’s Purple
    Label and Black Label — are distributed through a
    limited number of premier fashion retailers. In addition, we
    sell excess and

out-of-season

products through secondary distribution channels, including our
    retail factory stores. In Japan, our wholesale products are
    distributed primarily through shop-within-shops at premiere and
    top-tier department stores, and the mix of business is weighted
    to Women’s Blue Label. In Asia (excluding Japan and South
    Korea), our wholesale products are sold at mid and top-tier
    department stores, and the mix of business is primarily weighted
    to Men’s and Women’s Blue Label. In Asia and on a
    worldwide basis, products distributed through concessions-based
    sales arrangements are reported within our Retail segment (see

“Our Retail Segment”

for further discussion).

    New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in
    Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, Paris, London, Munich, Madrid,
    Stockholm and Tokyo.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical
    element of our distribution to department stores, we and our
    licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand
    recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines
    by the department stores and to differentiate the presentation
    of products. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include
    items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and
    components, decorative items and flooring.

As of April 2, 2011, we had approximately 16,000
    shop-within-shops dedicated to our Ralph Lauren-branded
    wholesale products worldwide. The size of our shop-within-shops
    typically ranges from approximately 300 to 6,000 square
    feet. We normally share in the cost of these shop-within-shops
    with our wholesale customers.

Basic Stock Replenishment
    Program.

Basic products such as knit shirts,
    chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered at any time
    through our basic stock replenishment programs. We generally
    ship these products within

two-to-five

days of order receipt.

Our
    Retail Segment

    full-price retail stores and 191 factory stores worldwide,
    totaling approximately 2.8 million gross square feet, 510

websites. The extension of our

direct-to-consumer

reach is a primary long-term strategic goal.

Full-Price
    Retail Stores

    distinct sensibility of our brands and feature exclusive lines
    that are not sold in domestic department stores. We opened 8 new
    full-price stores, acquired 2 previously licensed stores, and
    closed 15 full-price stores in Fiscal 2011. In addition, we

Our
    Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight,
    design, and marketing skills with the specific product or
    geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and
    build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners
    who:

•

are leaders in their respective markets;

•

contribute the majority of the product development costs;

•

provide the operational infrastructure required to support the
    business; and

•

own the inventory.

We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell
    at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more
    of our trademarks. We grant our international geographic area
    licensing partners exclusive rights to distribute certain brands
    or classes of our products and operate retail stores in specific
    international territories. These geographic area licensees
    source products from us, our product licensing partners and
    independent sources. Each licensing partner pays us royalties
    based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a
    minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks
    and design services. In addition, licensing partners may be
    required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertise
    our products and share in the creative costs associated with
    these products. Larger allocations are required in connection
    with launches of new products or in new territories. Our
    licenses generally have one to five-year terms and may grant the
    licensee conditional renewal options.

We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that their
    products are developed, marketed and distributed so as to reach
    the intended market opportunity and to present consistently to
    consumers worldwide the distinctive perspective and lifestyle
    associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design,
    production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution,
    advertising and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject
    to our prior approval and continuing oversight. The result is a
    consistent identity for Ralph Lauren products across product
    categories and international markets.

Approximately 40% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2011 was
    derived from four licensing partners: Luxottica Group, S.p.A.
    (12%), Peerless, Inc. (10%), The Warnaco Group, Inc. (9%) and
    L’Oreal S.A. (9%).

International
    Licenses

We believe that international markets offer additional
    opportunities for our quintessential American designs and
    lifestyle image. We work with our international licensing
    partners to facilitate international growth in their respective
    territories. International expansion/growth opportunities may
    include:

•

the roll out of new products and brands following their launch
    in the U.S.;

•

the introduction of additional product lines;

•

the entrance into new international markets;

•

the addition of Ralph Lauren or Polo Ralph Lauren stores in
    these markets; and

•

the expansion and upgrade of shop-within-shop networks in these
    markets.

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell,
    promote, market

and/or

distribute various categories of our products in a given
    geographic area. These rights may include the right to own and
    operate retail stores. The economic arrangements are similar to
    those of our product licensing partners. We design licensed
    products either alone or in collaboration with our domestic
    licensing partners. Our product licensees, whose territories do
    not include the international geographic area licensees’
    territories, generally provide our international licensing
    partners with product or patterns, piece goods, manufacturing
    locations and other information and assistance necessary to
    achieve product uniformity, for which they are often compensated
    by these partners.

As of April 2, 2011, our international licensing partners
    operated 57 Ralph Lauren stores, 48 Ralph Lauren concession
    shops and 56 Club Monaco stores and dedicated shops.

Ralph
    Lauren Home

Together with our licensing partners, we offer an extensive
    collection of home products that draw upon and further the
    design themes of our other product lines, contributing to our
    complete lifestyle concept. Products are sold under the

Ralph
    Lauren Home

,

Lauren by Ralph Lauren

,

Chaps

and

American Living

brands in three primary



categories: bedding and bath, home décor and home
    improvement. As of April 2, 2011, we had agreements with
    thirteen domestic and two international home product licensing
    partners, and one international home product sublicensing
    partner.

We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home
    licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners.
    These services include design, operating showrooms, marketing,
    advertising and, in some cases, sales. In general, the licensing
    partners manufacture and own the inventory, and ship the
    products. Our Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances generally
    have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the upper tiers of
    their respective markets and are offered at a range of price
    levels. These products are generally distributed through several
    channels of distribution, including department stores, specialty
    home furnishings stores, interior design showrooms, customer
    direct mail catalogs, home centers and the Internet, as well as
    our own stores and

e-commerce

websites. As with our other products, the use of
    shop-within-shops is central to our department store
    distribution strategy.

Product
    Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of
    American style with a strong international appeal. Our
    consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an
    important contributor to the prominence, strength and reputation
    of the Ralph Lauren brands.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the
    direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which
    is divided into nine departments: Menswear, Women’s
    Collection, Women’s Ready to Wear, Dresses,
    Children’s, Accessories (including footwear), Home, Club
    Monaco and Rugby. We form design teams around our brands and
    product categories to develop concepts, themes and products for
    each brand and category. Through close collaboration with
    merchandising, sales and production staff, these teams support
    all three segments of our business — Wholesale, Retail
    and Licensing — in order to gain market and other
    valuable input.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing program communicates the themes and images of our
    brands and is an integral feature of our product offering.
    Worldwide marketing is managed on a centralized basis through
    our advertising and public relations departments in order to
    ensure consistency of presentation.



We create distinctive image advertising for all of our brands,
    conveying the particular message of each one within the context
    of the overall Ralph Lauren aesthetic. Advertisements generally
    portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a
    variety of products offered by ourselves and, in some cases, our
    licensing partners. Our primary advertising medium is print,
    with multiple page advertisements appearing regularly in a range
    of fashion, lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major
    print advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and
    spring retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to
    coincide with product deliveries. In addition to print, some
    brands have utilized television and outdoor media in their
    marketing programs. Our

e-commerce

websites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle on the Internet
    while offering the full breadth of our apparel, accessories and
    home products.

We advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate
    in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of
    our retailer partners. In addition, we provide

point-of-sale

fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the
    presentation of our products at retail locations. We expensed
    approximately $192 million related to the advertising of
    our products in Fiscal 2011.

When our domestic licensing partners are required to spend an
    amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on
    advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their
    behalf.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each
    of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at
    major fashion shows in New York City, which typically generate
    extensive domestic and international media coverage. We
    introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at
    press presentations in major cities such as New York and Milan,
    Italy. In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our
    models, certain professional athletes and sponsors. We are the
    first exclusive outfitter for all on-court officials at the
    Wimbledon tennis tournament and are currently the official
    outfitter of all on-court officials at the U.S. Open tennis
    tournament. We are also the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter
    for the 2012 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams and have the
    right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote and sell
    products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits and
    associated leisure wear.

In January 2011, we entered into a five-year agreement with the
    United States Golf Association (“USGA”) to be the
    official apparel outfitter for the USGA and the U.S. Open
    Championships and will serve as the championship’s largest

on-site

apparel supplier.

Sourcing,
    Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own
    or operate any production facilities. Over 400 different
    manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear and
    accessories products, with no one manufacturer providing more
    than 8% of our total production during Fiscal 2011. We source
    both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include
    fabric, buttons and other trim. Finished products consist of
    manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to
    our customers. In Fiscal 2011, less than 2%, by dollar volume,
    of our products were produced in the U.S., and over 98%, by
    dollar volume, were produced outside the U.S., primarily in
    Asia, Europe and South America. See

“Import Restrictions
    and other Government Regulations”

and
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business — Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.”

Most of the businesses in our Wholesale segment must commit to
    manufacture our garments before we receive customer orders. We
    also must commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance
    of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers’
    demand for a particular product or the need for a particular
    fabric or yarn, we may sell the excess products or garments made
    from such fabric or yarn in our factory stores or through
    secondary distribution channels.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global
    manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia,
    the Americas and Europe. All garments are produced according to
    our specifications. Production and quality control staff in
    Asia, the Americas and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier
    facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the
    final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor
    certification and compliance programs, so that quality assurance
    is focused upon as early as possible in the production process,
    allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution
    facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.



Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and
    consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with
    numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic and foreign.
    Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
    substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on
    the basis of fashion, quality and service, which depend on our
    ability to:

•

anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely
    manner;

•

maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

develop and produce high quality products that appeal to
    consumers;

•

appropriately price our products;

•

provide strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensure product availability; and

•

obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present our
    products at retail.

See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors —
    Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete —
    We face intense competition in the worldwide apparel
    industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution in the U.S., Ralph Lauren products
    are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution
    centers for inspection, sorting, packing, and delivery to retail
    and wholesale customers. This network includes our owned
    distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina, two leased
    facilities in High Point, North Carolina, and third party
    logistics centers in Chino Hills, California and Miami, Florida.
    All facilities are designed to allow for high density cube
    storage and value added services, and utilize unit and carton
    tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory
    management. Canadian distribution to Club Monaco stores is
    supported by a third party logistics provider in Toronto,
    Ontario. European distribution is serviced by a third party
    facility located in Parma, Italy. Japanese distribution has
    historically been serviced by third party facilities located in
    Kawasaki and Ebina, and is in the process of being transitioned
    to a new third party facility located in Yokohama. South Korean
    distribution is serviced by a leased facility in Gasan.
    Excluding Japan and South Korea, distribution in Asia is
    serviced by a third party facility in Hong Kong, supported by
    third party locations in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan.
    South American distribution is serviced by third party
    facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay.
    The distribution network is managed through globally integrated
    information technology systems.

RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com customer order fulfillment is
    performed at a leased facility in High Point, North Carolina.
    Customer order fulfillment for RalphLauren.co.uk, our newly
    launched United Kingdom retail

e-commerce

site, is performed at a third party fulfillment center in Parma,
    Italy.

Management
    Information Systems

Our management information systems make the design, marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution of our products more
    efficient by providing, among other things:

•

comprehensive order processing;

•

production and design information;

•

accounting information; and

•

an enterprise view of information for our design, marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution functions.



The

point-of-sale

registers in conjunction with other systems in our stores enable
    us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a
    real-time basis. We believe our merchandising and financial
    systems, coupled with our

point-of-sale

registers and software programs, allow for stock replenishment,
    effective merchandise planning and real-time inventory
    accounting. See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business —
    Certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters and accounting
    changes could adversely impact our results of
    operations.”

In the U.S., we utilize an automated replenishment system,
    Logility, to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment
    orders from our Retail segment and wholesale customers, the
    movement of goods through distribution channels, and the
    collection of information for planning and forecasting. We have
    a collaborative relationship with many of our suppliers that
    enables us to reduce

cash-to-cash

cycles in the management of our inventory.

We are in the process of implementing a new global financial and
    reporting system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and
    upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes. The
    implementation of this global system is scheduled to occur in
    phases over the next several years, and began with the migration
    of certain of our domestic human resource systems to the new
    system during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.

See Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our Business

—

Our business could suffer if our computer
    systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate
    effectively.”

Wholesale
    Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise
    principally to major department stores and extend credit based
    on an evaluation of the customer’s financial capacity and
    condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor
    credit levels and the financial condition of our customers on a
    continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or
    underwrite our accounts receivables, or maintain credit
    insurance to manage the risks of bad debts. Collection and
    deduction transactional activities are principally provided
    through a third party service provider. See
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors — Risks
    Related to Our Business

—

Our business could be
    negatively impacted by any financial instability of our
    customers.”

Wholesale
    Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products
    approximately three to five months prior to the time the
    products are delivered to stores. Such orders are generally
    subject to broad cancellation rights. As of April 2, 2011,
    our total backlog was $1.391 billion, compared to
    $1.160 billion as of April 3, 2010. We expect that
    substantially all of our backlog orders as of April 2, 2011
    will be filled within the next fiscal year. The size of our
    order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the
    timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which
    a significant percentage of our orders are received, and the
    timing of shipments. As a consequence, a comparison of the size
    of our order backlog from period to period may not be
    necessarily meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual
    shipments.

Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph Lauren,”
    “Polo by Ralph Lauren Design” and the famous polo
    player astride a horse trademarks in the U.S. and
    approximately 100 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we
    similarly own include:

•

“Lauren Ralph Lauren”;

•

“Lauren”;

•

“Purple Label”;

•

“Blue Label”;

•

“Black Label”;



•

“Pink Pony”;

•

“Ralph”;

•

“RRL”;

•

“Club Monaco”;

•

“Rugby”;

•

“RLX”;

•

“Chaps”;

•

“American Living”; and

•

Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.

Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as
    trademarks “Ralph Lauren,” “Double RL” and
    “RRL” in perpetuity in connection with, among other
    things, beef and living animals. The trademarks “Double
    RL” and “RRL” are currently used by the Double RL
    Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. In addition,
    Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects
    involving film or theatrical productions (not including or
    relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a
    company wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these
    companies has no impact on us.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations and pending
    applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items
    of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings,
    restaurant and café services, online services and online
    publications and beauty products, as well as in connection with
    retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage
    and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks
    remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in
    connection with the related products and services and the
    required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license
    to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to
    the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our
    products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect
    them against infringement (see Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion). As
    a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been
    the object of counterfeiting. We have a broad enforcement
    program which has been generally effective in controlling the
    sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major
    markets abroad.

In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our
    trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our
    international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with
    various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in
    certain trademarks, including “Polo”

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, which impede
    our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such
    conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we
    continue our international expansion, we have, in general,
    successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both
    legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners
    of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A —

“Risk Factors

—

Risks Related to Our
    Business

—

Our trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected
    outside the U.S.”

and Item 3
    —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further
    discussion). Although we have not in the past suffered any
    material restraints or restrictions on doing business in
    desirable markets, we cannot assure that significant impediments
    will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and
    introduce trademarks to new markets.

Import
    Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the U.S., Canada,
    Europe, and Asia is subject to duties. In addition, most of the
    countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and
    duties to protect their local industries from import surges that
    threaten to create market disruption. In this regard, effective
    July 21, 2011, safeguard duties will be imposed by Turkey
    on imports of textiles and apparel from certain countries. The
    U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose
    additional duties in response to a particular product being
    imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded
    prices that in such increased quantities as to cause (or
    threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally
    known as “anti-dumping” actions). Canada currently has
    an anti-



dumping order on waterproof footwear under consideration. If
    dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. Government may
    self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile
    industry which could significantly affect our costs.
    Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as
    countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the
    U.S. Government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign
    government to foreign manufactures if the importation of such
    subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a
    U.S. industry. Recent developments have now made it
    possible to impose countervailing duties on products from
    non-market economies, such as China, which could significantly
    increase our costs.

We are also subject to other international trade agreements and
    regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,
    the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean
    Basin Initiative. In addition, each of the countries in which
    our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports.
    Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our
    products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time,
    impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls
    or restrictions, including the imposition of “safeguard
    quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates
    or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of
    import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our
    potential exposure to import related risks through, among other
    measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts
    of production among countries and manufacturers, as well as
    through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all our products are manufactured by foreign
    suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the
    administration of current international trade regulations,
    executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in
    sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quota could
    adversely affect our operations. Although we generally expect
    that the 2005 elimination of quotas will result, over the long
    term, in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced
    abroad, the implementation of any “safeguard quota
    provisions” or any “anti-dumping” or
    “countervailing duty” actions may result, over the
    near term, in cost increases and in disruption of the supply
    chain for certain products categories. See
    Item 1A —

“Risk Factors — Risks
    Related to Our Business — Our business is subject to
    risks associated with importing products”

and

“Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
    Business — Our ability to conduct business in
    international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory,
    political and economic risks.”

Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to
    regulation in the U.S. and other countries by other
    governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade
    Commission, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer
    Products Safety Commission, including the Consumer Product
    Safety Improvement Act, which imposes new limitations on the
    permissible amounts of lead and phthalates allowed in
    children’s products. These regulations relate principally
    to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability
    testing, and product safety particularly with respect to
    products used by children. We believe that we are in substantial
    compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable
    federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations
    governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the
    environment. We do not estimate any significant capital
    expenditures for environmental control matters either in the
    current fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products
    and licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our
    agreements require our licensing partners to operate in
    compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are not aware
    of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a
    material adverse effect on our business or operating results.

Although we have not suffered any material restriction from
    doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot
    assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future
    as we expand product offerings and introduce additional
    trademarks to new markets.

Employees

As of April 2, 2011, we had approximately
    24,000 employees, both full and part-time, consisting of
    approximately 16,000 in the U.S. and approximately 8,000 in
    foreign countries. Approximately 30 of our U.S. production
    and distribution employees in the womenswear business are
    members of UNITE HERE (which was previously known as the Union
    of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, prior to its
    merger with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
    International Union) under an industry association collective
    bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has
    adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and
    non-union employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
    The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking
    statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
    business, our prospects, our results of operations, our
    financial condition, our liquidity, the trading prices of our
    securities, and the actual outcome of matters as to which
    forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional
    risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are
    immaterial may also affect our business operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The loss
    of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or other key personnel
    could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing
    and operational areas of our business has been a critical
    element of our success since the inception of our Company. The
    death or disability of Mr. Lauren or other extended or
    permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or
    industry perception with respect to him or arising from his
    loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our
    other executive officers and other members of senior management
    have substantial experience and expertise in our business and
    have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
    The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these
    individuals could also have a material adverse effect on us. We
    are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar
    life insurance covering Mr. Lauren, our other executive
    officers and certain other members of senior management. We have
    entered into employment agreements with Mr. Lauren and our
    other executive officers, but the noncompete period with respect
    to Mr. Lauren and certain other executive officers could,
    in some circumstances in the event of their termination of
    employment with our Company, end prior to the employment term
    set forth in their employment agreements.

Our
    business could be negatively impacted by any financial
    instability of our customers.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department
    stores across the U.S., Europe and Asia and extend credit based
    on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial
    difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or
    eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more
    credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables. In the
    aggregate, our four largest wholesale customers constituted
    approximately 30% of our gross trade accounts receivable
    outstanding as of April 2, 2011 and contributed
    approximately 40% of all wholesale revenues for Fiscal 2011. Our
    inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any
    one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition or liquidity. See
    Item 1 —

“Business — Wholesale
    Credit Control.”

Uncertain
    economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major
    customers and suppliers which in turn could materially adversely
    affect our operating results and liquidity.

The uncertain state of the global economy is having a
    significant negative impact on businesses around the world.
    Although we believe that our cash provided by operations and
    available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility
    will provide us with sufficient liquidity through the current
    economic uncertainty, the impact of economic conditions on our
    major customers and suppliers cannot be predicted and may be
    quite severe. The inability of major manufacturers to ship our
    products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date
    requirements of our customers. A disruption in the ability of
    our significant customers to access liquidity could cause
    serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their
    businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their
    future orders of our products and the inability or failure on
    their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which
    could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
    and liquidity.

We cannot
    assure the successful implementation of our growth
    strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands,
    expand our geographic coverage and increase direct management of
    our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically
    acquiring or integrating select businesses previously held by
    our licensees and enhancing our operations. Implementation of
    our strategy involves



the continued expansion of our business in Europe, Asia and
    other international areas. As discussed in
    Item 1 —

“Business — Recent
    Developments,”

on January 1, 2011, we acquired our
    previously licensed Polo-branded apparel and accessories
    business in South Korea. In Fiscal 2010, we acquired our
    previously licensed Polo-branded apparel business in the
    Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan and South Korea). In Fiscal
    2009, we acquired our previously licensed childrenswear and golf
    apparel businesses in Japan.

We may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our
    operations, hiring and retaining qualified key employees, or
    otherwise successfully managing such expansion. Furthermore, we
    may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any
    licensee that we acquire into our own business or achieve any
    expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.

Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation
    and expansion of our retail distribution network, both in the
    U.S. and abroad, which are subject to many factors beyond
    our control. We may not be able to procure, purchase or lease
    desirable free-standing or department store locations, or renew
    and maintain existing free-standing store leases and department
    store locations on acceptable terms, or secure suitable
    replacement locations. The lease negotiation as well as the
    number and timing of new stores actually opened during any given
    period, and their associated contribution to net income for the
    period, depends on a number of factors including, but not
    limited to: (i) the availability of suitable financing to
    us and our landlords; (ii) the timing of the delivery of
    the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to
    commence build-out construction activities; (iii) our
    ability and our landlords’ ability to obtain all necessary
    governmental licenses and permits to construct and operate our
    stores on a timely basis; (iv) our ability to manage the
    construction and development costs of new stores; (v) the
    rectification of any unforeseen engineering or environmental
    problems with the leased premises; (vi) adverse weather
    during the construction period; and (vii) the hiring and
    training of qualified operating personnel in the local market.
    While we continue to explore new markets and are always
    evaluating new potential locations, any of the above factors
    could have an adverse impact on our financial operations.

In Europe, we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we
    have in the U.S., and we may have difficulty developing
    successful distribution strategies and alliances in each of the
    major European countries. In Asia (including Japan), our primary
    mode of distribution is via a network of shops located within
    leading department stores. We may have difficulty in
    successfully retaining this network, and expanding into
    alternate distribution channels. Additionally, macroeconomic
    trends may not be favorable, and could limit our ability to
    implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we
    have foreign operations, such as Europe and Asia.

Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.

As of April 2, 2011, we source a significant portion of our
    products outside the U.S. through arrangements with over
    400 foreign vendors in various countries. In Fiscal 2011, over
    98%, by dollar value, of our products were produced outside the
    U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. Risks
    inherent in importing our products include:

•

changes in social, political and economic conditions or
    terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from
    the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are
    located;

•

the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or
    exports;

•

the imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports or exports;

•

significant fluctuations of the cost of raw materials;

•

increases in the cost of fuel, travel and transportation;

•

disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by
    natural and man-made disasters;

•

significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security
    considerations;

•

the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings
    resulting in the potential assessment of special antidumping or
    countervailing duties; and

•

the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties
    either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy
    perceived illegal actions by national governments.



Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
    profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on
    margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure
    caused by many factors, including intense competition,
    consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to
    reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending
    patterns. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices
    to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin
    to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory
    levels

and/or

otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in
    our operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to
    sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our
    profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Our
    business could suffer as a result of increases in the price of
    raw materials, freight or labor or a manufacturer’s
    inability to produce our goods on time and to our
    specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend
    exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of
    all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our
    specifications primarily by international manufacturers. During
    Fiscal 2011, less than 2%, by dollar value, of our men’s
    and women’s products were manufactured in the U.S. and
    over 98%, by dollar value, of these products were manufactured
    in other countries. The inability of a manufacturer to ship
    orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality
    standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements
    of our customers for those items, which could result in
    cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a
    substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations. Additionally, prices of raw materials
    used to manufacture our products may fluctuate and increases in
    prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse
    effect on our cost of sales. Furthermore, the cost of labor at
    many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing
    significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries
    continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will
    abate. The cost of transportation has been increasing as well
    and it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate if oil
    prices continue to increase and there is continued significant
    unrest in the Middle East. We may not be able to offset such
    increases in raw materials, freight or labor costs through
    pricing actions or other means.

Our
    business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency
    fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars.
    However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result,
    the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the
    value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
    rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
    currency denominated prices at which our international
    businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales
    and licensing revenue generally is derived from sales in foreign
    currencies. These foreign currencies primarily include the
    Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Euro and the British
    Pound Sterling, and this revenue could be materially affected by
    currency fluctuations. Although we hedge certain exposures to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the
    ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that foreign
    currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations. See
    Item 7 —

“Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

—

Market Risk Management.”

Fluctuations
    in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in
    volatility of our operating results and stock price.

We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain
    foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our
    estimates of future payments, which include reserves for
    uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any
    one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various
    taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and
    negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate
    settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that
    throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our
    quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated.
    In addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial
    statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the
    mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to
    existing accounting rules or regulations.



Our
    Company has an exclusive relationship with certain customers for
    some of our products. The loss or significant decline in
    business of any of these customers could negatively impact our
    business.

We have exclusive relationships with certain customers for
    distribution of some of our products, including our

American
    Living

and

Chaps

products. Our arrangements with
    JCPenney and Kohl’s for the

American Living

and

Chaps

products, respectively, make us dependent on the
    financial and operational health of those companies.
    Additionally, the loss of either of these relationships could
    have an adverse effect on our Wholesale business.

Our
    business could suffer as a result of consolidations,
    liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the
    retail industry.

Several of our department store customers, including some under
    common ownership, account for significant portions of our
    wholesale net sales. A substantial portion of sales of our
    licensed products by our domestic licensing partners, including
    sales made by our sales force of Ralph Lauren Home products, are
    also made to our largest department store customers. In the
    aggregate, our four largest wholesale customers accounted for
    approximately 40% of our wholesale net sales during Fiscal 2011.
    There can be no assurance that consolidations, restructurings,
    reorganizations or other ownership changes in the department
    store sector will not have a material adverse effect on our
    wholesale business.

We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
    commitments with our customers for each of our lines every
    season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores
    or any other significant customer, whether motivated by
    competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
    decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from
    us or our licensing partners; or to change their manner of doing
    business with us or our licensing partners or their new
    strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued
    focus on further development of their “private label”
    initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business or financial condition.

Certain
    legal proceedings, regulatory matters and accounting changes
    could adversely impact our results of operations.

We are involved in certain legal proceedings and are subject
    from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of
    contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims,
    credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail
    store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters
    and other litigations. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if
    decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in
    material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on
    our reputation or relations with our employees, customers,
    licensees or other third parties. In addition, regardless of the
    outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such
    proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require
    that our Company devotes substantial time and resources to
    defend itself. Further, changes in governmental regulations both
    in the U.S., including potential changes in state laws regarding
    the escheatment of unredeemed gift cards, and in other countries
    where we conduct business operations could have an adverse
    impact on our results of operations. See Item 3 —
    “Legal Proceedings” for further discussion of our
    Company’s legal matters.

In addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and
    interpretations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board is
    currently in the process of amending a number of existing
    accounting standards governing a variety of areas. Certain of
    these proposed standards, particularly the proposed standard
    governing accounting for leases, if and when effective, would
    likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements. See Note 4 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion of
    proposed amendments to current accounting standards.

Our
    business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are
    disrupted or cease to operate effectively.

Our Company relies heavily on our computer systems to record and
    process transactions and manage and operate our business. We
    also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the
    processing of basic replenishment orders from our Retail segment
    and our wholesale customers, the movement of goods through
    distribution channels, and the collection of information for
    planning and forecasting. In addition, we have



e-commerce

and other Internet websites in the U.S. and U.K. Given the
    complexity of our business and the significant number of
    transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is
    imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer
    hardware and software systems. Despite our preventative efforts,
    our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or
    interruption from, among other things, security breaches,
    computer viruses or power outages.

We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems
    and software. We are in the process of implementing a new global
    financial and reporting system as part of a multi-year plan to
    integrate and upgrade our operational and financial systems and
    processes. The implementation of this global system is scheduled
    to occur in phases over the next several years, and began with
    the migration of certain of our domestic human resource systems
    to the new global financial and reporting system during the
    fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011. This implementation effort will
    continue in the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, when certain of
    our domestic operational and financial systems will be
    transitioned to the new system. Implementation of a new global
    financial and reporting system involves risks and uncertainties.
    Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design or
    implementation of the new system could result in increased costs
    and adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial
    results, which could negatively impact our business and results
    of operations.

A privacy
    breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with
    our customers, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect
    our business.

As part of our normal course of business, we collect, process
    and retain sensitive and confidential customer information.
    Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities
    and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may
    be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer
    viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming

and/or

human
    errors, or other similar events. Any security breach involving
    the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of
    confidential information, whether by our Company or our vendors,
    could severely damage our reputation and our relationships with
    our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability
    and adversely affect our business.

Our
    ability to conduct business in international markets may be
    affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
    risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets
    and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing
    international markets is subject to risks associated with
    international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.

We are also subject to general political and economic risks in
    connection with our international operations, including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other
    similar restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European
    Union, Asia, or other countries upon the import or export of our
    products in the future, or what effect any of these actions
    would have on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social or
    economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse
    effect on our business in the future or may require us to
    significantly modify our current business practices.



Our
    results of operations could be affected by natural events in the
    locations in which we or our customers or suppliers
    operate.

We have operations, including retail, distribution and
    warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural
    disasters such as severe weather and geological events that
    could disrupt our operations. In addition, our suppliers and
    customers also have operations in these locations. Such an event
    occurred in Japan on March 11, 2011, where the northern
    region of Japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a
    series of tsunamis, resulting in damage to the region’s
    industrial infrastructure and environmental pollution. In
    addition to the negative direct effects to the Japanese economy,
    the country’s position as a major exporter in the world may
    result in a regional or global downturn in economic activity.
    The degree to which the earthquake in Japan will have an
    economic disruption on the regional and global economies remains
    uncertain at this time; however, the impact may result in a
    decrease in the demand for our products that could have an
    adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our
    trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
    adequately protected outside the U.S.

We believe that our trademarks, intellectual property and other
    proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and
    our competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the
    establishment and protection of our trademarks and
    anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. Significant
    counterfeiting of our products continues, however, and in the
    course of our international expansion we have experienced
    conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or
    claimed ownership rights in some trademarks that include Polo

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise
    have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past
    resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action
    and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken
    to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary
    rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material
    adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation
    of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and
    proprietary rights of others. Also, there can be no assurance
    that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of,
    trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will
    be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
    satisfaction or at all. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
    countries do not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights
    to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. See
    Item 1 —

“Business

—

Trademarks,”

and
    Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings.”

Our
    business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use
    acceptable labor practices.

We require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers
    to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote
    ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and
    monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do
    not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The
    violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer
    used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence
    of an independent manufacturer’s or licensing
    partner’s labor practices from those generally accepted as
    ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt, or
    otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or
    damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if we need to replace
    manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the production capacity of
    our manufacturers. Some of these competitors have greater
    financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an
    advantage in the competition for production. If we experience a
    significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
    of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party
    manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional
    capacity will be available when required on terms that are
    acceptable to us. See Item 1 —

“Business

—

Sourcing, Production and Quality.”

We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each
    season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design
    and quality specifications and other standard industry
    provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any
    manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our
    products exclusively.



We rely
    on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our
    licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our
    licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks
    specific to a licensing partner’s business, including, for
    example, risks associated with a particular licensing
    partner’s ability to:

•

obtain capital;

•

manage its labor relations;

•

maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively; and

•

maintain relationships with its customers.

Although a number of our license agreements prohibit licensing
    partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our
    competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded
    from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered
    by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of
    sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are
    also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
    control over our licensing partners’ products and
    advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other
    things, operational and financial control over their businesses.
    Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor
    execution or financial difficulties with respect to any of our
    licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Business

—

Our
    Licensing Segment.”

Failure
    to maintain licensing partners could harm our
    business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we could replace
    existing licensing partners if necessary, our inability to do so
    for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Business

—

Our
    Licensing Segment.”

The
    voting shares of our Company’s stock are concentrated in
    one majority stockholder.

As of April 2, 2011, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities
    controlled by the Lauren family, owned approximately 76% of the
    voting power of the outstanding common stock of our Company. As
    a result, Mr. Lauren has the ability to exercise
    significant control over our business, including, without
    limitation, (i) the election of our Class B common
    stock directors, voting separately as a class, and (ii) any
    action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the
    adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and
    the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of
    our assets.

The
    trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall
    based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other
    financial performance.

Our business planning process is designed to maximize our
    long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an
    earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe
    that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our
    Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we
    recognize that from time to time it may be helpful to provide
    investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast
    of net sales and earnings. While we generally expect to provide
    updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal
    quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our
    forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. If and
    when we announce actual results that differ from those that have
    been predicted by us, outside analysts or others, the market
    price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on
    the predictions when making investment decisions with respect to
    our securities do so at their own risk. We take no
    responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such
    changes in the prices of our securities.



Risks
    Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete

The
    downturn in the global economy may continue to affect consumer
    purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products,
    which could adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic
    factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer
    spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance, accessories and
    home products industries, including, among others:

•

general business conditions;

•

economic downturns;

•

employment levels;

•

downturns in the stock market;

•

interest rates;

•

the housing market;

•

consumer debt levels;

•

the availability of consumer credit;

•

increases in fuel prices;

•

taxation; and

•

consumer confidence in future economic conditions.

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail
    products, including our products, may continue to decline during
    recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income
    is lower. A downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in
    which we, or our licensing partners, sell our products may
    materially adversely affect our businesses and our revenues and
    profits. See Item 7 —

“Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Overview

—

Our
    Objectives and Risks”

for further discussion.

The domestic and international political situation also affects
    consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of
    terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to
    a decrease in consumer spending and may materially adversely
    affect our business, revenues and profits.

We face
    intense competition in the worldwide apparel industry.

We face a variety of intense competitive challenges from other
    domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual apparel
    producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more
    diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources
    than we have. We compete with these companies primarily on the
    basis of:

•

anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty and reputation
    for quality;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors
    and styles that appeal to consumers;

•

appropriately sourcing raw materials at cost-effective prices;

•

appropriately pricing products;

•

failure to anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;

•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain
    efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective
    presentation of our products at retail stores.



We also face increasing competition from companies selling
    apparel and home products through the Internet. Although we sell
    our products through the Internet, increased competition in the
    worldwide apparel, accessories and home product industries from
    Internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices and
    margins and adversely affect our results of operations.

The
    success of our business depends on our ability to respond to
    constantly changing fashion trends and consumer
    demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate
    and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as
    to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of
    consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with
    certainty and are subject to rapid change. We cannot assure that
    we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
    successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the
    future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or
    brands that we introduce will be successfully received by
    consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and
    respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion
    trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of
    our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold
    inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be
    forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of
    excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business and
    impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate
    consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to
    supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience
    inventory shortages, which may result in unfilled orders,
    negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty
    and result in lost revenues. See Item 1 —

“Business — Sourcing, Production and
    Quality.”

    for our distribution facility in Greensboro, North Carolina and
    a parcel of land adjacent to the facility, and retail stores in
    Southampton, New York and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

We believe that our existing facilities are well maintained, in
    good operating condition and are adequate for our present level
    of operations.

    leases, as well as those leases for our non-retail facilities,
    which expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or
    relocate to desirable locations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd.
    (“Wathne”), Polo’s then domestic licensee for
    luggage and handbags, filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York
    against our Company and Ralph Lauren, our Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, asserting, among other things, federal
    trademark law violations, breach of contract, breach of
    obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
    misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other relief,
    injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
    New York County, making substantially the same allegations
    and claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for breach of
    contract related claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. Following some discovery, we moved for
    summary judgment on the remaining claims. Wathne cross-moved for
    partial summary judgment. In an April 11, 2008 Decision and
    Order, the court granted Polo’s summary judgment motion to
    dismiss most of the claims against our Company, and denied
    Wathne’s cross-motion for summary judgment. Wathne appealed
    the dismissal of its claims to the Appellate Division of the
    Supreme Court. Following a hearing on May 19, 2009, the
    Appellate Division issued a Decision and Order on June 9,
    2009 which, in large part, affirmed the lower court’s
    ruling. Discovery on those claims that were not dismissed is
    ongoing and a trial date has not yet been set. We intend to
    continue to contest the remaining claims in this lawsuit
    vigorously. Management does not expect that the ultimate
    resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on
    our financial statements.



Other
    Matters

We are involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal
    claims and proceedings involving matters associated with or
    incidental to our business, including, among other things,
    matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other
    intellectual property, licensing, and employee relations. We
    believe that the resolution of currently pending matters will
    not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
    effect on our financial statements. However, our assessment of
    the current litigation or other legal claims could change in
    light of the discovery of facts not presently known or
    determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which
    are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the
    possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.

Since 2003, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend
    program on our common stock. On November 4, 2009, our Board
    of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly cash dividend
    on our common stock from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share. On
    February 8, 2011, our Board of Directors approved an
    additional increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common
    stock from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share. Approximately
    $48 million was recorded as a reduction to retained
    earnings during Fiscal 2011 in connection with our dividends.

As of May 20, 2011, there were 1,048 holders of record of
    our Class A common stock and 15 holders of record of our
    Class B common stock. All of our outstanding shares of
    Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and entities
    controlled by the Lauren family and are convertible at any time
    into shares of Class A common stock on a

one-for-one

basis. During Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, Mr. Lauren
    converted 11.3 million and 1.2 million shares of
    Class B common stock, respectively, into an equal number of
    shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the
    security.

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and
    distribution of premium lifestyle products including men’s,
    women’s and children’s apparel, accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishings. Our long-standing



reputation and distinctive image have been consistently
    developed across an expanding number of products, brands and
    international markets. Our brand names include

Polo Ralph
    Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Women’s
    Collection, Black Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren,
    RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, American Living,
    Chaps

and

Club Monaco

, among others.

We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale,
    Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing
    approximately 49% of Fiscal 2011 net revenues) consists of
    wholesale-channel sales made principally to major department
    stores and specialty stores located throughout the U.S., Canada,
    Europe and Asia. Our retail business (representing approximately
    48% of Fiscal 2011 net revenues) consists of retail-channel
    sales directly to consumers through full-price and factory
    retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, South
    America, Europe and Asia; through concessions-based
    shop-within-shops located primarily in Asia; and through our
    domestic retail

e-commerce

sites located at www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com, as well
    as our recently launched United Kingdom retail

e-commerce

site located at www.RalphLauren.co.uk. In addition, our
    licensing business (representing approximately 3% of Fiscal
    2011 net revenues) consists of royalty-based arrangements
    under which we license the right to third parties to use our
    various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale
    of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances,
    in specified geographical areas for specified periods.
    Approximately 33% of our Fiscal 2011 net revenues was
    earned in international regions outside of the U.S. and
    Canada. See Note 22 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues
    by geographic location.

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with
    higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth
    quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third
    quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of
    seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel,

back-to-school

and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment.

Our
    Objectives and Risks

Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury
    lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a
    proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed
    through multiple retail channels in global markets, a
    disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet.
    Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the
    current global economic environment as further discussed below,
    we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to
    execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in
    revenue, net income and operating cash flow.

Our financial performance has been driven by our focus on six
    key objectives:

•

Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core
    and heritage-driven brand;

•

Diversifying and expanding our products and price points,
    distribution channels and geographic regions;

•

Improving brand control and positioning;

•

Focusing on selective strategic partnerships;

•

Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a
    worldwide business; and

•

Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow.

As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control
    has evolved from primarily that of a mono-brand

U.S.-centric

menswear wholesaler with a broad array of product and geographic
    licenses to that of a portfolio of lifestyle brands with a
    “direct control” model over most of our brands,
    products and international territories. We believe that this
    broader and better-diversified portfolio mix positions us for
    ongoing growth, offering our customers a range of products,
    price points and channels of distribution, and our size and
    global operations favorably position us to take advantage of
    synergies in design, sourcing and distribution.

While balancing our long-term key strategic objectives with our
    near-term priorities to manage through the various risks
    associated with the current global economic environment, we
    intend to continue to pursue select



opportunities for growth during the course of Fiscal 2012 and
    beyond. These opportunities and continued investment initiatives
    include:

•

International Growth Opportunities

Ø

Ongoing development and growth of our recently acquired
    businesses in Asia, including the continued execution of our
    plans to expand our retail businesses and maximize our
    distribution opportunities in conjunction with the
    implementation of advertising and marketing strategies to
    elevate brand perception in certain of the markets in this
    region; and

Ø

Continued growth of our European businesses, including the
    introduction of our

Club Monaco

product line and
    continued expansion of our

Lauren

product line across our
    wholesale distribution channels.

•

Direct-to-Consumer

Growth Opportunities

Ø

Global expansion of our

e-commerce

operations, including the continued expansion of our related
    operations in Europe and the introduction of

e-commerce

in Asia.

•

Product Innovation and Brand Extension Growth Opportunities

Ø

Further development and broadening of our luxury accessories
    product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small
    leathergoods and watches/jewelry, and continued worldwide
    expansion of our eyewear distribution;

Ø

Continued expansion of our

Lauren, Club Monaco, Rugby, RRL

and

RLX

product assortments across various categories
    on a global basis;

Ø

Continued extension of our

Home

product lines, including
    within our wholesale distribution channels; and

Ø

Worldwide expansion of our denim product offerings and
    associated distribution channels.

•

Investment in Operational Infrastructure

Ø

Further system enhancements and implementations to meet the
    expanding needs of our global organization, including the
    implementation of a new global financial and reporting system as
    part of a multi-year initiative.

•

Global Talent Development and Management

Ø

Continue to enhance our organizational development and talent
    management to support our global growth initiatives, including
    the formalization of succession plans for key leadership
    positions.

•

Disciplined Cost Management

Ø

Continue to evaluate strategies to leverage higher sales volumes
    more efficiently and explore cost savings opportunities,
    including shared service initiatives.

Global
    Economic Developments

The state of the global economy continues to impact the level of
    consumer spending for discretionary items. This has affected our
    business as it is highly dependent on consumer demand for our
    products. While the U.S. and certain other international
    economies have shown signs of stabilization, there are still
    significant macroeconomic risks such as high rates of
    unemployment, rising fuel prices and continued global economic
    uncertainty, including in Japan where the recent earthquake and
    resulting tsunami and nuclear crisis have caused a significant
    disruption in economic conditions. While the degree to which
    recent events in Japan will affect the global economy remains
    uncertain at this time, the impact is expected to have a
    negative effect on the sales and operating margins of our
    Japanese operations in Fiscal 2012. Further, notwithstanding the
    reported sales and margin growth that we experienced during
    Fiscal 2011, we believe the global macroeconomic environment and
    the ongoing constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and
    modified consumption behavior will continue to have an impact on
    our business for the foreseeable future.

In addition, during the second half of Fiscal 2011 and
    particularly in the fourth quarter, we experienced cost of goods
    inflation as a result of rising costs for raw materials,
    transportation and labor, as well as labor shortages in certain
    regions where our products are manufactured. While we continue
    to evaluate strategic initiatives to mitigate



increases in global labor rates and commodity pricing, we expect
    the increasing sourcing cost pressures to negatively affect the
    cost of most of our products and related gross profit
    percentages to a more significant degree in Fiscal 2012.

We continue to monitor these risks and evaluate our operating
    strategies in order to adjust to changes in economic conditions.

For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have
    the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially
    from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A —

Form 10-K.

Summary
    of Financial Performance

Results
    of Operations

In Fiscal 2011, we reported net revenues of $5.660 billion,
    net income attributable to Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation
    (“PRLC”) of $567.6 million and net income per
    diluted share attributable to PRLC of $5.75. This compares to
    net revenues of $4.979 billion, net income attributable to
    PRLC of $479.5 million and net income per diluted share
    attributable to PRLC of $4.73 in Fiscal 2010.

Our operating performance for Fiscal 2011 was driven by 13.7%
    revenue growth, primarily due to increased comparable global
    retail store sales and the inclusion of revenues from both our
    Asia-Pacific business acquired on December 31, 2009 and our
    South Korea business acquired on January 1, 2011 (see
    “Recent Developments” for further discussion), as well
    as higher revenues from our global wholesale businesses. These
    increases were partially offset by the absence of a

rd

week

    of sales as included in Fiscal 2010, as well as net unfavorable
    foreign currency effects. We also experienced an increase in
    gross profit percentage of 40 basis points to 58.6%,
    primarily due to higher levels of full-price sell-throughs and
    decreased promotional activity across most of our global retail
    businesses as well as growth from the largely concessions-based
    business assumed in the Asia-Pacific and South Korea
    acquisitions, partially offset by lower global wholesale
    margins. These increases were also partially offset by higher
    selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses in Fiscal 2011, attributable largely to additional
    costs to support our growth in sales, as well as new business
    initiatives and acquisitions.

Net income attributable to PRLC increased in Fiscal 2011 as
    compared to Fiscal 2010, primarily due to a $138.2 million
    increase in operating income, partially offset by a
    $48.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes.
    The increase in the provision in income taxes was primarily
    driven by the overall increase in pretax income, along with an
    80 basis point increase in our effective tax rate. Net
    income per diluted share attributable to PRLC also increased due
    to the effect of higher net income coupled with lower
    weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in Fiscal 2011. Our

year-over-year

results were also impacted by additional pretax income of
    approximately $19 million in Fiscal 2010 due to the
    inclusion of the 53rd week, which decreased our net income
    trends by approximately $13 million (approximately $0.13
    per diluted share).

Financial
    Condition and Liquidity

Our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of
    our business results. We ended Fiscal 2011 in a net cash and
    investments position (total cash and cash equivalents plus
    short-term and non-current investments, less total debt) of
    $838.6 million, compared to $940.6 million as of the
    end of Fiscal 2010.

The decrease in our net cash and investments position was
    primarily due to our treasury stock repurchases, capital
    expenditures and the funding of our recent South Korea Licensed
    Operations Acquisition (as defined and discussed under

“Recent Developments”

below), partially offset
    by our operating cash flows and proceeds from stock option
    exercises. Our equity increased to $3.305 billion as of
    April 2, 2011 compared to $3.117 billion as of
    April 3, 2010, primarily due to our net income and other
    comprehensive income, offset in part by our share repurchase
    activity during Fiscal 2011.

We generated $688.7 million of cash from operations during
    Fiscal 2011, compared to $906.5 million during Fiscal 2010.
    The decrease in operating cash flows primarily related to the
    timing of working capital changes, partially offset by an
    increase in net income before non-cash expenses in Fiscal 2011.
    We used some of our cash availability to support our common
    stock repurchase program, to reinvest in our business through
    capital spending and to fund an acquisition. In particular, we
    used $594.6 million to repurchase 6.2 million shares
    of Class A common stock, including shares surrendered for
    tax withholdings; we used $255.0 million for capital
    expenditures



primarily associated with our global retail store expansion,
    construction and renovation of department store

shop-in-shops,

and investments in our facilities and technological
    infrastructure; and we used $47.0 million to fund our
    recent South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition (as defined
    and discussed under

“Recent Developments”

below).

Transactions
    Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

The comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal
    years presented herein has been affected by certain
    transactions, including:

•

Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010 and
    Fiscal 2009. In particular, we completed the South Korea
    Licensed Operations Acquisition on January 1, 2011, the
    Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition on
    December 31, 2009, and the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition on August 1, 2008 (each as defined in
    Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements);

•

Certain pretax charges related to asset impairments and
    restructurings during the fiscal years presented; and

•

A net gain related to a partial extinguishment of our
    Euro-denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009.

A summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax
    income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below
    (references to “Notes” are to the notes to the

    in Fiscal 2010, which resulted in incremental revenues of
    approximately $70 million and additional net income of
    approximately $13 million in Fiscal 2010.

The following discussion of operating results highlights, as
    necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising
    from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or
    transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and
    other financial statement users individually should consider the
    types of events and transactions that have affected operating
    trends.

Recent
    Developments

Greater
    China Restructuring Plan

In May 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to reposition our
    existing distribution network in the Greater China region, which
    is comprised of Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
    This plan is expected to be carried out primarily in Fiscal 2012
    and include a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain
    retail stores and concession shops that do not support the new
    merchandising strategy. Actions related to the restructuring
    plan are anticipated to result in pretax charges of
    approximately $10 million to $20 million in Fiscal
    2012.

South
    Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition

On January 1, 2011, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel and accessories business in South Korea
    (the “Polo South Korea Business”) from a licensed to a
    wholly owned operation, we acquired certain net assets
    (including inventory) and employees from Doosan Corporation
    (“Doosan”) in exchange for an initial payment of
    approximately $25 million plus an additional aggregate
    payment of approximately $22 million (the “South Korea
    Licensed Operations Acquisition”). Doosan was our licensee
    for the Polo South Korea business. We funded the South Korea
    Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash on-hand. In
    conjunction with the South Korea Licensed Operations
    Acquisition, we also entered into a transition services
    agreement with Doosan for the provision of certain financial and
    information systems services for a period of up to twelve months
    commencing on January 1, 2011.



The operating results for the Polo South Korea business have
    been consolidated in our operating results commencing
    January 1, 2011 and are reported on a one-month lag. The
    net effect of this reporting lag is not deemed to be material to
    our consolidated financial statements.

Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition

On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel business in Asia-Pacific (excluding
    Japan and South Korea) from a licensed to a wholly owned
    operation, we acquired certain net assets from Dickson Concepts
    International Limited and affiliates (“Dickson”) in
    exchange for an initial payment of approximately
    $20 million and other consideration of approximately
    $17 million (the “Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition”). Dickson was our licensee for Polo-branded
    apparel in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan and South
    Korea), which is comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
    Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. We
    funded the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition with
    available cash on-hand.

The operating results for the Polo-branded apparel business in
    Asia-Pacific have been consolidated in our operating results
    commencing January 1, 2010.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $681.4 million, or 13.7%, to $5.660 billion in Fiscal
    2011 from $4.979 billion in Fiscal 2010. The increase was
    primarily due to higher revenues from our global retail and



wholesale businesses, partially offset by net unfavorable
    foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of foreign
    currency, net revenues increased by 14.0%.

Wholesale net revenues

— The net increase in
    revenues primarily reflects:

•

a $208 million aggregate net increase in our domestic
    businesses primarily due to increased revenues from our menswear
    and womenswear product lines (offset in part by sales declines
    in related American Living product categories). In addition, our
    accessories product lines (including footwear) contributed to
    the increase in revenues, reflecting an increased presence at
    department store locations as well as additional product
    category offerings. These increases were partially offset by a
    planned reduction in sales for our off-price channel business;

•

a $62 million net increase in our European businesses on a
    constant currency basis primarily driven by increased revenues
    from our menswear and womenswear product lines; and

•

The inclusion of $25 million of incremental revenues in
    connection with the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition, which was included in our results for the full year
    in Fiscal 2011 in comparison to three months in the prior fiscal
    year.

The above net increase was partially offset by:

•

a $25 million net decrease in our Japanese businesses on a
    constant currency basis driven by a decrease in womenswear
    sales; and

•

a $25 million net decrease in revenues due to an
    unfavorable foreign currency effect related to the weakening of
    the Euro, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency
    effect related to the strengthening of the Yen, both in
    comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011.

Retail net revenues

— Within our discussion of
    Retail operating performance below, we refer to the measure
    “comparable store sales.” Comparable store sales refer
    to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one
    full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing during a
    fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable
    store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated,
    enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or
    greater) or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for
    renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable
    store sales until such stores have been in their new location or
    in a newly renovated state for at least one full fiscal year.
    Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren
    (including Rugby) and Club Monaco stores, as well as
    concessions-based shop-within-shops and RalphLauren.com
    (including Rugby.com).

The net increase in Retail net revenues primarily reflects:

•

a $259 million aggregate net increase in non-comparable
    store sales primarily driven by:

Ø

an increase of approximately $137 million related to the
    inclusion of a full year of revenues from stores and
    concession-based shop-within-shops assumed in connection with
    the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations acquisition, in comparison
    to three months in the prior fiscal year;

Ø

the inclusion of approximately $22 million of revenues from
    stores and concession-based shop-within-shops assumed in
    connection with the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition;



Ø

a net aggregate favorable foreign currency effect of
    approximately $8 million, primarily related to the
    strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the overall
    weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011; and

Ø

an increase related to a number of new international full-price
    and factory store openings within the past twelve months,
    including our flagship stores on Madison Avenue in New York and
    in Saint-Germain, Paris, as well as our recently launched United
    Kingdom retail

e-commerce

site. Excluding those stores and shops assumed in connection
    with the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition and the
    South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition (both as discussed
    above), our average global physical store count increased by 35
    stores and concession shops as compared to Fiscal 2010. Our
    total physical store count as of April 2, 2011 included 367
    freestanding stores and 510 concession shops, including 4 stores
    and 178 concession shops relating to the South Korea Licensed
    Operations Acquisition.

•

a $134 million aggregate net increase in comparable
    physical store sales primarily driven by our global factory
    stores, including a net aggregate favorable foreign currency
    effect of approximately $1 million primarily related to the
    strengthening of the Yen, largely offset by the overall
    weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011. The increase in Retail net
    revenues was also due to a $48 million increase in
    RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable store sales are presented
    below on a 52-week basis:

Licensing revenue

— The net decrease in
    revenues primarily reflects:

•

an $8 million decrease in international licensing royalties
    primarily due to the recent Asia-Pacific and South Korea
    Licensed Operations Acquisitions; and

•

a $4 million decrease in home licensing royalties primarily
    driven by lower paint-related royalties.

The above net decrease was partially offset by:

•

a $7 million increase in domestic product licensing
    royalties primarily driven by higher footwear-related and
    fragrance-related royalties.

Gross Profit.

Cost of goods sold includes the
    expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale,
    including product costs, freight-in and import costs, as well as
    changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability.
    The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated
    with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking,
    packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in
    SG&A expenses.

Gross profit increased by $419.2 million, or 14.5%, to
    $3.318 billion in Fiscal 2011 from $2.899 billion in
    Fiscal 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
    increased by 40 basis points to 58.6% in Fiscal 2011 from



58.2% in Fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher
    levels of full-price sell-throughs and decreased promotional
    activity across most of our global retail businesses, as well as
    growth from the retail businesses assumed in the Asia-Pacific
    and South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisitions. The increase
    in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was partially
    offset by lower global wholesale margins, driven by sourcing
    cost pressures experienced during the second half of Fiscal 2011.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a
    variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix
    among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products
    sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs.
    These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.

We expect that current macroeconomic challenges, including
    inflationary pressures on raw material and labor costs as well
    as labor shortages in certain regions where our products are
    manufactured, will negatively affect the cost of our products
    and related gross profit percentages to a more significant
    degree in Fiscal 2012. See “

Global Economic
    Developments

” and Item 1A —

“Risk Factors”

for further discussion.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses primarily include
    compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts,
    information technology, facilities, legal and other costs
    associated with finance and administration. SG&A expenses
    increased by $285.7 million, or 13.2%, to
    $2.443 billion in Fiscal 2011 from $2.157 billion in
    Fiscal 2010. This increase included a net unfavorable foreign
    currency effect of approximately $6 million primarily
    related to strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the
    weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the
    U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses as a
    percent of net revenues decreased slightly to 43.2% in Fiscal
    2011 as compared to 43.3% in Fiscal 2010, reflecting the
    operating leverage of the increase in our net revenues and our
    disciplined expense management, which more than offset the
    increase in operating expenses attributable to our new business
    initiatives and acquisitions. The $285.7 million increase
    in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:

•

the inclusion of additional SG&A costs of approximately
    $108 million related to our newly acquired Polo-branded
    businesses in Asia, including $88 million of incremental
    costs related to the inclusion of a full year of SG&A costs
    associated with the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition
    in comparison to three months in the prior fiscal year, and
    $20 million of SG&A and acquisition-related costs
    related to our recent South Korea Licensed Operations
    Acquisition;

•

higher selling salaries and compensation-related costs of
    approximately $104 million primarily related to the global
    increase in Retail sales and worldwide store expansion, as well
    as higher incentive-based and stock-based compensation expenses;

•

increased brand-related marketing and advertising costs of
    approximately $30 million;

•

increased consulting costs of approximately $23 million,
    including costs relating to new global information technology
    systems;

•

an approximate $14 million increase in rent and utility
    costs primarily to support the ongoing global growth of our
    businesses; and

•

increased selling expenses of approximately $10 million to
    support increased sales.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $3.7 million, or 17.1%, to $25.4 million
    in Fiscal 2011 from $21.7 million in Fiscal 2010. This
    increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of
    amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in
    connection with the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition
    in comparison to three months in the prior fiscal year, as well
    as the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in
    connection with the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition.

Impairments of Assets.

A non-cash impairment
    charge of $2.5 million was recognized in Fiscal 2011 to
    reduce the net carrying values of certain retail store and
    concession shop long-lived assets in the Asia-Pacific region
    that were determined to no longer be used over the intended
    service period to their estimated fair value. During Fiscal
    2010, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of
    $6.6 million to reduce the net carrying values of certain
    long-lived assets primarily in our Retail segment to their
    estimated fair values due to the underperformance



of certain domestic retail stores. See Note 11 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $2.6 million for Fiscal 2011 primarily related to
    employee termination costs associated with our wholesale
    operations and the closing of a warehouse facility, partially
    offset by reversals of reserves deemed no longer necessary
    largely associated with previously closed retail stores.
    Restructuring charges of $6.9 million for Fiscal 2010
    primarily related to employee termination costs, as well as the
    write-down of an asset associated with exiting a retail store in
    Japan. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    by $138.2 million, or 19.6%, to $845.1 million in
    Fiscal 2011 from $706.9 million in Fiscal 2010. Operating
    income as a percentage of net revenues increased 70 basis
    points, to 14.9% in Fiscal 2011 from 14.2% in Fiscal 2010. The
    increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues
    primarily reflected the increase in our overall gross profit
    margin, as previously discussed.

Wholesale operating margin

decreased by 110 basis
    points, primarily as a result of lower global gross profit
    margins reflecting cost pressures experienced during the second
    half of Fiscal 2011, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A
    expenses as a percentage of net revenues due to improved
    operating leverage.

Retail operating margin

increased by 310 basis
    points, primarily as a result of higher gross profit margins
    across most of our global retail businesses primarily driven by
    higher levels of full-price sell-throughs and decreased
    promotional activity across most of our global retail
    businesses. This increase was partially offset by increased
    SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven
    by increased salaries and compensation-related costs, rent
    expenses and marketing and advertising expenses to support the
    ongoing growth of our global Retail businesses.

Licensing operating margin

increased by 210 basis
    points, primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with
    the transition of our licensed businesses to wholly owned
    operations, as well as lower revenues.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $32.2 million, primarily as a result of higher
    incentive-based and stock-based compensation expenses, increased
    information technology costs and higher charitable contributions.

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges, net

for
    Fiscal 2011 included net unallocated restructuring charges of
    $2.6 million that were partially offset by
    $1.4 million of net reversals of legal reserves deemed no
    longer necessary. Fiscal 2010 included restructuring charges of
    $6.9 million and legal charges of $4.8 million
    primarily related to our California Labor Litigation matter,
    offset in part by the reversal of an excess legal reserve of
    $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion).



Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $1.4 million in Fiscal 2011, compared to a loss of
    $2.2 million in Fiscal 2010. Excluding the net increase in
    losses of $5.5 million relating to foreign currency hedge
    contracts, the overall reduction in foreign currency losses was
    primarily due to the timing of the settlement of foreign
    currency-denominated third party and intercompany receivables
    and payables (that were not of a long-term investment nature).
    Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of
    changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating
    results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to
    U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including
    amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our
    capital lease obligations. Interest expense decreased by
    $3.9 million, or 17.6%, to $18.3 million in Fiscal
    2011 from $22.2 million in Fiscal 2010. This decrease was
    primarily due to a lower principal amount of our outstanding
    Euro-denominated 4.5% notes as a result of a partial debt
    extinguishment in July 2009 and reduced interest rates as a
    result of a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap entered into during the first quarter of
    Fiscal 2011, as well as the favorable foreign currency effect
    resulting from the weakening of the Euro during Fiscal 2011.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, decreased by $4.7 million, or 37.9%, to
    $7.7 million in Fiscal 2011 from $12.4 million in
    Fiscal 2010, primarily due to the prior year gain of
    $4.1 million related to the partial extinguishment of our
    Euro-denominated 4.5% notes. The decline in interest and
    other income, net was also driven by a net unfavorable foreign
    currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Euro and
    lower average yields on our cash and cash equivalents during
    Fiscal 2011.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

The equity in loss of equity-method
    investees of $7.7 million and $5.6 million recognized
    in Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively, related to our
    share of losses from our joint venture, the Ralph Lauren Watch
    and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL Watch
    Company”), which is accounted for under the equity method
    of accounting.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by
    $48.0 million, or 22.9%, to $257.8 million in Fiscal
    2011 from $209.8 million in Fiscal 2010. The increase in
    the provision for income taxes was principally due to an overall
    increase in pretax income in Fiscal 2011 and an increase in our
    reported effective tax rate of 80 basis points, to 31.2% in
    Fiscal 2011 from 30.4% in Fiscal 2010. The higher effective tax
    rate was primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings
    generated in higher-taxed jurisdictions for Fiscal 2011. Our
    effective tax rate in both years was favorably impacted by
    reductions in tax reserves associated with conclusions of tax
    examinations and other discrete tax reserve reductions. The
    effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the
    effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign
    jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective
    tax rate will change from year to year based on non-recurring
    factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of
    earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted
    tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and
    settlements, and the interaction of various global tax
    strategies.

Net Income Attributable to PRLC.

Net income
    increased by $88.1 million, or 18.4%, to
    $567.6 million in Fiscal 2011 from $479.5 million in
    Fiscal 2010, primarily related to the $138.2 million
    increase in operating income, partially offset by the
    $48.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes,
    as previously discussed. These results were impacted by
    increased pretax income of approximately $19 million in
    Fiscal 2010 due to the inclusion of the

rd

week, which decreased net income trends by approximately
    $13 million.

Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to
    PRLC.

Net income per diluted share increased by
    $1.02, or 21.6%, to $5.75 per share in Fiscal 2011 from $4.73
    per share in Fiscal 2010, due to the higher level of net income,
    as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted
    shares outstanding primarily driven by share repurchases during
    Fiscal 2011. These results were impacted by increased pretax
    income of approximately $19 million in Fiscal 2010 due to
    the inclusion of the

rd

week, which decreased net income per diluted share trends by
    approximately $0.13.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues decreased by
    $40.0 million, or 0.8%, to $4.979 billion in Fiscal
    2010 from $5.019 billion in Fiscal 2009. The decrease was
    primarily due to lower revenues from our global Wholesale
    businesses, partially offset by a net increase in our global
    Retail sales and net favorable foreign currency effects. Also
    offsetting the decrease in revenues was the inclusion of a

rd

week

    in Fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2009, which
    resulted in incremental revenues of approximately
    $70 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net
    revenues decreased by 1.1%.

Wholesale net revenues

— The net decrease
    primarily reflects:

•

a $154 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic
    businesses primarily due to a decrease in womenswear, menswear
    and childrenswear sales (including a decline in revenues from
    related

American Living

product categories) as a result
    of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment, offset
    in part by higher footwear sales driven by increased door
    penetration;

•

a $36 million net decrease in our Japanese businesses on a
    constant currency basis primarily due to a decrease in
    womenswear sales largely as a result of the ongoing challenging
    global retail environment;

•

a $25 million net decrease in our European businesses on a
    constant currency basis primarily driven by decreased sales in
    our menswear and childrenswear product lines, partially offset
    by an increase in womenswear sales largely due to the inclusion
    of revenues from the newly launched

Lauren

product
    line; and

•

a $2 million net decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable
    foreign currency effect related to the overall weakening of the
    Euro, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency effect
    related to the strengthening of the Yen, both in comparison to
    the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010.

The total net decrease in Wholesale revenues discussed above
    included an approximate $30 million increase due to the
    inclusion of an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared
    to Fiscal 2009.

Retail net revenues

— The net increase in
    Retail net revenues primarily reflects:

•

a $163 million aggregate net increase in non-comparable
    store sales primarily driven by:

Ø

a $40 million increase in revenues due to the inclusion of
    an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009;

Ø

an increase of approximately $32 million on a constant
    currency basis related to the inclusion of a full year of
    revenues from our concessions-based shop-within-shops assumed in
    connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year;

Ø

the inclusion of $29 million of sales from stores and
    concessions-based shop-within-shops assumed in connection with
    the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition;

Ø

an increase related to new store openings within the past twelve
    months. There was a net increase in average global store count
    of 9 stores, to a total of 350 stores, as compared to Fiscal
    2009. The net increase in store count was primarily due to a
    number of new domestic and international full-price and factory
    store openings as well as the inclusion of stores acquired in
    the Asia-Pacific region, offset in part by the closure of
    certain Club Monaco stores; and

Ø

a net aggregate favorable foreign currency effect of
    $16 million primarily related to the strengthening of the
    Yen, partially offset by the overall weakening of the Euro, both
    in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010.

•

a $6 million aggregate net decrease in comparable physical
    store sales driven by our global full-price stores, including a
    net aggregate unfavorable foreign currency effect of
    $2 million primarily related to the overall weakening of
    the Euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the Yen, both
    in comparison to the U.S. dollar



during Fiscal 2010. This decrease was more than offset by a
    $32 million increase in RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable
    store sales are presented below on a 52-week basis:

Licensing revenue

— The net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

a $8 million decrease in international licensing royalties,
    primarily due to the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition as well as the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition; and

•

a $5 million decrease in home licensing royalties primarily
    driven by lower paint and bedding and bath-related royalties.

The above net decrease was partially offset by:

•

a $1 million net increase in product licensing royalties
    primarily driven by higher footwear royalties, partially offset
    by lower fragrance-related royalties.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased by
    $168.4 million, or 6.2%, to $2.899 billion in Fiscal
    2010 from $2.731 billion in Fiscal 2009. Gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues increased by 380 basis points to
    58.2% in Fiscal 2010 from 54.4% in Fiscal 2009. This increase
    was primarily due to supply chain cost savings initiatives,
    improved inventory management and decreased promotional activity
    particularly across our global retail businesses and our
    European wholesale operations, as well as growth in our Japanese
    concessions-based business driven by the Japanese Childrenswear
    and Golf Acquisition.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a
    variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix
    among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products
    sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs.
    These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses increased by
    $121.0 million, or 5.9%, to $2.157 billion in Fiscal
    2010 from $2.036 billion in Fiscal 2009. This increase
    included an unfavorable foreign currency effect of approximately
    $15 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the
    Yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010.
    SG&A expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to
    43.3% in Fiscal 2010 from 40.6% in Fiscal 2009. The
    270 basis point increase was primarily driven by the
    decrease in net revenues, as well as higher compensation-related
    expenses and an increase in operating expenses attributable to
    our new business



initiatives. Including the $15 million unfavorable foreign
    currency effect, the $121.0 million increase in SG&A
    expenses was primarily driven by:

•

higher compensation-related expenses of approximately
    $78 million primarily relating to an increase in
    incentive-based compensation;

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs of approximately
    $35 million associated with the recent Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition;

•

an approximate $22 million increase related to the
    inclusion of a full year of SG&A costs for our recently
    acquired Japanese childrenswear and golf businesses in
    comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, including
    costs incurred pursuant to transition service
    arrangements; and

•

an approximate $17 million increase in rent and utility
    costs primarily to support the ongoing global growth of our
    businesses.

The above increases were partially offset by lower SG&A
    expenses associated with our cost-savings initiatives
    implemented in late Fiscal 2009, as well as:

•

lower selling expenses of approximately $28 million
    principally relating to lower wholesale sales; and

•

an approximate $14 million decrease in brand-related
    marketing and advertising costs.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $1.5 million, or 7.4%, to $21.7 million
    in Fiscal 2010 from $20.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This
    increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of
    amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in
    connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition
    in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, as well
    as amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection
    with the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition.

Impairments of Assets.

A non-cash impairment
    charge of $6.6 million was recognized in Fiscal 2010,
    compared to $55.4 million in Fiscal 2009. These charges
    reduced the net carrying values of certain long-lived assets,
    primarily in our Retail segment, to their estimated fair values.
    These impairment charges were primarily attributable to the

lower-than-expected

operating performances of certain retail stores, which in Fiscal
    2009 arose in large part due to the significant contraction in
    consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that
    fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $6.9 million recognized in Fiscal 2010 primarily related
    to employee termination costs, as well as the write-down of an
    asset associated with exiting a retail store in Japan.
    Restructuring charges of $23.6 million recognized in Fiscal
    2009 were primarily associated with a restructuring plan
    initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better
    align our cost base with lower sales and operating margin trends
    associated with the slowdown in consumer spending, and to
    improve overall operating effectiveness (the “Fiscal 2009
    Restructuring Plan”). This Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan
    included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain
    underperforming retail stores. See Note 12 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    by $111.4 million, or 18.7%, to $706.9 million in
    Fiscal 2010 from $595.5 million in Fiscal 2009. Operating
    income as a percentage of net revenues increased 230 basis
    points, to 14.2% in Fiscal 2010 from 11.9% in Fiscal 2009. The
    increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues
    primarily reflected the increase in gross profit margin and
    lower pretax charges related to asset impairments and
    restructurings, partially offset by the increase in SG&A
    expenses as a percent of net revenues, as previously discussed.

Wholesale operating income

decreased by
    $34.6 million primarily as a result of lower revenues,
    partially offset by higher gross margins driven by improved
    inventory management principally in our European businesses.

Retail operating income

increased by $152.5 million
    primarily as a result of increased revenues and higher gross
    margins across our global Retail businesses driven by decreased
    promotional activity and lower reductions in the carrying cost
    of our retail inventory. The increase was also due to lower
    impairment-related charges. These increases were partially
    offset by increased SG&A expenses primarily driven by
    higher rent and incentive-based compensation expenses.

Licensing operating income

increased by $3.8 million
    primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with the
    transition of our licensed businesses to wholly owned
    operations, offset in part by lower revenues largely driven by a
    decline in international royalties and home licensing royalties.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $23.4 million, primarily as a result of higher
    incentive-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower
    brand-related marketing and advertising costs.

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

of
    $10.0 million in Fiscal 2010 were comprised of
    restructuring charges of $6.9 million primarily related to
    employee termination costs and the write-down of an asset
    associated with exiting a retail store in Japan, as well as
    legal charges of $4.8 million primarily related to our
    California Labor Litigation matter offset in part by the
    reversal of an excess legal reserve of $1.7 million (see
    Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion). In Fiscal 2009, unallocated
    legal and restructuring charges of $23.1 million were
    comprised of restructuring charges of $23.6 million
    primarily associated with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, as
    previously discussed, offset by a reversal of an excess legal
    reserve in the amount of $0.5 million.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to a gain of
    $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009. Excluding a net increase in
    foreign currency gains of $1.0 million relating to
    undesignated foreign currency hedge contracts, the increase in
    foreign currency losses in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal
    2009 was primarily due to the timing of the settlement of
    intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a
    long-term investment nature) between certain of our
    international and domestic subsidiaries. Foreign currency gains
    and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value
    of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased
    by $4.4 million, or 16.5%, to $22.2 million in Fiscal
    2010 from $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009. This decrease was
    primarily due to a lower principal amount of our outstanding
    Euro-denominated 4.5% notes as a result of a partial debt
    extinguishment in July 2009.

Interest and Other Income, net.

Interest and
    other income, net, decreased by $9.6 million, or 43.6%, to
    $12.4 million in Fiscal 2010 from $22.0 million in
    Fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower yields relating to lower
    market rates of interest. This decrease was offset in part by an
    increase in our average balance of cash and cash



equivalents and investments during Fiscal 2010, as well as a net
    gain of $4.1 million related to a partial extinguishment of
    our Euro-denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity-Method
    Investees.

The equity in loss of equity-method
    investees of $5.6 million in Fiscal 2010 related to our
    share of loss from our joint venture, the RL Watch Company,
    which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
    The equity in loss of equity-method investees of
    $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 related to our share of loss
    driven by certain

start-up

costs associated with the RL Watch Company.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by
    $28.3 million, or 15.6%, to $209.8 million in Fiscal
    2010 from $181.5 million in Fiscal 2009. The increase in
    provision for income taxes was primarily a result of higher
    pretax income in Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009. This
    increase was partially offset by a net decline in our reported
    effective tax rate of 50 basis points, to 30.4% in Fiscal
    2010 from 30.9% in Fiscal 2009. The lower effective tax rate was
    primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings generated in
    lower-taxed jurisdictions as well as tax reserve reductions
    principally associated with audit settlements, offset in part by
    certain higher non-deductible expenses.

Net Income Attributable to PRLC.

Net income
    increased by $73.5 million, or 18.1%, to
    $479.5 million in Fiscal 2010 from $406.0 million in
    Fiscal 2009. The increase in net income was primarily due to a
    $111.4 million increase in operating income, offset in part
    by a $28.3 million increase in the provision for income
    taxes, as previously discussed. These results were impacted by a
    $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset
    impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax
    income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of
    the 53

rd

week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of
    increasing our net income trends by approximately
    $54 million.

Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to
    PRLC.

Net income per diluted share increased by
    $0.72, or 18.0%, to $4.73 per share in Fiscal 2010 from $4.01
    per share in Fiscal 2009. The increase in diluted per share
    results was due to the higher level of net income, as previously
    discussed. These results were impacted by a $65.5 million
    reduction in pretax charges related to asset impairments and
    restructurings as well as increased pretax income of
    approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of the

rd

week

    in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of
    increasing our net income per diluted share trends by
    approximately $0.53.

“Net cash and
    investments” is defined as total cash and cash equivalents,
    plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt.

The decrease in our net cash and investments position as of
    April 2, 2011 as compared to April 3, 2010 was
    primarily due to our use of cash to support treasury stock
    repurchases, capital expenditures and the funding of an
    acquisition, partially offset by our operating cash flows and
    proceeds from stock option exercises. Particularly, in Fiscal
    2011, we used $594.6 million to repurchase 6.2 million
    shares of Class A common stock, including shares
    surrendered for tax withholdings, and spent $255.0 million
    for capital expenditures. In addition, we used
    $47.0 million to fund our recent South-Korea Licensed
    Operations Acquisition.



The increase in equity was primarily attributable to our net
    income in Fiscal 2011, offset in part by an increase in treasury
    stock as a result of our common stock repurchase program.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities decreased to
    $688.7 million in Fiscal 2011, as compared to
    $906.5 million in Fiscal 2010. This net decrease in
    operating cash flow was primarily driven by:

•

a decrease related to inventories primarily attributable to the
    timing of inventory receipts, as well as an increase in
    inventory levels to support our new business initiatives, store
    openings and recent acquisitions. The higher

year-over-year

inventory levels also reflect the increased sourcing costs
    during the second half of Fiscal 2011;

•

a decrease related to accounts receivable primarily due to
    increased sales; and

•

a decrease related to income taxes due to the timing of income
    tax payments.

The above decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset
    by:

•

an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization,
    stock-based compensation and other non-cash expenses; and

•

an increase related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
    primarily due to the timing of payments and increased volume of
    shipments.

Other than the items described above, the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating
    fluctuations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $299.4 million in
    Fiscal 2011, as compared to $504.4 million in Fiscal 2010.
    The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

a decrease in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds
    from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2011, we
    used $1.244 billion to purchase investments and received
    $1.242 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2010, we used
    $1.351 billion to purchase investments and received
    $1.072 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments.

The above decrease in cash used in investing activities was
    partially offset by:

•

an increase in cash used in connection with capital
    expenditures. In Fiscal 2011, we spent $255.0 million for
    capital expenditures, as compared $201.3 million in Fiscal
    2010. Our capital expenditures were primarily associated with
    global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of
    department store shop-within-shops, investments in our
    facilities, and enhancements to our global information
    technology systems; and

•

an increase in net cash used to fund our acquisitions and
    ventures. In Fiscal 2011, we used $70.9 million to fund our
    acquisitions and ventures, including $47.0 million to fund
    the South Korea Licensed Operations



Acquisition and $17.0 million to fund the acquisition of
    certain finite-lived intellectual property rights. In Fiscal
    2010, we used $30.8 million primarily to fund the
    Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net
    cash used in financing activities was $512.6 million in
    Fiscal 2011, as compared to $306.4 million in Fiscal 2010.
    The increase in net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

an increase in cash used in connection with repurchases of our
    Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2011, 6.0 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $577.8 million were repurchased pursuant to our common
    stock repurchase program and 0.2 million shares of Class A
    common stock at a cost of $16.8 million were surrendered or
    withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with
    the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Long-Term Stock
    Incentive Plan, as amended (the “1997 Incentive
    Plan”). On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2010,
    2.9 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $215.9 million were repurchased pursuant to our common
    stock repurchase program and 0.3 million shares of Class A
    common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were surrendered
    for tax withholdings; and

•

an increase in cash used to pay dividends. In Fiscal 2011, we
    used $38.5 million to pay dividends as compared to
    $24.7 million in Fiscal 2010, largely due to the increases
    in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.05
    per share to $0.10 per share in November 2009.

The above increases in cash used were partially offset by:

•

a decrease in cash used in connection with our repayment of debt
    in July 2009. In Fiscal 2010, we completed a cash tender offer
    and used $121.0 million to repurchase
    €90.8 million of principal amount of our
    4.5% notes due October 4, 2013. There were no debt
    repurchases during Fiscal 2011;

•

an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee stock
    options. In Fiscal 2011, we received $88.3 million from the
    exercise of employee stock options, as compared to
    $50.5 million in Fiscal 2010; and

•

an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation
    arrangements of $17.4 million in Fiscal 2011, as compared
    to the prior fiscal year.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $906.5 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to
    $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This net increase in
    operating cash flow was primarily driven by:

•

lower accounts receivable levels due to improved cash
    collections and lower sales in our Wholesale segment;

•

an increase related to inventory primarily due to the effects of
    ongoing inventory management across most businesses; and

•

an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization,
    stock-based compensation and other non-cash expenses, including
    impairments of assets.

The above increases in cash provided by operating activities
    were partially offset by:

•

a decrease related to income taxes primarily due to the timing
    of payments.



Other than the items described above, the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating
    fluctuations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $504.4 million in
    Fiscal 2010, as compared to $458.0 million in Fiscal 2009.
    The net increase in cash used in investing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds
    from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2010, we
    used $1.351 billion to purchase investments and received
    $1.072 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, we used
    $623.1 million to purchase investments, less
    $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments;

•

an increase in cash used in connection with capital
    expenditures. In Fiscal 2010, we spent $201.3 million for
    capital expenditures, as compared to $185.0 million in
    Fiscal 2009. Our capital expenditures were primarily associated
    with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation
    of department store shop-within-shops and investments in our
    facilities and technological infrastructure; and

•

a change in cash deposits restricted in connection with taxes.
    In Fiscal 2010, net restricted cash of $6.2 million was
    released, as compared to $26.9 million of restricted cash
    released in Fiscal 2009 primarily in connection with the partial
    settlement of certain international tax matters.

The above increases in cash used in investing activities were
    partially offset by:

•

a decrease in net cash used to fund our acquisitions and
    ventures. In Fiscal 2010, we used $30.8 million primarily
    to fund the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition. On a
    comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, we used $46.3 million
    primarily to fund the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition and to complete the minority interest buyout related
    to the acquisition of certain of our formerly-licensed Japanese
    businesses.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

Net
    cash used in financing activities was $306.4 million in
    Fiscal 2010, as compared to $352.1 million in Fiscal 2009.
    The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily driven by:

•

a decrease in cash used in connection with our repayment of
    debt. In Fiscal 2010, we completed a cash tender offer and used
    $121.0 million to repurchase €90.8 million of
    principal amount of our 4.5% notes due October 4,
    2013. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, we repaid
    ¥20.5 billion ($196.8 million as of the repayment
    date) of borrowings under a one-year term loan agreement
    pursuant to an amendment and restatement to our then existing
    credit facility; and

•

an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee stock
    options. In Fiscal 2010, we received $50.5 million from the
    exercise of employee stock options, as compared to
    $29.0 million in Fiscal 2009.

The above decrease in cash used in financing activities was
    partially offset by:

•

an increase in cash used in connection with repurchases of our
    Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million
    shares of Class A common stock at a cost of
    $215.9 million were repurchased pursuant to our common
    stock repurchase program and 0.3 million shares of Class A
    common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were surrendered or
    withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with
    the vesting of awards under the 1997 Incentive Plan. On a
    comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, $169.8 million of cash
    was used in connection with common stock repurchases and shares
    surrendered for tax withholdings.

Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated
    from our operations, $500 million of availability under our
    Global Credit Facility (as defined below), available cash and
    cash equivalents (certain of which is considered permanently
    reinvested outside the U.S.), investments and other available
    financing options. These sources of liquidity are used to fund
    our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital
    requirements, global retail store expansion and renovation,
    construction and renovation of

shop-in-shops,

investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, joint
    ventures, dividends, debt repayment/repurchase, stock
    repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax
    positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes
    that our existing



sources of cash will be sufficient to support our operating,
    capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable
    future, including the ongoing development of our recently
    acquired businesses and our plans for further business expansion.

As discussed in the

“Debt and Covenant Compliance”

section below, we had no revolving credit borrowings
    outstanding under our Global Credit Facility as of April 2,
    2011. As discussed further below, we may elect to draw on our
    Global Credit Facility or other potential sources of financing
    for, among other things, a material acquisition, settlement of a
    material contingency (including uncertain tax positions) or a
    material adverse business development, as well as for other
    general corporate business purposes. We believe that our Global
    Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue
    concentrations in any one financial institution. In particular,
    as of April 2, 2011, there were nine financial institutions
    participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one
    participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in
    excess of approximately 16%. Management has no reason at this
    time to believe that the participating institutions will be
    unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in
    accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility in the
    event of our election to draw funds in the foreseeable future.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

During Fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors approved an expansion
    of our existing stock repurchase program allowing us to
    repurchase up to an additional $775 million in Class A
    common stock, $275 million of which was approved on
    May 18, 2010, $250 million of which was approved on
    August 5, 2010, and $250 million of which was approved
    on February 8, 2011. Repurchases of shares of Class A
    common stock are subject to overall business and market
    conditions.

In Fiscal 2011, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $577.8 million under
    our share repurchase program, including a repurchase of
    1.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $81.0 million in connection with a secondary stock
    offering (as discussed in Note 18 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements). In addition, in Fiscal 2011,
    0.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $16.8 million were surrendered or withheld in
    satisfaction of taxes in connection with the vesting of awards
    issued under the 1997 Incentive Plan. The remaining availability
    under our common stock repurchase program was approximately
    $472 million and $275 million as of April 2, 2011
    and April 3, 2010, respectively.

In Fiscal 2010, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $215.9 million under
    our repurchase program. In addition, 0.3 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were
    surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of taxes in connection
    with the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Incentive Plan.

In Fiscal 2009, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $126.2 million.
    Also, during the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, 0.4 million
    shares traded prior to the end of Fiscal 2008 were settled at a
    cost of $24.0 million. In addition, in Fiscal 2009,
    0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $19.6 million were surrendered or withheld in
    satisfaction of taxes in connection with the vesting of awards
    issued under the 1997 Incentive Plan.

On May 24, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a further
    expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that
    will allow us to repurchase up to an additional
    $500 million of Class A common stock.

Dividends

Since 2003, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend
    program on our common stock. On November 4, 2009, our Board
    of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend
    on our common stock from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share. On
    February 8, 2011, our Board of Directors approved an
    additional increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common
    stock from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share. Dividends paid
    amounted to $38.5 million in Fiscal 2011,
    $24.7 million in Fiscal 2010, and $19.9 million in
    Fiscal 2009.

We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on our
    outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and
    pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of
    our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things,
    our results of operations, cash requirements, financial
    condition and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem
    relevant.



Debt
    and Covenant Compliance

Euro
    Debt

As of April 2, 2011, we had outstanding
    €209.2 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due
    October 4, 2013 (the “Euro Debt”). We have the
    option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any time at
    a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a premium.
    We also have the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro
    Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest in the event of
    certain developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial
    redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance.
    In the event of a change of control, each holder of the Euro
    Debt has the option to require us to redeem the Euro Debt at its
    principal amount plus accrued interest. The indenture governing
    the Euro Debt (the “Indenture”) contains certain
    limited covenants that restrict our ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur liens or enter into a sale and
    leaseback transaction for any principal property. The Indenture
    does not contain any financial covenants.

As of April 2, 2011, the carrying value of our Euro Debt
    was $291.9 million, compared to $282.1 million as of
    April 3, 2010.

In July 2009, we completed a cash tender offer and used
    $121.0 million to repurchase €90.8 million of
    principal amount of our then outstanding €300 million
    principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 at
    a discounted purchase price of approximately 95%. A net pretax
    gain of $4.1 million related to this extinguishment of debt
    was recorded during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 and
    classified as a component of interest and other income, net in
    our consolidated statement of operations. We used our cash
    on-hand to fund the debt extinguishment.

Revolving
    Credit Facilities

Global
    Credit Facility

On March 10, 2011, we entered into a new credit facility
    that provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving
    line of credit through March 2016 (the “Global Credit
    Facility”). The Global Credit Facility replaced our
    previous $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit
    scheduled to mature in November 2011. Key changes under the
    Global Credit Facility include:

•

an increase in our ability to expand its additional borrowing
    availability from $600 million under the previous facility
    to $750 million, subject to the agreement of one or more
    new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their
    commitments;

•

an increase in the margin over LIBOR paid on amounts drawn under
    the Global Credit Facility to 112.5 basis points (subject
    to adjustment based on our credit ratings) from 25 basis
    points;

•

an increase in the commitment fee for the unutilized portion of
    the Global Credit Facility to 15 basis points (subject to
    adjustment based on our credit ratings) from 7 basis
    points; and

•

an ability to denominate borrowings in currencies other than
    U.S. dollars, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and
    Japanese Yen.

Consistent with the previous facility, the Global Credit
    Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of April 2, 2011, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Global Credit Facility and we were
    contingently liable for $16.8 million of outstanding
    letters of credit.

U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings under the Global Credit
    Facility bear interest, at our option, either at (a) a base
    rate, by reference to the greatest of: (i) the annual prime
    commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect
    from time to time, (ii) the weighted-average overnight
    Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) the
    one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus
    100 basis points; or (b) LIBOR, adjusted for the
    Federal Reserve Board’s Eurocurrency liabilities maximum
    reserve percentage, plus a spread of 112.5 basis points,
    subject to adjustment based on our credit ratings
    (“Adjusted LIBOR”). Foreign currency-denominated
    borrowings bear interest at Adjusted LIBOR, as described above.
    There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability
    throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.



In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Global Credit Facility, we are required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Global Credit Facility
    in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee
    rate of 15 basis points under the terms of the Global
    Credit Facility is subject to adjustment based on our credit
    ratings.

The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that,
    among other things, restrict our ability, subject to specified
    exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens, sell or
    dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. The Global Credit Facility also requires us to
    maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated
    EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”) of no greater than 3.75
    as of the date of measurement for the four most recent
    consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally
    as consolidated debt outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent
    expense for the last four consecutive fiscal quarters.
    Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net
    income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest
    expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and
    (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of April 2, 2011,
    no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the
    Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit
    Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global
    Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate
    the Global Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding
    to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility
    specifies a number of events of default (many of which are
    subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others,
    the failure to make timely principal, interest and fee payments
    or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant
    described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility
    provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph
    Lauren, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and entities
    controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified
    minimum percentage of the voting power or common stock.

Chinese
    Credit Facility

On February 10, 2011, two of our subsidiaries, Polo Ralph
    Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., LTD and Polo Ralph Lauren
    Commerce and Trading (Shanghai) Co., LTD, entered into an
    uncommitted credit facility that provides for a revolving line
    of credit of up to 70 million Chinese Renminbi
    (approximately $10 million) through February 9, 2012
    (the “Chinese Credit Facility”). The Chinese Credit
    Facility will be used to fund general working capital funding
    needs of our operations in China. The borrowing availability
    under the Chinese Credit Facility is at the sole discretion of
    JPMorgan Chase Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch
    (the “Bank”) and is subject to availability of the
    Bank’s funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory
    requirements. Borrowings under the Chinese Credit Facility are
    guaranteed by the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and bear
    interest at either (i) at least 90% of the short-term
    interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China or
    (ii) a rate determined by the Bank at its discretion based
    on prevailing market conditions. As of April 2, 2011, there
    were no borrowings outstanding under the Chinese Credit Facility.

The following is a description of our material, firmly committed
    contractual obligations as of April 2, 2011:

•

Euro Debt

represents the principal amount due at maturity
    of our outstanding Euro Debt on a U.S. dollar-equivalent
    basis. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call
    premiums or interest payments (see below);

•

Interest payments on Euro Debt

represent the annual
    contractual interest payments due on our Euro Debt;

•

Lease obligations

represent the minimum lease rental
    payments under noncancelable leases for our real estate and
    operating equipment in various locations around the world.
    Approximately 59% of these lease obligations relates to our
    retail operations. Information has been presented separately for
    operating and capital leases. In addition to such amounts, we
    are normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy
    costs relating to our leased real estate properties;

•

Inventory purchase commitments

represent our legally
    binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of
    goods at determinable prices; and

•

Other commitments

primarily represent our legally binding
    obligations under sponsorship, licensing and other marketing and
    advertising agreements; information technology related service
    agreements; capital projects; and pension-related obligations.

Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the
    non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
    $156.4 million as of April 2, 2011, as we cannot make
    a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be
    settled, if ever.

The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts
    included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance
    sheet as of April 2, 2011 as these items will be paid
    within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have
    no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue)
    or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do
    not represent a “purchase obligation” as the term is
    used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items).

We also have certain contractual arrangements that would require
    us to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See
    Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for a description of our contingent commitments not
    included in the above table.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In addition to the commitments included in the above table, our
    other off-balance sheet firm commitments, which include
    outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding commitments to
    investees, amounted to approximately $17 million as of
    April 2, 2011. We do not maintain any other off-balance
    sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other
    relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be
    expected to have a material current or future effect on our
    financial condition or results of operations.



MARKET
    RISK MANAGEMENT

We are exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated
    cash flows from our international operations and possible
    declines in the value of reported net assets of certain of our
    foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our
    fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, in the normal course of business we employ
    established policies and procedures, including the use of
    derivative financial instruments, to manage such risks. We do
    not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or
    trading purposes.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed
    to the risk that counterparties to our derivative contracts will
    fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into
    contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based
    upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. Our
    established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk
    on derivative transactions include reviewing and assessing the
    creditworthiness of counterparties. As a result of the above
    considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any
    undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our
    derivative contracts as of April 2, 2011.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

We manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts.
    Refer to Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial
    statements for a summarization of the notional amounts and fair
    values of our foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as
    of April 2, 2011.

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

From time to time, we may enter into forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts as hedges to reduce our risk from exchange
    rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty
    payments made by certain of our international operations,
    intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing
    efforts of our international operations, interest payments made
    in connection with outstanding debt, and other foreign
    currency-denominated operational cash flows. As part of our
    overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to
    changes in the value of the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Hong
    Kong Dollar, the Swiss Franc and the British Pound Sterling, we
    hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures anticipated
    over the ensuing twelve-month to two-year periods. In doing so,
    we use foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have
    maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing
    coverage throughout the hedging period.

Our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by
    policies and procedures approved by our Audit Committee. Our
    policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the
    management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities
    are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies
    include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk
    management function and for internal controls over foreign
    exchange risk management activities, including but not limited
    to authorization levels, transactional limits, and credit
    quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring
    compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different
    techniques, including a periodic review of market value and
    sensitivity analyses.

We record our foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value
    in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent foreign
    currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at
    hedge inception are highly effective in offsetting the change in
    the value of the hedged item, the related gains (losses) are
    initially deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently
    recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as
    follows:

•

Forecasted Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as
    part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of
    goods sold when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency gains
    (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Interest Payments on Euro Debt

— Recognized
    within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which
    the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency
    exchange remeasurement.



We recognized net gains on foreign currency exchange contracts
    in earnings of approximately $10 million for Fiscal 2011
    and $13 million for Fiscal 2010, and net losses of
    approximately $6 million for Fiscal 2009.

Sensitivity

We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that
    market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our
    derivative financial instruments. To perform the sensitivity
    analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the
    effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by all foreign
    currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. dollar.
    Based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as
    of April 2, 2011, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar
    as compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for
    currencies under contract as of April 2, 2011 would result
    in approximately $1 million of net unrealized losses.
    Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would
    result in approximately $1 million of net unrealized gains.
    As our outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts are
    primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted
    transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10%
    devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes
    in the underlying hedged items.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

We designated the entire principal amount of our outstanding
    Euro Debt as a hedge of our net investment in certain of our
    European subsidiaries. The changes in fair value of a derivative
    instrument or changes in a non-derivative financial instrument
    (such as debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment
    in a foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a
    translation adjustment, to the extent it is effective as a
    hedge. As such, changes in the Euro Debt resulting from changes
    in the Euro exchange rate have been, and continue to be,
    reported in equity as a component of AOCI. We recorded within
    other comprehensive income the translation effects of the Euro
    Debt to U.S. dollars, resulting in a loss of
    $13.1 million for Fiscal 2011, a loss of $1.8 million
    for Fiscal 2010, and a gain of $66.6 million for Fiscal
    2009.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

During the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, we entered into a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to mitigate
    our exposure to changes in the fair value of our Euro Debt due
    to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The interest rate
    swap, which has a maturity date of October 4, 2013, has an
    aggregate notional value of €209.2 million and swaps
    the 4.5% fixed interest rate on our Euro Debt for a variable
    interest rate equal to the

3-month

Euro
    Interbank Offered Rate plus 299 basis points. Our interest
    rate swap meets the requirements for shortcut method accounting.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap
    are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the Euro
    Debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded during Fiscal 2011.
    On April 11, 2011, we terminated the interest rate swap,
    the effect of which did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Sensitivity

As of April 2, 2011, notwithstanding the aforementioned

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap contract related to our Euro Debt, we had no
    variable-rate debt outstanding. As of April 2, 2011, the
    carrying value of our Euro Debt was $291.9 million and the
    fair value was $305.0 million. Excluding the interest rate
    swap, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of
    interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the
    fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $2 million.
    Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain
    simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro currency
    exchange rates and an immediate

across-the-board

increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no
    other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.

Investment
    Risk Management

As of April 2, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents
    on-hand of $453.0 million, primarily invested in money
    market funds, time deposits and treasury bills with original
    maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant
    investments included $593.9 million of short-term
    investments, primarily in municipal bonds, time deposits and
    variable rate municipal securities with original maturities
    greater than 90 days; $51.3 million of restricted cash



placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral primarily to
    secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax
    matters; $80.8 million of investments with maturities
    greater than one year; $2.3 million of auction rate
    securities issued through a municipality and $0.5 million
    of other securities.

We evaluate investments held in unrealized loss positions for

other-than-temporary

impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a
    variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and
    uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and
    distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. We consider the
    following factors: (i) the length of time and the extent to
    which the fair value has been below cost, (ii) the
    financial condition, credit worthiness and near-term prospects
    of the issuer, (iii) the length of time to maturity,
    (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts,
    (v) our intent and ability to retain our investment for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value,
    and (vi) an assessment of whether it is
    more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell our
    investment before recovery of market value.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is
    important to our financial condition and results of operations
    and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of
    management in its application. Our estimates are often based on
    complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management
    believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and
    unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals,
    applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and
    circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative
    estimated amounts. We believe that the following list represents
    our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our
    significant accounting policies, see Note 3 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.

Sales
    Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts

A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and
    net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that
    portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In
    particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including

e-commerce

sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns.

In determining estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes
    historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market
    conditions and retailer performance. We review and refine these
    estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of
    these costs have not differed materially from actual results.

Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to
    determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant
    judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation,
    including an analysis of specific risks on a

customer-by-customer

basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging
    analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has
    historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this
    information, management provides a reserve for the estimated
    amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management
    believes that it has adequately provided for those risks as part
    of our bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact
    on our major customers’ business operations could have a
    corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash
    flows

and/or

financial condition.

See “Accounts Receivable” in Note 3 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an
    analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and allowance for
    doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.

Inventories

We hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution
    channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores,
    including our own retail stores. We also hold retail inventory
    that is sold in our own stores and

e-commerce

sites directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories
    are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value
    with cost primarily determined on a weighted-average cost basis.

We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories,
    assessing slow-turning product and fashion product. Estimated
    realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis
    of historical and forecasted



sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of
    market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current
    orders in-house relating to the future sales of inventory.
    Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity,
    quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer
    preferences and market conditions. Our historical estimates of
    these costs and the provisions have not differed materially from
    actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.

Business
    Combinations

In connection with our business combinations (whether partial,
    full or step acquisitions), we are required to record all of the
    assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value;
    recognize contingent consideration at fair value on the
    acquisition date; and, for certain arrangements, recognize
    changes in fair value in earnings until settlement. These fair
    value determinations require management’s judgment and may
    involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions,
    including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and
    outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples,
    among other items.

In addition, in connection with our business acquisitions, we
    evaluate the terms of any pre-existing relationships to
    determine if a settlement of the pre-existing relationship
    exists. These pre-existing relationships primarily relate to
    licensing agreements. If the terms of the pre-existing
    relationships were determined to not be reflective of market, a
    settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings,
    measured by the amount in which the contract is favorable or
    unfavorable to us when compared with pricing for current market
    transactions for the same or similar items. We allocate the
    aggregate consideration exchanged in these transactions between
    the value of the business acquired and the value of the
    settlement of any pre-existing relationships in proportion to
    estimates of their respective fair values. Accordingly,
    significant judgment is required to determine the respective
    fair values of the business acquired and the value of the
    settlement of the pre-existing relationship. We may utilize
    independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of
    fair value.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We use judgment in our determination of the fair value of a
    particular asset or liability when evaluating the inputs used in
    valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to
    which the inputs are market-based (observable) or internally
    derived (unobservable). See Note 15 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion
    of our fair value measurements.

The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities is
    determined using a pricing model, which is primarily based on
    market observable external inputs, including forward and spot
    rates for foreign currencies and considers the impact of our
    credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are
    also considered in the valuation of derivative financial
    instruments.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill, including any goodwill included in the carrying value
    of investments accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have
    indefinite useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and
    such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for
    impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are
    amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and,
    along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment
    periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable.

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify
    potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting
    unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including
    goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
    carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
    not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the
    impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
    goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of
    impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that



goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
    combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is
    allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit
    (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the
    reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
    the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the
    reporting unit.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first
    step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair
    value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit
    (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step
    of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and
    often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
    Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the
    fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
    impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such
    charge. To assist management in the process of determining
    goodwill impairment, we review and consider appraisals from
    independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are
    primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market
    comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use
    significant estimates and assumptions, including projected
    future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting
    the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates
    and determination of appropriate market comparables.

The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
    asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition,
    in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability,
    we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. To the
    extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
    attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between
    the carrying value of such asset and its fair value.

We performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill during
    the second quarter of Fiscal 2011. Based on the results of the
    impairment assessment as of July 4, 2010, we confirmed that
    the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective
    carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of
    impairment. Additionally, there have been no impairment losses
    recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability
    of goodwill or other intangible assets during any of the three
    fiscal years presented.

Impairment
    of Other Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
    recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted
    net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the
    carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the
    difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair
    value, considering external market participant assumptions.
    Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan
    of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair
    value less costs to sell.

In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into
    account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the
    emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of
    macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts
    of more experienced retail store managers and increased local
    advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an
    estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments
    in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.

During Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, we recorded
    non-cash impairment charges of $2.5 million,
    $6.6 million, and $55.4 million, respectively, to
    reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets
    primarily in our Retail segment to their estimated fair value.
    See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion.



Income
    Taxes

In determining the income tax provision for financial reporting
    purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If
    we consider that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, we
    recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by
    determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely
    of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and
    we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent
    that our estimates may change or the final tax outcome of these
    matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences
    will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such
    determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to
    result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor
    our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit if
    (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that
    sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical
    merits of the position to more-likely-than-not, (ii) the
    statute of limitations expires, or (iii) there is a
    completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax
    year with the appropriate agency.

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net
    operating loss, capital loss and general business credit
    carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences
    between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
    financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under
    enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established
    when management determines that it is
    “more-likely-than-not” that some portion or all of a
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation
    allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy
    of future expected taxable income, which typically involves the
    significant use of estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.

Contingencies

We are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the
    ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain
    litigations, alleged information system security breach matters,
    contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax
    audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and
    disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the
    extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the
    related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably
    possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could
    exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated
    impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operations. Management considers many factors in making these
    assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is
    inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series
    of complex judgments about future events including, but not
    limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties
    and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss
    contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We expense all share-based payments to employees and
    non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the
    awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated
    forfeitures.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
    estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires
    the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key assumptions
    involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors
    influencing the estimation process include the expected term of
    the option, the expected stock price volatility factor, the
    expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate, among
    others. Generally, once stock option values are determined,
    current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed,
    even if the estimates used are different from the actuals.

Determining the fair value of stock-based compensation at the
    date of grant requires significant judgment by management,
    including estimates of the above Black-Scholes assumptions. In
    addition, judgment is required in



estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to
    be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these
    estimates, if management changes the assumptions for future
    stock-based award grants, or if there are changes in market
    conditions, stock-based compensation expense and our results of
    operations could be materially impacted.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)

We grant restricted shares of Class A common stock and
    service-based RSUs to certain of our senior executives and
    non-employee directors. In addition, we grant performance-based
    RSUs to such senior executives and other key executives, and
    certain of our other employees. The fair values of restricted
    stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair value of
    unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect
    the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that
    are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense
    for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the related
    service period when attainment of the performance goals is
    deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of
    management.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other
    procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
    issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time period specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
    Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that material
    information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
    that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s
    management, including its principal executive and principal
    financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal
    year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation,
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as
    of the fiscal year end covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



(b) Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in Securities Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and preparation of financial statements for external
    purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    for preparation of our financial statements; providing
    reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company’s assets are made in accordance with management
    authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our
    financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely
    basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
    over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute
    assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would
    be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was
    made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in
    future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the
    fiscal year covered by this report based on the framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on
    this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s
    internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level as of the fiscal year end covered by
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

On January 1, 2011, we acquired control of the Polo-branded
    apparel business in South Korea from Doosan that was formerly
    conducted under a licensed arrangement (the “South Korea
    Licensed Operations Acquisition,” as discussed in
    Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements). We are in the process of evaluating the internal
    controls of the acquired business. However, as permitted by
    related SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired
    businesses, we excluded the acquired business in South Korea
    from management’s annual assessment of the effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 2, 2011. In the aggregate, our business in South
    Korea represented approximately 2% of our total consolidated
    assets and less than 1% of our total consolidated revenues as of
    and for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2011.

Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as included elsewhere herein.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
    Reporting

Except as discussed below, there has been no change in our
    internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
    quarter of Fiscal 2011 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

South
    Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition

In connection with the South Korea Licensed Operations
    Acquisition, we have developed a supporting infrastructure
    covering all critical operations, including but not limited to,
    merchandising, sales, inventory management, customer service,
    distribution, store operations, real estate management, finance
    and other administrative areas. As part of the development of
    this infrastructure, we have implemented and will continue to
    enhance various processes, systems, and internal controls to
    support this business.

Global
    Financial and Reporting System Implementation

We are in the process of implementing a new global financial and
    reporting system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and
    upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes. The
    implementation of this global system is scheduled to occur in
    phases over the next several years, and began with the migration
    of certain of our domestic human resource systems to the new
    system during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011. This
    implementation



effort will continue in the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, when
    certain of our domestic operational and financial systems will
    be transitioned to the new global financial and reporting
    system. As the phased implementation of this system occurs, we
    will experience changes to our processes and procedures which
    will in turn result in changes in internal control over
    financial reporting. While we expect this new system to
    strengthen our internal financial controls by automating manual
    processes and standardizing business processes across our
    organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor
    our internal controls as processes and procedures in each of the
    affected areas evolve. For a discussion of risks related to the
    implementation of new systems, see Item 1A —

“Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
    Business — Our business could suffer if our computer
    systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate
    effectively.”

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Description
    of Business

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (“PRLC”) is a global
    leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium
    lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s and
    children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. PRLC’s long-standing reputation and
    distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    PRLC’s brand names include

Polo Ralph Lauren, Ralph
    Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Women’s Collection, Black
    Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby,
    Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, American Living, Chaps

and

Club Monaco

, among others. PRLC and its subsidiaries are
    collectively referred to herein as the “Company,”
    “we,” “us,” “our” and
    “ourselves,” unless the context indicates otherwise.

The Company classifies its businesses into three segments:
    Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. The Company’s wholesale
    sales are made principally to major department and specialty
    stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. The
    Company also sells directly to consumers through full-price and
    factory retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada,
    Europe, South America and Asia, through concessions-based
    shop-within-shops located primarily in Asia, through its
    domestic retail

e-commerce

sites located at www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com and its
    recently launched United Kingdom retail

e-commerce

site located at www.RalphLauren.co.uk. In addition, the Company
    often licenses the right to unrelated third parties to use its
    various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale
    of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances,
    in specified geographical areas for specified periods.

2.

Basis of
    Presentation

Basis
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. (“US GAAP”) and present the financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company,
    including all entities in which the Company has a controlling
    financial interest and is determined to be the primary
    beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company utilizes a

52-53 week

fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As
    such, Fiscal 2011 ended on April 2, 2011 and reflected a
    52-week period; Fiscal 2010 ended on April 3, 2010 and
    reflected a

53-week

period; and Fiscal 2009 ended on March 28, 2009 and
    reflected a 52-week period.

In April 2009, the Company performed an internal legal entity
    reorganization of certain of its wholly owned Japan
    subsidiaries. As a result of the reorganization, the
    Company’s former Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation and
    Impact 21 Co., Ltd. subsidiaries were merged into a new wholly
    owned subsidiary named Polo Ralph Lauren Kabushiki Kaisha
    (“PRL KK”). The financial position and operating
    results of the Company’s consolidated PRL KK entity are
    reported on a one-month lag. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operating results for Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009
    include the operating results of PRL KK for the twelve-month
    periods ended February 26, 2011, February 28, 2010 and
    February 28, 2009, respectively.

The financial position and operating results of the
    Company’s Polo-branded apparel and accessories business in
    South Korea acquired from Doosan Corporation
    (“Doosan”) on January 1, 2011 (the “Polo
    South Korea business”) are also reported on a one-month
    lag. Accordingly, the Company’s operating results for
    Fiscal 2011 include the operating results of the Polo South
    Korea business for the two-month period ended February 26,
    2011.

The net effect of these reporting lags is not material, either
    individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements include reserves for bad debt,
    customer returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks; the realizability of
    inventory; reserves for litigation and other contingencies;
    useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and
    intangible assets; accounting for income taxes and related
    uncertain tax positions; the valuation of stock-based
    compensation and related expected forfeiture rates; reserves for
    restructuring; and accounting for business combinations.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    periods’ financial information in order to conform to the
    current period’s presentation.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when
    there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has
    occurred, price has been fixed or is determinable and
    collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenue within the Company’s Wholesale segment is
    recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of
    estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances, operational chargebacks and certain
    cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances
    require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on
    trade terms. Estimates for

end-of-season

markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and
    forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic
    and market conditions, retailer performance and, in certain
    cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks
    are based on actual notifications of order fulfillment
    discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Retail store and concessions-based shop-within-shop revenue is
    recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to
    consumers.

E-commerce

revenue from sales of products ordered through the
    Company’s retail Internet sites is recognized upon delivery
    and receipt of the shipment by its customers. Such revenue is
    also reduced by an estimate of returns.

Gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability
    until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
    The Company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the
    likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is remote
    and the Company determines that it does not have a legal
    obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to the
    relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property.

Revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized when earned in
    accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements,
    generally based upon the higher of (a) contractually
    guaranteed minimum royalty levels or (b) actual sales and
    royalty data, or estimates thereof, received from the
    Company’s licensees.

The Company accounts for sales and other related taxes on a net
    basis, excluding such taxes from revenue.

Cost
    of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and
    produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in
    and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage
    and inventory realizability. Gains and

losses associated with foreign currency exchange contracts
    related to the hedging of inventory purchases also are
    recognized within cost of goods sold when the inventory being
    hedged is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including
    those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such
    as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges
    (“handling costs”), are included in selling, general
    and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

The costs associated with shipping goods to customers are
    reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Shipping costs were
    approximately $30 million in Fiscal 2011, $28 million
    in Fiscal 2010 and $27 million in Fiscal 2009. Handling
    costs, which are described above, were approximately
    $108 million in Fiscal 2011, $95 million in Fiscal
    2010 and $97 million in Fiscal 2009, and are also included
    within SG&A expenses. Shipping and handling costs billed to
    customers are included in revenue.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising,
    are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Costs of

out-of-store

advertising paid to wholesale customers under cooperative
    advertising programs are expensed as an advertising cost if both
    the identified advertising benefit is sufficiently separable
    from the purchase of the Company’s products by customers
    and the fair value of such benefit is measurable. Otherwise,
    such costs are reflected as a reduction of revenue. Costs of
    in-store advertising paid to wholesale customers under
    cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising
    costs, but are reflected as a reduction of revenues since the
    benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of
    the Company’s products by customers.

Advertising expense amounted to approximately $192 million
    for Fiscal 2011, $157 million for Fiscal 2010 and
    $171 million for Fiscal 2009. Deferred advertising costs,
    which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet
    been exhibited or services that have not yet been received, were
    approximately $6 million and $4 million at the end of
    Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and operating results of foreign
    operations are primarily consolidated using the local currency
    as the functional currency. Local currency assets and
    liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the
    balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are
    translated at average rates of exchange during the period. The
    resulting translation gains or losses are included in the
    consolidated statements of equity as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). Gains and losses
    on translation of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries
    of a long-term investment nature also are included within this
    component of equity.

The Company also recognizes gains and losses on transactions
    that are denominated in a currency other than the respective
    entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses also include amounts realized on the settlement
    of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are either
    of a short-term investment nature or were previously of a
    long-term investment nature and deferred as a component of
    equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
    recognized in earnings and separately disclosed in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the
    consolidated statements of equity, consists of net income (loss)
    and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under US GAAP,
    are excluded from net income (loss). The components of other
    comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) for the Company
    primarily consist of foreign currency translation gains and
    losses; unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

investments; unrealized gains and losses related to the
    accounting for defined benefit plans; and unrealized gains and
    losses on designated

hedging instruments, such as forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts designated as cash flow hedges and foreign currency
    gains (losses) on the Company’s Euro-denominated debt
    designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its
    European subsidiaries.

Net
    Income per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing the
    net income applicable to common shares after preferred dividend
    requirements, if any, by the weighted-average number of common
    shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common
    shares include shares of the Company’s Class A and
    Class B common stock. Diluted net income per common share
    adjusts basic net income per common share for the effects of
    outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and any other potentially dilutive financial instruments,
    only in the periods in which such effect is dilutive under the
    treasury stock method.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to
    calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to
    those shares used in calculating diluted net income per common
    share as follows:

Options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
    greater than the average market price of the common stock during
    the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not
    included in the computation of diluted net income per common
    share. In addition, the Company has outstanding restricted stock
    units that are issuable only upon the achievement of certain
    service

and/or

performance goals. Performance-based restricted stock units are
    included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent
    that the underlying performance conditions (a) are
    satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or
    (b) would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period
    were the end of the related contingency period and the result
    would be dilutive under the treasury stock method. As of the end
    of Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, there was an
    aggregate of approximately 0.4 million, 1.2 million,
    and 3.5 million, respectively, of additional shares
    issuable upon the exercise of anti-dilutive options and the
    contingent vesting of restricted stock and performance-based
    restricted stock units that were excluded from the diluted share
    calculations.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company expenses all share-based payments to employees and
    non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the
    awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated
    forfeitures. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation method
    to determine the grant date fair value of its stock option
    awards.

See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation plans.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of 90 days or less, including
    investments in debt securities. Investments in debt securities
    are diversified among high-credit quality securities in
    accordance with the Company’s risk-management policies, and
    primarily include commercial paper and money market funds.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted
    Cash

From time to time, the Company is required to place cash in
    escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure
    guarantees of corresponding amounts made by the banks to
    international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as
    to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain
    international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain
    international tax audits. Such cash has been classified as
    restricted cash and reported as a component of either other
    current assets or non-current assets in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets.

Investments

Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company
    expects to convert into cash within one year, including time
    deposits, which have original maturities greater than
    90 days. Non-current investments consist of those
    investments which the Company does not expect to convert into
    cash within one year.

The Company classifies its investments in securities at the time
    of purchase as

held-to-maturity

or

available-for-sale,

and re-evaluates such classifications on a quarterly basis.

Held-to-maturity

investments consist of securities that the Company has the
    intent and ability to retain until maturity. These securities
    are recorded at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums
    and discounts, which approximates fair value.

Available-for-sale

investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or
    losses classified as a component of AOCI in the consolidated
    balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses classified
    as a component of interest and other income, net, in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and purchase of
    investments are classified as investing activities in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

Equity-method
    Investments

Investments in companies in which the Company has significant
    influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are
    accounted for using the equity method. This is generally
    presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of
    the investee. However, if the Company had a greater than 50%
    ownership interest in an investee and the noncontrolling
    shareholders held certain rights that allowed them to
    participate in the

day-to-day

operations of the business, the Company would also generally use
    the equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, only the Company’s investment in
    and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in
    the consolidated balance sheets; only the Company’s share
    of the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in the
    consolidated results of operations; and only the dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the investee
    and additional cash investments, loan repayments or other cash
    paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements
    of cash flows.

The Company’s investments include a joint venture named the
    Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL
    Watch Company”), formed with Compagnie Financiere Richemont
    SA (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group, in
    March 2007. The joint venture is a Swiss corporation whose
    purpose is to design, develop, manufacture, sell and distribute
    luxury watches and fine jewelry through Ralph Lauren boutiques,
    as well as through fine independent jewelry and luxury watch
    retailers throughout the world. The Company accounts for its 50%
    interest in the RL Watch Company under the equity method of
    accounting, and such investment is included in other non-current
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Royalty payments due
    to the Company under the related license agreement for use of
    certain of the Company’s trademarks are reflected as
    licensing revenue within the consolidated statements of
    operations.

Impairment
    Assessment

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss
    positions for

other-than-temporary

impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a
    variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and

F-10


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and
    distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors
    considered by the Company include (i) the length of time
    and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost,
    (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and
    near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time
    to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market
    forecasts, (v) the Company’s intent and ability to
    retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
    for recovery of market value, and (vi) an assessment of
    whether it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be
    required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.

See Note 16 for further information relating to the
    Company’s investments.

Accounts
    Receivable

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to
    customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts
    receivable, net, as shown in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets, is net of certain reserves and allowances. These
    reserves and allowances consist of (a) reserves for
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdowns and operational chargebacks and (b) allowances
    for doubtful accounts. These reserves and allowances are
    discussed in further detail below.

A reserve for sales returns is determined based on an evaluation
    of current market conditions and historical returns experience.
    Charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

A reserve for trade discounts is determined based on open
    invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers,
    and charges to increase the reserve are treated as reductions of
    revenue.

Estimated

end-of-season

markdown charges are included as reductions of revenue. The
    related markdown provisions are based on retail sales
    performance, seasonal negotiations with customers, historical
    and forecasted deduction trends, an evaluation of current
    economic and market conditions and, in certain cases,
    contractual terms.

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
    deductions by customers relating to individual shipments.
    Charges to increase this reserve, net of expected recoveries,
    are included as reductions of revenue. The reserve is based on
    actual notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and past
    experience.

markdowns and operational chargebacks is presented below:

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major
    department and specialty stores across the U.S., Canada, Europe
    and Asia, and extends credit based on an evaluation of each
    customer’s financial capacity and condition, usually
    without requiring collateral. In its wholesale business,
    concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the
    large number of customers and their dispersion across many
    geographic areas. However, the Company has four key wholesale
    customers that generate significant sales volume. For Fiscal
    2011, these customers in the aggregate contributed approximately
    40% of all wholesale revenues. Further, as of April 2,
    2011, the Company’s four key wholesale customers
    represented approximately 30% of gross accounts receivable.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold directly to consumers.
    Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost
    or estimated realizable value with cost primarily determined on
    a weighted-average cost basis.

The Company continuously evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning product and all fashion
    product. Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined
    based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the
    Company’s individual product lines, the impact of market
    trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders
    in-house relating to future sales of inventory. Estimates may
    differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of
    products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and
    market conditions. The Company’s historical estimates of
    these costs and its provisions have not differed materially from
    actual results.

Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over
    physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical
    experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture,
    fixtures, machinery and equipment, and computer software and
    equipment; and from ten to forty years for buildings and
    improvements. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the
    shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
    or the term of the lease.

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
    recoverability, including finite-lived intangibles as described
    below, the

F-12


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to
    result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
    To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
    attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between
    the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering
    external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed
    of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are
    reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs
    to sell.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value
    of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consist of
    license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete
    agreements and order backlog. The fair value of these intangible
    assets is estimated based on management’s assessment,
    considering independent third party appraisals, when necessary.
    The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of
    net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill, including
    any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain
    other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives
    are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually
    based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their
    carrying values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized
    over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with
    other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for
    impairment periodically whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may
    not be recoverable. See discussion of the Company’s
    accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as described
    earlier under the caption

“Property and Equipment,
    Net.”

Officers’
    Life Insurance Policies

The Company maintains certain split-dollar life insurance
    policies for select senior executives. These policies are
    recorded at the lesser of their cash-surrender value or
    aggregate premiums

paid-to-date

in the consolidated balance sheets. As of the end of both Fiscal
    2011 and Fiscal 2010, amounts of approximately $33 million
    relating to officers’ split-dollar life insurance policies
    held by the Company were classified within other non-current
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax
    expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in
    the current year and include the results of any difference
    between US GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect
    the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and
    general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of
    temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and
    liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as
    determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company
    accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or
    rates in the period of enactment.

In addition, valuation allowances are established when
    management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that some
    portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

In determining the income tax provision for financial reporting
    purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax
    positions. If the Company considers that a tax position is
    “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained upon audit,
    based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
    recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit
    by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax
    position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
    assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains
    assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the
    Company’s estimates change or the final tax outcome of
    these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such
    differences will impact the income tax provision in the period
    in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment
    fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company

F-13


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the
    tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or
    analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of
    prevailing on the technical merits of the position to
    “more-likely-than-not,” (ii) the statute of
    limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an
    audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the
    appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as
    current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the
    next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded
    within the provision for income taxes in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the
    consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company’s
    income taxes.

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment, including
    its retail stores. Certain of the Company’s leases contain
    renewal options, rent escalation clauses

and/or

landlord incentives. Rent expense for noncancelable operating
    leases with scheduled rent increases

and/or

landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement
    date. The excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled
    payment amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a
    deferred rent liability. As of the end of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal
    2010, deferred rent obligations of approximately
    $173 million and $148 million, respectively, were
    classified primarily within other non-current liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

In certain lease arrangements the Company is involved with the
    construction of the building (generally on land owned by the
    landlord). If the Company concludes that it has substantively
    all of the risks of ownership during construction of a leased
    property and therefore is deemed the owner of the project for
    accounting purposes, it records an asset and related financing
    obligation for the amount of total project costs related to

construction-in-progress

and the pre-existing building. Once construction is complete,
    the Company considers the requirements for sale-leaseback
    treatment, including the transfer back of all risks of ownership
    and whether the Company has any continuing involvement in the
    leased property. If the arrangement does not qualify for
    sale-leaseback treatment, the Company continues to amortize the
    financing obligation and depreciate the building over the lease
    term.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company records all derivative instruments on the
    consolidated balance sheets at fair value. In addition, for
    derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, the
    effective portion of changes in the fair value is either
    (a) offset against the changes in fair value of the hedged
    assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or
    (b) recognized in equity as a component of AOCI until the
    hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the
    derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash
    flows, respectively.

Each derivative instrument entered into by the Company which
    qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly
    effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
    being hedged. For each derivative designated as a hedge, the
    Company formally documents the risk management objective and
    strategy, including the identification of the hedging
    instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure, as well as
    how effectiveness is to be assessed prospectively and
    retrospectively. To assess the effectiveness of derivative
    instruments designated as hedges, the Company uses
    non-statistical methods, including the dollar-offset method,
    which compare the change in the fair value of the derivative to
    the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
    The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is
    expected to continue to be effective at achieving offsetting
    changes in fair value or cash flows is assessed and documented
    by the Company on at least a quarterly basis.

To the extent that a derivative contract designated as a cash
    flow hedge is not considered to be effective, any changes in
    fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately
    recognized in earnings within foreign currency gains (losses).
    If it is determined that a derivative has not been highly
    effective, and will continue not to be highly effective at
    hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is
    discontinued. If a hedge relationship is terminated, the change
    in fair value of the derivative previously recorded in AOCI is
    recognized when the hedged

F-14


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

item affects earnings consistent with the original hedging
    strategy, unless the forecasted transaction is no longer
    probable of occurring in which case the accumulated amount is
    immediately recognized in earnings.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is
    exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts
    will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
    counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only
    entering into contracts with carefully selected financial
    institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other
    financial factors, adhering to established limits for credit
    exposure. The Company’s established policies and procedures
    for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include
    continually reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of
    counterparties.

For cash flow reporting purposes, the Company classifies
    proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a
    derivative instrument in the same manner as the related item
    being hedged.

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company primarily enters into forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange
    rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty
    payments made by certain of its international operations,
    intercompany contributions to fund certain marketing efforts of
    its international operations, interest payments made in
    connection with outstanding debt and other foreign
    currency-denominated operational cash flows. To the extent
    foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow
    hedges at hedge inception are highly effective in offsetting the
    change in the value of the hedged item, the related gains
    (losses) are initially deferred in equity as a component of AOCI
    and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations as follows:

•

Forecasted Inventory Purchases

— Recognized as
    part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of
    goods sold when the related inventory is sold.

•

Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions

— Recognized within foreign currency gains
    (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or
    marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid.

•

Interest Payments on Euro Debt

— Recognized
    within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which
    the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency
    exchange remeasurement.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation

Changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument or a
    non-derivative financial instrument (such as debt) that is
    designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
    are reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment, to
    the extent it is effective as a hedge. In assessing the
    effectiveness of a non-derivative financial instrument that has
    been designated as a hedge of a net investment, the Company uses
    the spot rate method of accounting to value foreign currency
    exchange rate changes in both its foreign subsidiaries and the
    financial instrument. If the notional amount of the financial
    instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment is greater
    than the portion of the net investment being hedged, hedge
    ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings within
    foreign currency gains (losses). To the extent the financial
    instrument remains effective, changes in its fair value are
    recorded in equity as a component of AOCI until the sale or
    liquidation of the hedged net investment.

Fair
    Value Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that has
    been designated as a fair value hedge, along with offsetting
    changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the
    hedged risk, are recorded in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness is
    recorded in earnings to the extent that the change in the fair
    value of the hedged item does not offset the change in the fair
    value of the hedging instrument.

Undesignated
    Hedges

All of the Company’s undesignated hedges are entered into
    to hedge specific economic risks, such as foreign currency
    exchange rate risk. Changes in fair value of undesignated
    derivative instruments are immediately recognized in earnings
    within foreign currency gains (losses).

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued revised guidance for accounting for a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”), which has been
    codified within Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) topic 810, “Consolidation”
    (“ASC 810”). The revised guidance within ASC 810
    changes the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a
    VIE, replacing the quantitative-based risks and rewards approach
    with a qualitative approach that focuses on identifying which
    enterprise has (i) the power to direct the activities of a
    VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the
    right to receive benefits of the entity that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. ASC 810 also now requires
    ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE, as well as additional disclosures about an
    enterprise’s involvement in VIEs. The Company adopted the
    revised guidance for VIEs within ASC 810 as of the
    beginning of Fiscal 2011 (April 4, 2010). The adoption did
    not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Proposed
    Amendments to Current Accounting Standards

The FASB is currently working on amendments to existing
    accounting standards governing a number of areas including, but
    not limited to, accounting for leases. In August 2010, the FASB
    issued an exposure draft, “Leases” (the “Exposure
    Draft”), which would replace the existing guidance in ASC
    topic 840, “Leases.” Under the Exposure Draft, among
    other changes in practice, a lessee’s rights and
    obligations under all leases, including existing and new
    arrangements, would be recognized as assets and liabilities,
    respectively, on the balance sheet. Subsequent to the end of the
    related comment period, the FASB made several amendments to the
    exposure draft, including revising the definition of the
    “lease term” to include the non-cancelable lease term
    plus only those option periods for which there is significant
    economic incentive for the lessee to extend or not terminate the
    lease. The FASB also redefined the initial lease liability to be
    recorded on the Company’s balance sheet to contemplate only
    those variable lease payments that are in substance
    “fixed”. The final standard is expected to be issued
    in the second half of 2011. When and if effective, this proposed
    standard will likely have a significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, as
    the standard-setting process is still ongoing, the Company is
    unable to determine the impact this proposed change in
    accounting will have on its consolidated financial statements at
    this time.

Acquisitions

Fiscal
    2011 Transactions

South
    Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition

On January 1, 2011, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel and accessories business in South Korea
    (the “Polo South Korea business”) from a licensed to a
    wholly owned operation, the Company acquired certain net assets
    (including inventory) and employees from Doosan in exchange for
    an initial payment of approximately $25 million plus an
    additional aggregate payment of approximately $22 million
    (the “South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition”).
    Doosan was the Company’s licensee for the Polo South Korea
    business. The Company funded the South Korea Licensed Operations
    Acquisition with available cash on-hand. In conjunction with the
    South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition, the Company also
    entered into a transition services

F-16


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agreement with Doosan for the provision of certain financial and
    information systems services for a period of up to twelve months
    commencing on January 1, 2011.

The Company accounted for the South Korea Licensed Operations
    Acquisition as a business combination during the third quarter
    of Fiscal 2011. The acquisition cost of $47 million
    (excluding transaction costs) has been allocated to the net
    assets acquired based on their respective fair values as
    follows: inventory of $8 million; property and equipment of
    $7 million; customer relationship intangible asset of
    $26 million; non tax-deductible goodwill of
    $4 million; and other net assets of $2 million.
    Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    acquired. Transaction costs of $3 million were expensed as
    incurred and classified within SG&A expenses in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

The customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the
    excess earnings method. This approach discounts the estimated
    after tax cash flows associated with the existing base of
    customers as of the acquisition date, factoring in expected
    attrition of the existing customer base (the “Excess
    Earnings Method”). The customer relationship intangible
    asset is being amortized over its estimated useful life of ten
    years.

The operating results for the Polo South Korea business have
    been consolidated in the Company’s operating results
    commencing on January 1, 2011 and are reported on a
    one-month lag. The net effect of this reporting lag is not
    deemed to be material to the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Fiscal
    2010 Transactions

Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition

On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of
    the Polo-branded apparel business in Asia-Pacific (excluding
    Japan and South Korea) from a licensed to a wholly owned
    operation, the Company acquired certain net assets from Dickson
    Concepts International Limited and affiliates
    (“Dickson”) in exchange for an initial payment of
    approximately $20 million and other consideration of
    approximately $17 million (the “Asia-Pacific Licensed
    Operations Acquisition”). Dickson was the Company’s
    licensee for Polo-branded apparel in the Asia-Pacific region
    (excluding Japan and South Korea), which is comprised of China,
    Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
    Taiwan and Thailand. The Company funded the Asia-Pacific
    Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash on-hand.

The Company accounted for the Asia-Pacific Licensed Operations
    Acquisition as a business combination during the fourth quarter
    of Fiscal 2010. The acquisition cost of $37 million
    (excluding transaction costs) has been allocated to the net
    assets acquired based on their respective fair values as
    follows: inventory of $2 million; customer relationship
    intangible asset of $29 million; tax-deductible goodwill of
    $1 million and other net assets of $5 million.
    Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired. Transaction costs of $4 million were
    expensed as incurred and classified within SG&A expenses in
    the consolidated statement of operations.

The customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the
    Excess Earnings Method and is being amortized over its estimated
    useful life of ten years.

The operating results for the Polo-branded apparel business in
    Asia-Pacific have been consolidated in the Company’s
    operating results commencing on January 1, 2010.

Fiscal
    2009 Transactions

Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition

On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the
    Polo-branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan
    from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company
    acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai
    Co. Ltd. (“Naigai”) in exchange for a payment of
    approximately ¥2.8 billion

F-17


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(approximately $26 million as of the acquisition date) and
    certain other consideration (the “Japanese Childrenswear
    and Golf Acquisition”). The Company funded the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on-hand.
    Naigai was the Company’s licensee for childrenswear, golf
    apparel and hosiery under the Polo by Ralph Lauren and Ralph
    Lauren brands in Japan. In conjunction with the Japanese
    Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, the Company also entered
    into an additional

5-year

licensing and design-related agreement with Naigai for Polo and
    Chaps-branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services
    agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human
    resources and information systems-related services over a period
    of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the
    transaction.

The Company accounted for the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf
    Acquisition as an asset purchase during the second quarter of
    Fiscal 2009. Based on the results of valuation analyses
    performed, the Company allocated all of the consideration
    exchanged in the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition to
    the net assets acquired in connection with the transaction. No
    settlement loss associated with any pre-existing relationships
    was recognized. The acquisition cost of $28 million
    (including transaction costs of approximately $2 million)
    has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on their
    respective fair values as follows: inventory of
    $16 million; customer relationship intangible asset of
    $13 million; and other net liabilities of $1 million.

The operating results for the Polo-branded childrenswear and
    golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the
    Company’s operating results commencing August 2, 2008.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 3, goodwill and certain other
    intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not
    amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Finite-lived
    intangible assets continue to be amortized over their respective
    estimated useful lives. Based on the results of the
    Company’s annual impairment testing of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets in Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010
    and Fiscal 2009, no impairment charges were deemed necessary.

Impairments
    of Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be fully recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets
    for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future
    cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
    eventual disposition. To the extent that the estimated future
    undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less
    than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal
    to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and
    its fair value.

Fiscal
    2011 Impairment

During Fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment
    charge of $2.5 million to reduce the net carrying value of
    certain retail store and concession shop long-lived assets in
    the Asia-Pacific region that were determined to no longer be
    used over the intended service period to their estimated fair
    value, which was calculated based on discounted expected cash
    flows.

Fiscal
    2010 Impairment

During Fiscal 2010, the Company recorded non-cash impairment
    charges of $6.6 million to reduce the net carrying value of
    certain long-lived assets primarily in its Retail segment to
    their estimated fair value, which was determined based on
    discounted expected cash flows. This impairment charge was
    primarily related to the underperformance of certain domestic
    retail stores, largely related to the Company’s Club Monaco
    retail business.

Fiscal
    2009 Impairment

During Fiscal 2009, the Company recorded total non-cash
    impairment charges of $55.4 million to reduce the net
    carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated
    fair value, which was determined based on discounted expected
    cash flows. These impairment charges included a
    $52.0 million write-down of Retail store assets and a
    $3.4 million write-down of certain capitalized software
    costs (primarily in the Wholesale segment) that were determined
    to no longer be used over the intended service period. The
    Retail store asset impairment was associated with
    underperformance of certain

Ralph Lauren

and

full-price stores primarily located in the
    U.S. due in part to the significant contraction in consumer
    spending experienced during the latter half of Fiscal 2009.

Restructuring

The Company has recorded restructuring liabilities in recent
    years relating to various cost-savings initiatives, as well as
    certain of its acquisitions. Liabilities for restructuring costs
    are measured at fair value when incurred. A description of the
    nature of significant restructuring activities and related costs
    is presented below.

Fiscal
    2011 Restructuring

During Fiscal 2011, the Company recognized net restructuring
    charges of $2.6 million primarily related to employee
    termination costs associated with its wholesale operations and
    the closing of a warehouse facility, partially offset by
    reversals of reserves deemed no longer necessary largely
    associated with previously closed retail stores.

Fiscal
    2010 Restructuring

During Fiscal 2010, the Company recognized net restructuring
    charges of $6.9 million primarily related to employee
    termination costs, as well as the write-down of an asset
    associated with exiting a retail store in Japan.

Fiscal
    2009 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company initiated
    a restructuring plan designed to better align its cost base with
    the slowdown in consumer spending that negatively affected sales
    and operating margins and to improve overall operating
    effectiveness (the “Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan”).
    The Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan included the termination of
    approximately 500 employees and the closure of certain
    underperforming retail stores.

In connection with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, the
    Company recorded $20.8 million in restructuring charges
    during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009. The remaining
    restructuring liability as of April 2, 2011 and
    April 3, 2010 was $0.1 million and $1.1 million,
    respectively.

In addition to the restructuring charges incurred in connection
    with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan as discussed above, the
    Company recognized $2.8 million of other restructuring
    charges earlier in Fiscal 2009, primarily related to severance
    costs associated with the transition of certain sourcing and
    production facilities in Asia-Pacific.

(a)

Net current deferred tax balances
    as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010 included current
    deferred tax liabilities of $2.8 million and
    $2.4 million, respectively, recorded within accrued
    expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets.

(b)

Net non-current deferred tax
    balances as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010 were
    comprised of non-current deferred tax assets of
    $76.7 million and $101.9 million, respectively,
    included within deferred tax assets, and non-current deferred
    tax liabilities of $41.4 million and $30.5 million,
    respectively, recorded within other non-current liabilities in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has available state and foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards of $5.0 million and $43.7 million,
    respectively, for tax purposes to offset future taxable income.
    The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal
    2012.

Also, the Company has available state and foreign net operating
    loss carryforwards of $7.8 million and $67.9 million,
    respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been
    recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded since
    management does not believe that the Company will more likely
    than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future
    taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax
    assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such
    recognition. The valuation allowance relating to state and
    foreign net operating tax carryforwards increased
    $3.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, as a
    result of the Company’s inability to utilize certain state
    and foreign net operating tax carryforwards.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign
    taxes on $1.182 billion of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings have been and are expected
    to continue to be reinvested. These earnings could become
    subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign
    earnings were lent to PRLC, a subsidiary or a
    U.S. affiliate of PRLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries
    were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
    tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practical.
    Management believes that the amount of the additional taxes that
    might be payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if
    remitted, would be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax
    credits.

    2010 and was included within non-current liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated balance sheets.
    The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate
    was $110.8 million as of April 2, 2011 and
    $99.6 million as of April 3, 2010.

Future
    Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the
    Company’s tax positions is subject to change based on
    future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of
    ongoing audits

and/or

the
    expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the
    outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, the
    Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties,
    will change significantly during the next 12 months.
    However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes and timing
    of those events could cause the Company’s current estimate
    to change materially in the future.

The Company files tax returns in the U.S. federal and
    various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. With few
    exceptions for those tax returns, the Company is no longer
    subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for
    years prior to Fiscal 2004.

    October 4, 2013 (the “Euro Debt”). The Company
    has the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any
    time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a
    premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the
    outstanding Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest
    in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax
    law. Partial redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in
    either instance. In the event of a change of control of the
    Company, each holder of the Euro Debt has the option to require
    the Company to redeem

the Euro Debt at its principal amount plus accrued interest. The
    indenture governing the Euro Debt (the “Indenture”)
    contains certain limited covenants that restrict the
    Company’s ability, subject to specified exceptions, to
    incur liens or enter into a sale and leaseback transaction for
    any principal property. The Indenture does not contain any
    financial covenants.

In July 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer and used
    $121.0 million to repurchase €90.8 million of
    principal amount of its then outstanding €300 million
    principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 at
    a discounted purchase price of approximately 95%. A net pretax
    gain of $4.1 million related to this extinguishment of debt
    was recorded during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 and
    classified as a component of interest and other income, net in
    the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The
    Company used its cash on-hand to fund the debt extinguishment.

Refer to Note 16 for discussion of the designation of the
    Company’s Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries.

Revolving
    Credit Facilities

Global
    Credit Facility

On March 10, 2011, the Company entered into a new credit
    facility that provides for a $500 million senior unsecured
    revolving line of credit through March 2016 (the “Global
    Credit Facility”). The Global Credit Facility replaced the
    Company’s previous $450 million unsecured revolving
    line of credit scheduled to mature in November 2011. Key changes
    under the Global Credit Facility include:

•

an increase in the ability of the Company to expand its
    additional borrowing availability from $600 million under
    the previous facility to $750 million, subject to the
    agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
    facility to increase their commitments;

•

an increase in the margin over LIBOR paid by the Company on
    amounts drawn under the Global Credit Facility to
    112.5 basis points (subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings) from 25 basis points;

•

an increase in the commitment fee for the unutilized portion of
    the Global Credit Facility to 15 basis points (subject to
    adjustment based on the Company’s credit ratings) from
    7 basis points; and

•

an ability to denominate borrowings in currencies other than
    U.S. dollars, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and
    Japanese Yen.

Consistent with the previous facility, the Global Credit
    Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of April 2, 2011, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Global Credit Facility and the Company was
    contingently liable for $16.8 million of outstanding
    letters of credit.

U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings under the Global Credit
    Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, either at
    (a) a base rate, by reference to the greatest of:
    (i) the annual prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan
    Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time, (ii) the
    weighted-average overnight Federal funds rate plus 50 basis
    points, or (iii) the one-month London Interbank Offered
    Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 100 basis points; or
    (b) LIBOR, adjusted for the Federal Reserve Board’s
    Eurocurrency liabilities maximum reserve percentage, plus a
    spread of 112.5 basis points, subject to adjustment based
    on the Company’s credit ratings (“Adjusted
    LIBOR”). Foreign currency-denominated borrowings bear
    interest at Adjusted LIBOR, as described above. There are no
    mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of
    the Global Credit Facility.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Global Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay
    a commitment fee to the lenders under the Global Credit Facility
    in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee
    rate of 15 basis points under the terms of the Global
    Credit Facility is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

POLO

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that,
    among other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject
    to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens,
    sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other
    companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses
    that are not in a related line of business; make loans,
    advances, or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates;
    and make investments. The Global Credit Facility also requires
    the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to
    Consolidated EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”) of no
    greater than 3.75 as of the date of measurement for the four
    most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is
    defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding plus 8 times
    consolidated rent expense for the last four consecutive fiscal
    quarters. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as
    consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense,
    (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and
    amortization expense and (iv) consolidated rent expense. As
    of April 2, 2011, no Event of Default (as such term is
    defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred
    under the Company’s Global Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global
    Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate
    the Global Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding
    to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility
    specifies a number of events of default (many of which are
    subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others,
    the failure to make timely principal, interest and fee payments
    or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant
    described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility
    provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph
    Lauren, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
    and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a
    specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the
    Company’s common stock.

Chinese
    Credit Facility

On February 10, 2011, two of the Company’s
    subsidiaries, Polo Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., LTD and
    Polo Ralph Lauren Commerce and Trading (Shanghai) Co., LTD,
    entered into an uncommitted credit facility that provides for a
    revolving line of credit of up to 70 million Chinese
    Renminbi (approximately $10 million) through
    February 9, 2012 (the “Chinese Credit Facility”).
    The Chinese Credit Facility will be used to fund general working
    capital funding needs of the Company’s operations in China.
    The borrowing availability under the Chinese Credit Facility is
    at the sole discretion of JPMorgan Chase Bank (China) Company
    Limited, Shanghai Branch (the “Bank”) and is subject
    to availability of the Bank’s funds and satisfaction of
    certain regulatory requirements. Borrowings under the Chinese
    Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Polo Ralph Lauren
    Corporation and bear interest at either (i) at least 90% of
    the short-term interest rate published by the People’s Bank
    of China or (ii) a rate determined by the Bank at its
    discretion based on prevailing market conditions. As of
    April 2, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under
    the Chinese Credit Facility.

Fair
    Value of Debt

Based on the prevailing level of market interest rates as of
    April 2, 2011, the fair value of the Company’s Euro
    Debt exceeded its carrying value by approximately
    $13 million. As of April 3, 2010, the fair value of
    the Euro Debt exceeded its carrying value by approximately
    $10 million. Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not
    result in the realization or expenditure of cash, unless the
    debt is retired prior to its maturity.

15.

Fair
    Value Measurements

US GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for
    disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the
    applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular asset or
    liability depends on the inputs used in valuation as of the
    measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are
    market-based (observable) or internally derived (unobservable).
    The three levels are defined as follows:

•

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets.

F-28


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets for substantially the full term of
    the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the
    full term of the financial instrument; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are
    observable.

•

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques
    that are significant to the fair value measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the
    valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that
    is significant to the fair value measurement.

securities and recorded at fair value in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets based upon quoted market prices in
    active markets.

The Company’s auction rate securities are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and recorded at fair value in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. Third-party pricing institutions
    may value auction rate securities at par, which may not
    necessarily reflect prices that would be obtained in the current
    market. When quoted market prices are unobservable, fair value
    is estimated based on a number of known factors and external
    pricing data, including known maturity dates, the coupon rate
    based upon the most recent reset market clearing rate, the
    price/yield representing the average rate of recently successful
    traded securities, and the total principal balance of each
    security.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are valued
    using a pricing model, primarily based on market observable
    external inputs including forward and spot rates for foreign
    currencies, which considers the impact of the Company’s own
    credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are
    considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments
    classified as

held-to-maturity

and accounts receivable are recorded at carrying value, which
    approximates fair value. The Company’s Euro Debt, which is
    adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the

and investments in equity method investees are also reported at
    carrying value. However, other than differences in the fair
    value of the Company’s fixed rate debt as disclosed in
    Note 14, the differences between fair value and carrying
    value were not significant as of April 2, 2011 or
    April 3, 2010.

The Company’s non-financial instruments, which primarily
    consist of goodwill, intangible assets, and property and
    equipment, are not required to be measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, on
    a periodic basis whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable
    (and at least annually for goodwill), non-financial instruments
    are assessed for impairment and, if applicable, written-down to
    and recorded at fair value, considering external market
    participant assumptions.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company is primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows from
    its international operations and potential declines in the value
    of reported net assets of certain of its foreign operations, as
    well as changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt
    relating to changes in interest rates. Consequently, the Company
    periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage
    such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative
    transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

Foreign currency gains (losses

)

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that approximately
    $11 million of net losses deferred in AOCI related to
    derivative financial instruments outstanding as of April 2,
    2011 will be recognized in earnings. No material gains or losses
    relating to ineffective or discontinued hedges were recognized
    during any of the fiscal years presented.

The following is a summary of the Company’s risk management
    strategies and the effect of those strategies on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Forward
    Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company primarily enters into forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange
    rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty
    payments made by certain of its international operations,
    intercompany contributions to fund certain marketing efforts of
    its international operations, interest payments made in
    connection with outstanding debt and other foreign
    currency-denominated operational cash flows. As part of its
    overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of
    foreign currency

F-31


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of
    the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Swiss
    Franc, and the British Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a
    portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the
    ensuing twelve-month to two-year periods. In doing so, the
    Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts that
    generally have maturities of three months to two years to
    provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company designated the entire principal amount of its
    outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries. To the extent this hedge
    remains effective, changes in the value of the Euro Debt
    resulting from fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate will
    continue to be reported in equity as a component of AOCI.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

Interest
    Rate Swap Contracts

During the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company entered
    into a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to mitigate
    its exposure to changes in the fair value of the Company’s
    Euro Debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The
    interest rate swap, which has a maturity date of October 4,
    2013, has an aggregate notional value of
    €209.2 million and swaps the 4.5% fixed interest rate
    on the Company’s Euro Debt for a variable interest rate
    equal to the

3-month

Euro
    Interbank Offered Rate plus 299 basis points. The
    Company’s interest rate swap meets the requirements for
    shortcut method accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair
    value of the interest rate swap are exactly offset by changes in
    the fair value of the Euro Debt. No ineffectiveness has been
    recorded during Fiscal 2011.

On April 11, 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate
    swap, the impact of which is not expected to have a material
    impact on its consolidated financial statements.

See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company’s
    accounting policies relating to its derivative and other
    financial instruments.

Held-to-maturity

investments consist of debt securities that the Company has the
    intent and ability to retain until maturity. These securities
    are recorded at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums
    and discounts, which approximates fair value.

Available-for-sale

investments primarily consist of municipal bonds, VRMS and
    auction rate securities. VRMS represent long-term municipal
    bonds with interest rates that reset at pre-determined
    short-term intervals, and can typically be put to the issuer and
    redeemed for cash upon demand, or shortly thereafter. Auction
    rate securities also have characteristics similar to short-term
    investments. However, the Company has classified these
    securities as non-current investments in its consolidated
    balance sheets as current market conditions call into question
    its ability to redeem these investments for cash within the next
    twelve months. No material unrealized or realized gains or
    losses on

available-for-sale

investments were recorded during any of the fiscal periods
    presented.

The Company did not recognize any

other-than-temporary

impairment charges in any of the fiscal years presented.

See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company’s
    accounting policies relating to investments.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

The Company operates its retail stores under various leasing
    arrangements. The Company also occupies various office and
    warehouse facilities and uses certain equipment under numerous
    lease agreements. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for as
    either operating leases or capital leases. In this context,
    capital leases include

F-33


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

leases whereby the Company is considered to have the substantive
    risks of ownership during construction of a leased property.
    Information on the Company’s operating and capital leasing
    activities is set forth below.

Operating
    Leases

The Company is typically required to make minimum rental
    payments, and often contingent rental payments, under its
    operating leases. Many of the Company’s factory and
    full-price retail store leases provide for contingent rentals
    based upon sales, and certain rental agreements require payment
    based solely on a percentage of sales. Terms of the
    Company’s leases generally contain renewal options, rent
    escalation clauses and landlord incentives. Rent expense, net of
    sublease income which was not significant, was approximately
    $317 million in Fiscal 2011, $267 million in Fiscal
    2010 and $237 million in Fiscal 2009. Such amounts include
    contingent rental charges of approximately $89 million for
    Fiscal 2011, $74 million for Fiscal 2010 and
    $51 million for Fiscal 2009. In addition to such amounts,
    the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and
    occupancy costs relating to the leased real estate properties.

As of April 2, 2011, future minimum rental payments under
    noncancelable operating leases with lease terms in excess of one
    year were as follows:

    net of accumulated amortization of $11 million and

    property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets. As of

Employment
    Agreements

The Company has employment agreements with certain executives in
    the normal course of business which provide for compensation and
    certain other benefits. These agreements also provide for
    severance payments under certain circumstances.

Other
    Commitments

Other off-balance sheet firm commitments, which primarily
    include inventory purchase commitments, marketing and
    advertising commitments, outstanding letters of credit and
    minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to
    approximately $1.053 billion as of April 2, 2011.

Litigation

California
    Class Action Litigation

On October 11, 2007 and November 2, 2007, two class
    action lawsuits were filed by two customers in state court in
    California asserting that while they were shopping at certain of
    the Company’s factory stores in California, the Company
    allegedly required them to provide certain personal information
    at the

point-of-sale

in order to complete a credit card purchase. The plaintiffs
    purported to represent a class of customers in California who
    allegedly were injured by being forced to provide their address
    and telephone numbers in order to use their credit cards to
    purchase items from the Company’s stores, which allegedly
    violated Section 1747.08 of California’s Song-Beverly
    Act. The complaints sought an unspecified amount of statutory
    penalties, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. The
    Company subsequently had the actions moved to the United States
    District Court for the Eastern and Central Districts of
    California. Subsequently, the parties agreed to settle these
    claims by agreeing that the Company would issue $20 merchandise
    discount coupons with six month expiration dates to eligible
    parties and would pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.
    In connection with this settlement, the Company recorded a
    $5 million reserve against its expected loss exposure
    during the second quarter of Fiscal 2009. The terms of the
    settlement were later approved by the Court. Accordingly, the
    coupons were issued in February 2010 and expired on
    August 16, 2010. Based on the coupon redemption experience,
    the Company reversed $1.7 million of its original
    $5.0 million reserve into income during Fiscal 2010, and
    the remaining $1.9 million of reserves was reversed into
    income during Fiscal 2011.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd.
    (“Wathne”), Polo’s then domestic licensee for
    luggage and handbags, filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York
    against the Company and Ralph Lauren, its Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, asserting, among other things, federal
    trademark law violations, breach of contract, breach of
    obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
    misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other relief,
    injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
    New York County, making substantially the same allegations
    and claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the court granted the
    Company’s motion to dismiss all of the causes of action,
    including the cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except
    for breach of contract related claims, and denied Wathne’s
    motion for a preliminary injunction. Following some discovery,
    the Company moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims.
    Wathne cross-moved for partial summary judgment. In an
    April 11, 2008 Decision and Order, the court granted
    Polo’s summary judgment motion to dismiss most of the
    claims against the Company, and denied Wathne’s
    cross-motion for summary judgment. Wathne appealed the dismissal
    of its claims to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.
    Following a hearing on May 19, 2009, the Appellate Division
    issued a Decision and Order on June 9, 2009 which, in large
    part, affirmed the lower court’s ruling. Discovery on those
    claims that were not dismissed is ongoing and a trial date has
    not yet been set. The Company intends to continue to

contest the remaining claims in this lawsuit vigorously.
    Management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this
    matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial statements.

California
    Labor Litigation

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of the
    Company’s Ralph Lauren stores in Palo Alto and
    San Francisco, California filed a lawsuit in the
    San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations of
    California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs purported to
    represent a class of employees who allegedly had been injured by
    not properly being paid commission earnings, not being paid
    overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to work off of
    the clock while waiting to enter or leave stores and being
    falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave stores. The complaint
    sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, damages
    for emotional distress, disgorgement of profits, punitive
    damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive and declaratory
    relief. Subsequent to answering the complaint, the Company had
    the action moved to the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California. On July 8, 2008, the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California granted plaintiffs’ motion for class
    certification and subsequently denied the Company’s motion
    to decertify the class. On November 5, 2008, the District
    Court stayed litigation of the rest break claims pending the
    resolution of a separate California Supreme Court case on the
    standards of class treatment for rest break claims. On
    January 25, 2010, the District Court granted
    plaintiffs’ motion to sever the rest break claims from the
    rest of the case and denied the Company’s motion to
    decertify the waiting time claims. The District Court also
    ordered that a trial be held on the waiting time and overtime
    claims, which commenced on March 8, 2010. During trial, the
    parties reached an agreement to settle all of the claims in the
    litigation, including the rest break claims, for
    $4 million. The District Court granted preliminary approval
    of the settlement on May 21, 2010. Class members had
    60 days from the date of preliminary approval to submit
    claims or object to the settlement. Only a single objection to
    the settlement was received from one former employee. The Court
    dismissed the objection and granted final approval of the
    settlement on August 27, 2010. In connection with this
    settlement, the Company recorded a $4 million reserve
    against its expected loss exposure during the fourth quarter of
    Fiscal 2010.

Other
    Matters

The Company is otherwise involved, from time to time, in
    litigation, other legal claims and proceedings involving matters
    associated with or incidental to its business, including, among
    other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and
    other intellectual property, licensing, and employee relations.
    The Company believes that the resolution of currently pending
    matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a
    material adverse effect on its financial statements. However,
    the Company’s assessment of the current litigation or other
    legal claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not
    presently known or determinations by judges, juries or other
    finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s
    evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such
    litigation or claims.

Equity

Capital
    Stock

The Company’s capital stock consists of two classes of
    common stock. There are 500 million shares of Class A
    common stock and 100 million shares of Class B common
    stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and
    Class B common stock have substantially identical rights,
    except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A
    common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of
    Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share.
    Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class
    on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval,
    except with respect to the election and removal of directors or
    as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares
    of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and entities
    controlled by the Lauren family and are convertible at any time
    into shares of Class A common stock on a

Secondary
    Stock Offering

On June 14, 2010, the Company commenced a secondary public
    offering under which approximately 10 million shares of
    Class A common stock were sold on behalf of its principal
    stockholder, Mr. Lauren (the “Offering”). The
    Offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on

Form S-3

filed on the same day, and closed on June 24, 2010.
    Concurrent with the Offering, the Company also purchased an
    additional 1.0 million shares of Class A common stock
    under its repurchase program from Mr. Lauren at a cost of
    $81 million, representing the per share price of the public
    offering.

Class B
    Common Stock Conversion

In connection with the Offering and share repurchase discussed
    above, during the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, Mr. Lauren
    converted approximately 11 million shares of Class B
    common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A
    common stock pursuant to the terms of the security.
    Mr. Lauren also converted an additional 0.3 million
    shares of Class B common stock into an equal number of
    shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the
    security. During Fiscal 2010, Mr. Lauren converted
    1.2 million shares of Class B common stock into an
    equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to
    the terms of the security. These transactions resulted in a
    reclassification within equity, and had no effect on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

During Fiscal 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved an expansion of the Company’s existing stock
    repurchase program allowing the Company to repurchase up to an
    additional $775 million in Class A common stock,
    $275 million of which was approved on May 18, 2010,
    $250 million of which was approved on August 5, 2010,
    and $250 million of which was approved on February 8,
    2011. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are
    subject to overall business and market conditions.

In Fiscal 2011, 6.0 million shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of
    $577.8 million under its repurchase program, including a
    repurchase of 1.0 million shares of Class A common
    stock at a cost of $81.0 million in connection with the
    secondary stock offering discussed above. The remaining
    availability under the Company’s common stock repurchase
    program was $472.0 million as of April 2, 2011. In
    addition, during Fiscal 2011, 0.2 million shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of $16.8 million were
    surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of
    withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards
    issued under the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive
    Plan, as amended (the “1997 Incentive Plan”).

In Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of
    $215.9 million under its repurchase program. In addition,
    0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost
    of $15.1 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the
    Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with
    the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Plan.

In Fiscal 2009, 1.8 million shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of
    $126.2 million. Also, during the first quarter of Fiscal
    2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of Fiscal
    2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. In addition,
    in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of Class A common
    stock at a cost of $19.6 million were surrendered to, or
    withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in
    connection with the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Plan.

Repurchased and surrendered shares are accounted for as treasury
    stock at cost and will be held in treasury for future use.

On May 24, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a further expansion of the Company’s existing
    common stock repurchase program that will allow it to repurchase
    up to an additional $500 million of Class A common
    stock.

Long-term
    Stock Incentive Plans

On August 5, 2010, the Company’s shareholders approved
    the 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the “2010
    Incentive Plan”), which replaced the Company’s 1997
    Incentive Plan. The 2010 Incentive Plan provides for up to
    3.0 million of new shares authorized for issuance to
    participants, in addition to the shares that remained available
    for issuance under the 1997 Incentive Plan as of August 5,
    2010 that are not subject to outstanding awards under the 1997
    Incentive Plan. In addition, any outstanding awards under the
    1997 Incentive Plan that expire, are forfeited, or are
    surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes, will be
    transferred to the 2010 Incentive Plan

and be available for issuance. The 2010 Incentive Plan became
    effective immediately and no further grants will be made under
    the 1997 Incentive Plan. Outstanding awards as of August 5,
    2010 will continue to remain subject to the terms of the 1997
    Incentive Plan.

Under both the 2010 Incentive Plan and the 1997 Incentive Plan
    (the “Plans”), there are limits as to the number of
    shares available for certain awards and to any one participant.
    Equity awards that may be made under the Plans include, but are
    not limited to (a) stock options, (b) restricted stock
    and (c) restricted stock units (“RSUs”).

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of
    the Company’s unrestricted Class A common stock on the
    date of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable ratably
    (a graded-vesting schedule) over a three-year vesting period.
    Stock options generally expire seven years from the date of
    grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for
    share-based awards that have graded vesting and no performance
    conditions on an accelerated basis. The Company uses the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of
    stock options granted, which requires the input of both
    subjective and objective assumptions as follows:

Expected Term

— The estimate of expected term
    is based on the historical exercise behavior of employees and
    non-employee directors, as well as the contractual life of the
    option grants.

Expected Volatility

— The expected volatility
    factor is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock for a period equal to the stock
    option’s expected term.

Expected Dividend Yield

— The expected dividend
    yield is based on the Company’s quarterly cash dividend of
    (a) $0.05 per share for grants made prior to the third
    quarter of Fiscal 2010, (b) $0.10 per share for grants made
    during and after the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, but prior to
    the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, and (c) $0.20 per share
    for grants made during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.

Risk-free Interest Rate

— The risk-free
    interest rate is determined using the implied yield for a traded
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the
    option’s expected term.

Restricted
    Stock and RSUs

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based RSUs to certain of its senior executives
    and non-employee directors. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based RSUs to such senior executives and other key
    executives, as well as certain other employees of the Company.

Restricted shares of Class A common stock, which entitle
    the holder to receive a specified number of shares of
    Class A common stock at the end of a vesting period, are
    accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. In addition,
    holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash
    dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the
    Company’s Class A common stock. Restricted stock
    shares granted to non-employee directors vest over a three-year
    period of time.

RSUs entitle the grantee to receive shares of Class A
    common stock at the end of a vesting period. Service-based RSUs
    are payable in shares of Class A common stock and generally
    vest over a five-year period of time, subject to the
    executive’s continuing employment. Performance-based RSUs
    also are payable in shares of Class A common stock and
    generally vest (a) upon the completion of a three-year
    period of time (cliff vesting), subject to the employee’s
    continuing employment and the Company’s achievement of
    certain performance goals over the three-year period or
    (b) ratably, over a three-year period of time (graded
    vesting), subject to the employee’s continuing employment
    during the applicable vesting period and the achievement by the
    Company of certain performance goals in the initial year of the
    three-year vesting period. In addition, holders of certain RSUs
    are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the form of
    additional RSUs in connection with the payment of dividends on
    the Company’s Class A common stock. RSUs, including
    shares resulting from dividend equivalents paid on such units,
    are accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. The fair
    value of a restricted security is based on the fair value of
    unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect
    the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that
    are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense
    for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the related
    service period when attainment of the performance goals is
    deemed probable.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Profit
    Sharing Retirement Savings Plans

The Company sponsors three defined contribution benefit plans
    covering substantially all eligible employees in the
    U.S. and Puerto Rico who are not covered by a collective
    bargaining agreement. The plans include a savings plan feature
    under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The
    Company makes discretionary contributions to the plans and
    contributes an amount equal to 50% of the first 6% of salary
    contributed by an employee.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is 100% vested in
    Company matching and discretionary contributions after five
    years of credited service. Contributions made by the Company
    under these plans approximated $8 million in Fiscal 2011
    and $6 million in each of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009.

International
    Defined Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit
    plans and cash balance plans at international locations which
    are not considered to be material individually or in the
    aggregate. Pension benefits under these plans are based on
    formulas that reflect the employees’ years of service and
    compensation levels during their employment period. The
    aggregate funded status of the single-employer defined benefit
    plans were net liabilities of $1.7 million and
    $5.1 million as of April 2, 2011 and April 3,
    2010, respectively, and were primarily recorded within other
    non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. These single-employer defined benefit plans had
    aggregate projected benefit obligations of $33.6 million
    and aggregate fair values of plan assets of $31.9 million
    as of April 2, 2011, compared to projected benefit
    obligations of $25.4 million and aggregate fair values of
    plan assets of $22.5 million as of April 3, 2010. The
    asset portfolio of the single-employer defined benefit plans
    primarily consists of debt securities, which have been measured
    at fair value largely using Level 2 inputs, as defined in
    Note 15. Pension expense for these plans, recorded within
    SG&A expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations, was $1.8 million in Fiscal 2011,
    $4.2 million in Fiscal 2010 and $4.0 million in Fiscal
    2009.

Union
    Pension Plan

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is
    required to make contributions to the UNITE HERE (which was
    previously known as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
    Textile Employees, prior to its merger with the Hotel Employees
    and Restaurant Employees International Union)
    (“Union”) for dues based on wages paid to union
    employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to
    a retirement fund which provides defined benefits to
    substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not
    participate in the management of the plan and has not been
    furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits
    provided, vested and non-vested benefits or assets.

F-42


POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a
    multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its
    proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits.
    Such liability was assumed in conjunction with the acquisition
    of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee. The Company
    has no current intention of withdrawing from the plan.

Other
    Compensation Plans

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for
    certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the
    401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans were expected to
    be constrained by the operation of certain Internal Revenue Code
    limitations. These supplemental benefits vest over time and the
    related compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period. Effective August 2008, the Company amended this plan,
    resulting in a suspension of the annual contributions for
    substantially all plan participants. Further, affected
    participants were provided with a one-time election to either
    withdraw all benefits vested in the plan in a lump sum amount or
    remain in the plan and receive future distributions of benefits
    vested over a three-year period. In connection with this
    one-time election, the Company paid out approximately
    $18 million to affected participants during the first
    quarter of Fiscal 2010. Excluding amounts accrued for the
    one-time withdrawal payout noted above, amounts accrued under
    this plan totaled $9 million and $10 million as of
    April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, respectively, and
    were classified within other non-current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense
    recognized related to these benefits was $0.2 million in
    both Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 and $2 million in Fiscal
    2009.

Additionally, the Company has deferred compensation arrangements
    for certain key executives which generally provide for payments
    upon retirement, death or termination of employment. The amounts
    accrued under these plans were approximately $2 million and
    $1 million as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010,
    respectively, and were classified within other non-current
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Total
    compensation expense related to these compensation arrangements
    was $0.3 million in each of the three fiscal years
    presented. The Company funds a portion of these obligations
    through the establishment of trust accounts on behalf of the
    executives participating in the plans. The trust accounts are
    classified within other assets in the consolidated balance
    sheets.

22.

Segment
    Information

The Company has three reportable segments based on its business
    activities and organization: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.
    Such segments offer a variety of products through different
    channels of distribution. The Wholesale segment consists of
    women’s, men’s and children’s apparel,
    accessories, home furnishings, and related products which are
    sold to major department stores, specialty stores, golf and pro
    shops and the Company’s owned and licensed retail stores in
    the U.S. and overseas. The Retail segment consists of the
    Company’s worldwide retail operations, which sell products
    through its full-price and factory stores, its concessions-based
    shop-within-shops, as well as RalphLauren.com, Rugby.com and
    RalphLauren.co.uk, its

e-commerce

websites. The stores, concessions-based shop-within-shops and
    websites sell products purchased from the Company’s
    licensees, suppliers and Wholesale segment. The Licensing
    segment generates revenues from royalties earned on the sale of
    the Company’s apparel, home and other products
    internationally and domestically through licensing alliances.
    The licensing agreements grant the licensees rights to use the
    Company’s various trademarks in connection with the
    manufacture and sale of designated products in specified
    geographical areas for specified periods.

The accounting policies of the Company’s segments are
    consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3. Sales and
    transfers between segments generally are recorded at cost and
    treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are
    eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating
    segment performance. Each segment’s performance is
    evaluated based upon operating income before restructuring
    charges and certain other one-time items, such as legal charges,
    if any. Corporate overhead expenses (exclusive of certain
    expenses for senior management, overall branding-related
    expenses and certain other corporate-related expenses) are
    allocated to the segments based upon specific usage or other
    allocation methods.

Related
    Party Transactions

In the ordinary course of conducting its business, the Company
    periodically enters into transactions with other entities or
    people that are considered related parties.

In connection with the launch of the RL Watch Company business,
    the Company receives royalty payments pursuant to a related
    licensing agreement that allows the RL Watch Company to sell
    luxury watches and fine jewelry throughout the world using
    certain of the Company’s trademarks. The Company has a 50%
    interest in the RL Watch Company, which is accounted for under
    the equity method of accounting. Royalty payments received under
    this arrangement were less than $0.1 million in each of the
    fiscal years presented. See Note 3 for further discussion
    of the Company’s investment in the RL Watch Company.

During Fiscal 2011, the Company commenced a secondary public
    offering under which approximately 10 million shares of
    Class A common stock were sold on behalf of its principal
    stockholder, Mr. Ralph Lauren, Chairman of the Board and
    Chief Executive Officer. Concurrent with this offering, the
    Company also purchased an additional 1 million shares of
    Class A common stock under its repurchase program from
    Mr. Lauren at the per share price of the public offering.
    See Note 18 for further discussion of this secondary stock

MANAGEMENT’S
    RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation is responsible
    for the preparation, objectivity and integrity of the
    consolidated financial statements and other information
    contained in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial
    statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States and
    include some amounts that are based on management’s
    informed judgments and best estimates.

These consolidated financial statements have been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP in Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010 and
    Fiscal 2009, which is an independent registered public
    accounting firm. They conducted their audits in accordance with

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which oversees
    all of the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf
    of the Board of Directors, consists solely of independent
    directors, meets with the independent registered accountants,
    internal auditors and management periodically to review their
    respective activities and the discharge of their respective
    responsibilities. Both the independent registered public
    accountants and the internal auditors have unrestricted access
    to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss
    the scope and results of their audits and any recommendations
    regarding the system of internal controls.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of April 2, 2011 and April 3,
    2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended April 2, 2011. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of the Company at April 2, 2011 and
    April 3, 2010, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years
    in the period ended April 2, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 2, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated May 26, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and
    subsidiaries’ (the “Company’s”) internal
    control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2011, based
    on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
    criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report of
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of Internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition,
    which is included in the 2011 consolidated financial statements
    of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries and
    constituted 2% of total assets as of April 2, 2011 and less
    than 1% of revenues and net income for the year then ended. Our
    audit of internal control over financial reporting of Polo Ralph
    Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries also did not include an
    evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of
    the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 2, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of April 2,
    2011 and April 3, 2010, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended April 2, 2011 and our
    report dated May 26, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.
