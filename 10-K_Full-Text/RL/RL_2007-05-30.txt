PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global leader in the design,
    marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products
    including men’s, women’s and children’s apparel,
    accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. We believe that
    our global reach, breadth of product and multi-channel
    distribution is unique among luxury and apparel companies. We
    operate in three distinct but integrated segments: Wholesale,
    Retail and Licensing. During the past five years, we have
    continued to develop our business model, expand our vertically
    integrated Retail segment, reposition our Wholesale segment, and
    maintain a strong Licensing segment despite the strategic
    acquisition of several of our key licensed businesses. The
    following tables show our net revenues and operating profit
    (excluding unallocated corporate expenses and legal and
    restructuring charges) by segment for the last three fiscal
    years:

We continue to invest in our business. In the past five years,
    we have invested approximately $1.6 billion for the
    acquisition of several key licensed businesses and capital
    improvements, all fundamentally through strong operating cash
    flow. We intend to continue to execute our long-term strategy of
    expanding our accessories and other product offerings, growing
    our specialty retail store base, and expanding our presence
    internationally.

Seasonality
    of Business

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with greater
    Wholesale segment sales in our second and fourth quarters and
    greater Retail segment sales in our second and third quarters.
    These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal
    wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back to school and
    holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment. As a result of
    the growth in our retail operations and other changes in our
    business, historical quarterly operating trends and working
    capital requirements may not be indicative of future
    performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating
    income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by, among other
    things, the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other
    events affecting retail sales.

Recent
    Developments

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, we completed our tender offer which was
    commenced on April 17, 2007, in an effort to acquire in Yen
    the approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of Impact 21
    Co., Ltd (“Impact 21”), a Japanese corporation, that
    we did not previously own (the “Tender Offer”). Impact
    21 is our

sub-licensee

for men’s, women’s and jeans apparel and accessories
    in Japan. The successful completion of the Tender Offer allows
    us to enhance and expand our market distribution and product
    assortment in Japan, which is consistent with our overall
    objectives to grow our business internationally.

As part of the Tender Offer, Onward Kashiyama Co. Ltd
    (“Onward Kashiyama”) and its affiliates sold their
    approximately 41% ownership interest in Impact 21 to us. We also
    acquired approximately 36% of the issued and outstanding shares
    of Impact 21 held by the public, resulting in a total ownership
    level of approximately 97%. Under Japanese law, once we own
    two-thirds (2/3) or more of the aggregate voting rights of
    Impact 21, we would effectively control Impact 21 and may
    determine almost all matters subject to a vote of the
    shareholders of the Company. We intend to acquire the remaining
    approximately 3% of Impact 21’s shares not tendered as of
    May 29, 2007 and held by Impact 21’s remaining
    shareholders for cash during the second quarter of Fiscal 2008.
    The total acquisition cost (excluding transaction costs) to
    acquire the approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of
    Impact 21 not already owned by us is expected to be
    approximately $340 million. Of this amount, we paid
    approximately $327 million as of May 29, 2007 in
    conjunction with the completion of the Tender Offer. We will
    finance the total acquisition cost using cash on hand and an
    approximate $170 million short-term loan provided to us by
    several financial institutions (the “Term Loan”). We
    expect to repay the borrowings under the Term Loan using cash
    available at Impact 21 within the next 12 months. See
    Item 7 —

“Financial Condition and
    Liquidity”

for further discussion of the Term Loan.

The results of operations for Impact 21 will be consolidated as
    of April 1, 2007, the beginning of the annual fiscal period
    in which effective control was obtained for accounting purposes.
    We will report minority interest for


the amount of Impact 21’s net income allocable to the
    holders of the approximately 3% of Impact 21 shares not
    owned by us prior to May 29, 2007. In connection with the
    Tender Offer, we and Onward Kashiyama entered into a transition
    services agreement for Onward Kashiyama to provide a variety of
    operational, distribution and human resource-related services
    over a period of up to 2 years effective upon consummation
    of the Tender Offer. In addition, we will lease certain
    facilities from Onward Kashiyama.

Also on May 29, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (“PRL
    Japan”), a Japanese corporation, which was held by Onward
    Kashiyama and The Seibu Department Stores, Ltd.
    (“Seibu”). PRL Japan is our Japanese master licensee.
    We acquired PRL Japan for approximately $22 million in
    cash, excluding transaction costs, using cash on hand. We
    previously consolidated the results of PRL Japan as the primary
    beneficiary. As a result, commencing on May 29, 2007, we
    will report 100% of the net income of PRL Japan.

Acquisition
    of Small Leathergoods Business

On April 13, 2007, we acquired from Kellwood Company
    (“Kellwood”) substantially all of the assets of New
    Campaign, Inc., our licensee for men’s and women’s
    belts and other small leather goods under the Ralph Lauren,
    Lauren and Chaps brands in the U.S. The assets acquired
    from Kellwood will become a division of ours which has been
    renamed “Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods.” The asset
    purchase cost was approximately $10 million and is subject
    to customary closing adjustments. Under a transition services
    agreement, Kellwood will provide us with various transition
    services for up to six months after consummation of the asset
    purchase transaction.

The results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods
    business will be consolidated in our results of operations
    commencing in Fiscal 2008.

Acquisition
    of RL Media Minority Interest

On March 28, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50% equity
    interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (“RL Media”) held
    37.5% by NBC-Lauren Media Holdings, Inc. (a subsidiary
    wholly-owned by the National Broadcasting Company, Inc.) and
    12.5% by Value Vision Media, Inc. (“Value Vision”),
    giving us full ownership of RL Media. Commencing in Fiscal 2008,
    we will report 100% of the net income of RL Media. RL Media was
    established in 2000 to develop Polo Ralph Lauren branded media
    projects across multiple platforms. Today, RL Media conducts our

e-commerce

initiatives through the Polo.com internet site and is
    consolidated by us as the primary beneficiary. The acquisition
    was a cash transaction of $175 million.

Formation
    of Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Joint Venture

On March 5, 2007, we announced that we had agreed to form a
    joint venture with Financiere Richemont SA
    (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group. The

50-50

joint
    venture will be a Swiss corporation (or société à
    responsabilité limitee) named the Ralph Lauren Watch and
    Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L., (the “RL Watch Company”)
    and the joint venture’s purpose is to design, develop,
    manufacture, sell and distribute luxury watches and fine jewelry
    through Ralph Lauren boutiques, as well as through fine
    independent jewelry and luxury watch retailers throughout the
    world. The RL Watch Company is expected to commence operations
    during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008 and it is expected that
    the products will be launched in the fall of calendar 2008. We
    expect to account for our 50% interest in the RL Watch Company
    under the equity method of accounting. Royalty payments due to
    us under the related license agreement for use of certain of our
    trademarks will be reflected as licensing revenue within the
    consolidated statement of operations.

Global
    Brand Concepts and Launch of American Living

On January 8, 2007, we announced that we will begin to
    develop new lifestyle brands for specialty and department stores
    through our Global Brand Concepts (“GBC”) group. The
    GBC group will work in partnership with select department and
    specialty stores to contribute its expertise in design,
    operations, marketing, merchandising and advertising in
    developing exclusive brands for these stores. Consistent with
    this strategic initiative, on February 1, 2007, we
    announced plans to launch

American Living

, a new
    lifestyle brand created exclusively for J.C. Penney
    Company, Inc. (“JCPenney”).

American Living

products will be available in JCPenney’s stores and catalog
    beginning in the spring of calendar 2008 and will include a full
    range of merchandise for women, men and children, as well as
    intimate apparel, accessories and home products.

    youthful, energetic collection of sportswear. From edgy,
    rebellious, sport-inspired looks for men to sharp, sexy, urban
    campus styles for women, Rugby embraces a lasting sense of
    timeless individuality.

Club Monaco.

Club Monaco is a dynamic,
    international retail concept that designs, manufactures and
    markets its own Club Monaco clothing and accessories. Each
    season, Club Monaco offers men’s and women’s updated
    classics and key fashion pieces that are the foundation of a
    modern wardrobe. The brand’s signature clean and modern
    style gives classics an update through great design and a
    current sensibility. Club Monaco is the lifestyle destination
    for today’s urban professional. Currently, Club Monaco
    operates 64 stores throughout North America and, through
    licensing arrangements, has recently opened stores in Hong Kong,
    Seoul and Dubai.

American Living.

American Living will
    be the first brand launched under the new Global Brand Concepts
    group. American Living will be exclusive to JCPenney in the U.S.
    and is expected to be launched in February of


2008 in more than 650 JCPenney stores as well as the catalog and
    online. American Living will be a full lifestyle
    offering — men’s, women’s, children’s,
    accessories and home.

Chaps.

The Chaps brand does not carry
    the Ralph Lauren name, but its mission is to deliver the design
    heritage and advertising images of the Company to a broader
    consumer base in the mid-tier distribution channel and select
    independent department stores. Chaps reflects an updated
    interpretation of classic American styling from the house of
    Ralph Lauren, in full lifestyle collections in the men’s,
    women’s, children’s, accessory and home product
    categories.

Our
    Wholesale Segment

Our Wholesale segment sells our products to leading upscale and
    certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores and golf
    and pro shops, both domestically and internationally. We have
    focused on elevating our brand and improving productivity by
    reducing the number of unproductive doors within department
    stores in which our products are sold, improving in-store
    product assortment and presentation, and improving full-price
    sell-throughs to consumers. As of March 31, 2007, the end
    of Fiscal 2007, our products were sold through 8,291 domestic
    doors, and during Fiscal 2007, we invested approximately
    $32 million in shop-within-shops dedicated to our products
    in domestic department stores. We have also effected selective
    price increases on basic products and introduced new fashion
    offerings at higher price points.

Department stores are our major wholesale customers in North
    America. In Europe, our wholesale sales are a varying mix of
    sales to both department stores and specialty shops, depending
    on the country. Our collection brands — Women’s
    Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label and Men’s Purple
    Label Collection and Black Label — are distributed
    through a limited number of premier fashion retailers. In
    addition, we sell excess and

out-of-season

products through secondary distribution channels.

Worldwide
    Distribution Channels

The following table presents the approximate number of doors by

    worldwide wholesale net sales for the year ended March 31,
    2007.

•

Federated Department Stores, Inc., which represented
    approximately 29%; and

•

Dillard Department Stores, Inc., which represented approximately
    14%.

Our product brands are sold primarily through their own sales
    forces. Our Wholesale segment maintains their primary showrooms
    in New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in
    Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, London,
    Munich, Madrid and Stockholm.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical
    element of our distribution to department stores, we and our
    licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand
    recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines
    by the department stores and to differentiate the presentation
    of products. Shop-within-shops fixed assets primarily include
    items such as customized freestanding fixtures, moveable wall
    cases and components, decorative items and flooring.


As of March 31, 2007, we had approximately 10,600
    shop-within-shops dedicated to our wholesale products worldwide
    and our licensing partners had more than 600 shop-within-shops.
    During Fiscal 2007, we added approximately 1,300
    shop-within-shops. Excluding significantly larger
    shop-within-shops in key department store locations, the size of
    our shop-within-shops typically ranges from approximately 100 to
    4,800 square feet. We share in the cost of these
    shop-within-shops.

Basic Stock Replenishment
    Program.

Basic products such as knit shirts,
    chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered at any time
    through our basic stock replenishment programs. We generally
    ship these products within one to five days of order receipt.
    These products accounted for approximately 6% of our wholesale
    net sales in Fiscal 2007.

Our
    Retail Segment

Our Retail segment consists of 147 full-price retail stores and
    145 factory stores worldwide as of March 31, 2007. The
    expansion of our full-price retail store base is a primary
    long-term strategic goal. We opened 10 new full-price stores in
    Fiscal 2007 and currently anticipate opening between 10 and 15
    full-price stores in Fiscal 2008. Our retail operating profit
    rate increased from 3.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2001 to 12.9% of
    net sales in Fiscal 2007, reflecting improvements in
    productivity, gross margins, and full-margin sell-through rates.
    Our full-price retail stores reinforce the luxury image and
    distinct sensibility of our brands and feature exclusive lines
    that are not sold in domestic department stores: Blue Label for
    Women, Black Label for Men and Ralph Lauren Home. We operated
    the following full-price retail stores as of March 31, 2007:

In addition to generating sales of our products, our worldwide
    full-price stores set, reinforce and capitalize on the image of
    our brands. Our stores range in size from approximately 600 to
    over 37,500 square feet. These full-price stores are
    situated in upscale regional malls and major upscale street
    locations, generally in large urban markets. We generally lease
    our stores for initial periods ranging from 5 to 10 years
    with renewal options.

We extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our
    145 Polo Ralph Lauren factory stores worldwide. During Fiscal
    2007, we added 1 new Polo Ralph Lauren factory store, net, and
    closed our remaining


Club Monaco factory stores. Our factory stores are generally
    located in outlet malls. We operated the following factory
    retail stores as of March 31, 2007:

    product licensing partners and our suppliers.

Polo.com

In addition to our stores, our Retail segment sells Ralph Lauren
    products on-line through our

e-commerce

website, Polo.com (http://www.polo.com). Polo.com offers our
    customers access to the full breadth of Ralph Lauren apparel,
    accessories and home products, and allows us to reach retail
    customers on a multi-channel basis and reinforces the luxury
    image of our brands. In Fiscal 2007, Polo.com averaged
    2.3 million unique visitors a month and had
    1.1 million customers. Polo.com is owned and operated by RL
    Media. See

“Recent Developments”

for a
    discussion of the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity
    interest in RL Media.

Our
    Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight,
    design, and marketing skills with the specific product or
    geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and
    build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners
    who:

•

are leaders in their respective markets;

•

contribute the majority of the product development costs;

•

provide the operational infrastructure required to support the
    business; and

•

own the inventory.

We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell
    at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more
    of our trademarks. We grant our international geographic area
    licensing partners exclusive rights to distribute certain brands
    or classes of our products and operate retail stores in specific
    international territories. These geographic area licensees
    source products from us, our product licensing partners and
    independent sources. Each licensing partner pays us royalties
    based upon its sales of our products, subject, generally, to a
    minimum royalty requirement for the right to use the Polo
    trademark and design services. In addition, licensing partners
    may be required to allocate a portion of their sales revenues to
    advertise our products and share in the creative costs
    associated with these products. Larger allocations are required
    in connection with launches of new products or in new
    territories. Our licenses generally have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options. See
    Item 7 —

“Recent Developments”

for a discussion of our Eyewear Licensing Agreement.


We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that their
    products are developed, marketed and distributed so as to reach
    the intended market opportunity and to present consistently to
    consumers worldwide the distinctive perspective and lifestyle
    associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design,
    production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution,
    advertising and promotion of Polo Ralph Lauren products are
    subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight. The
    result is a consistent identity for Polo Ralph Lauren products
    across product categories and international markets.

Approximately 22% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2007 was
    derived from two product licensing partners: Impact 21, one
    of the sublicensees for Japan, and WestPoint Home, Inc,
    accounted for 14% and 8%, respectively, of our licensing revenue
    in Fiscal 2007. See

“Recent Developments”

for a
    discussion of the Tender Offer to acquire Impact 21.

International
    Licenses

We believe that international markets offer additional
    opportunities for our quintessential American designs and
    lifestyle image. We work with our international licensing
    partners to facilitate international growth in their respective
    territories. International expansion/growth opportunities may
    include:

•

the roll out of new products and brands following their launch
    in the U.S.;

•

the introduction of additional product lines;

•

the entrance into new international markets;

•

the addition of Ralph Lauren or Polo Ralph Lauren stores in
    these markets; and

•

the expansion and upgrade of

shop-in-shop

networks in these markets.

“Recent Developments”

for a
    discussion of the Tender Offer to acquire Impact 21 as well as
    the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in PRL Japan.

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to
    distribute, sell, promote, market

and/or

distribute various categories of our products in a given
    geographic area. These rights may include the right to own and
    operate retail stores. The economic arrangements are similar to
    those of our product licensing partners. We design licensed
    products either alone or in collaboration with our domestic
    licensing partners. Our product licensees whose territories do
    not include the international geographic area licensees’
    territories generally provide our international licensing
    partners with product or patterns, piece goods, manufacturing
    locations and other information and assistance necessary to
    achieve product uniformity, for which they are often compensated.

As of March 31, 2007, our international licensing partners
    operated 4 Ralph Lauren stores, 35 Polo Ralph Lauren
    stores, 27 Polo Jeans stores, 3 Children’s stores and 11
    Polo factory stores.

Ralph
    Lauren Home

Together with our licensing partners, we offer an extensive
    collection of home products that draw upon and further the
    design themes of our other product lines, contributing to our
    complete lifestyle concept. Products are sold under the Ralph
    Lauren Home, Lauren Ralph Lauren and Chaps brands in three
    primary categories: bedding and bath, home décor and home
    improvement. As of March 31, 2007, we had agreements with 9
    domestic and 2 international home product licensing
    partners and one international home product sublicensing partner.

We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home
    licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners.
    These services include design, operating showrooms, marketing,
    advertising and, in some cases, sales. In general, the licensing
    partners manufacture, own the inventory and ship the products.
    Our Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances generally have 3 to

5-year

terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.


Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the upper tiers of
    their respective markets and are offered at a range of price
    levels. These products are generally distributed through several
    channels of distribution, including department stores, specialty
    home furnishings stores, interior design showrooms, customer
    direct mail catalogs, home centers and the Internet, as well as
    our own stores. As with our other products, the use of
    shop-within-shops is central to our department store
    distribution strategy.

    47% of total Ralph Lauren Home licensing revenue in Fiscal 2007.

Product
    Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative American style
    associated with and defined by Ralph Lauren and our design team.
    Our consistent emphasis on innovative and distinctive design has
    been an important contributor to the prominence, strength and
    reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the
    direction of, Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which is
    divided into nine departments: Menswear, Women’s
    Collection, Women’s ready to wear, Dresses,
    Children’s, Accessories, Home, Club Monaco and Rugby. We
    form design teams around our brands and product categories to
    develop concepts, themes and products for each brand and
    category. These teams support all three segments of our
    business — Wholesale, Retail and Licensing —
    through close collaboration with merchandising, sales and
    production staff and licensing partners in order to gain market
    and other input.

Marketing

Our marketing program communicates the themes and images of our
    brands and is an integral feature of our product offering.
    Worldwide marketing is managed on a centralized basis through
    our advertising and public relations departments in order to
    ensure consistency of presentation.

We create distinctive image advertising for all of our products,
    conveying the particular message of each brand within the
    context of our core themes. Advertisements generally portray a
    lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of
    products offered by ourselves and, in some cases, our licensing
    partners. Our primary advertising medium is print, with multiple
    page advertisements appearing regularly in a range of fashion,
    lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major print
    advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and spring
    retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to coincide
    with product deliveries. In addition to print, some product


categories have utilized television and outdoor media in their
    marketing programs for certain product categories. Our Polo.com

e-commerce

website presents the Ralph Lauren lifestyle on the Internet
    while offering the full breadth of our apparel, accessories and
    home products.

If our domestic licensing partners are required to spend an
    amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on
    advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their
    behalf.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each
    of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at
    major fashion shows in New York City, which typically generate
    extensive domestic and international media coverage. We
    introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at
    major fashion shows in cities such as New York or Milan, Italy.
    In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our models,
    professional golfers and sponsors. We are the first exclusive
    outfitter for all on-court officials at Wimbledon through 2010.
    We are also the official outfitter of all on-court officials at
    the U.S. Open tennis tournament through 2009.

Sourcing,
    Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own
    or operate any production facilities. Over 350 different
    manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear and
    accessories products. We source both finished products and raw
    materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons and other trim.
    Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled
    products ready for shipment to our customers. In Fiscal 2007,
    less than 1%, by dollar volume, of our products were produced in
    the U.S., and over 99%, by dollar volume, were produced outside
    the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. See

“Import Restrictions and other Government
    Regulations”

and Part 1A —

“Our
    business is subject to government regulations and other risks
    associated with importing products.”

Two manufacturers engaged by us accounted for approximately 12%
    and 8% of our total production during Fiscal 2007, respectively.
    The primary production facilities of these two manufacturers are
    located in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Philippines,
    Saipan and Sri Lanka.

Our Wholesale segment must commit to manufacture the majority of
    our garments before we receive customer orders. We also must
    commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance of our
    sales. If we overestimate our primary customers’ demand for
    a particular product, we may sell the excess in our factory
    stores or sell the product through secondary distribution
    channels. If we overestimate the need for a particular fabric or
    yarn, that fabric or yarn may be used in garments made for
    subsequent seasons or made into past seasons’ styles for
    distribution in our factory stores.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global
    manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia,
    the Americas and Europe. All garments are produced according to
    our specifications. Production and quality control staff in the
    Americas, Asia and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier
    facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the
    final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor
    certification and compliance programs, so that quality assurance
    is focused upon as early as possible in the production process,
    allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution
    facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.

Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and
    consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with
    numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic and foreign.
    Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
    substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on
    the basis of fashion, quality and service, which depend on our
    ability to:

•

anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely
    manner;

•

maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

develop and produce high quality products that appeal to
    consumers;


•

appropriately price our products;

•

provide strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensure product availability; and

•

obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present our
    products at retail.

See Item 1A —

“We face intense
    competition in the worldwide apparel industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution domestically, Ralph Lauren men’s
    and women’s products are shipped from manufacturers
    primarily to our distribution center in Greensboro, North
    Carolina for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment to retail
    customers. Ralph Lauren Childrenswear products are shipped from
    our manufacturers to a leased distribution center in
    Martinsburg, West Virginia. In addition, we utilize third party
    logistics providers to manage selected programs for specific
    customers. These facilities are designed to allow for high
    density cube storage and utilize bar code technology to provide
    inventory management and carton controls. Product traffic
    management is also coordinated from these facilities. European
    distribution and warehousing has been largely consolidated into
    one third party facility located in Parma, Italy.

Our full-price store and factory store distribution and
    warehousing are principally handled through the Greensboro
    distribution center. Club Monaco products are distributed from
    facilities in Ontario, Canada, New Jersey and California.

Value Vision currently performs warehousing, order fulfillment
    and call center functions for RL Media, which operates our
    Polo.com

e-commerce

website. Contemporaneous with our acquisition of the remaining
    50% equity interest in RL Media, we entered into a transition
    services agreement with Value Vision to continue to support RL
    Media over a period of up to seventeen months from the date of
    the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest. RL Media
    anticipates performing warehouse, order fulfillment and call
    center functions on its own in Fiscal 2008. We expect to occupy
    a 360,000 square foot leased distribution facility in High
    Point, North Carolina, for our RL Media business during Fiscal
    2008. The term of the lease will be 15 years commencing on
    the date of the substantial completion of the facility.

Management
    Information Systems

Our management information systems make the marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution of our products more
    efficient by providing, among other things:

•

comprehensive order processing;

•

production information;

•

accounting information; and

•

an enterprise view of information for our marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution functions.

The

point-of-sale

registers in our stores enable us to track inventory from store
    receipt to final sale on a real-time basis. We believe our
    merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our

point-of-sale

registers and software programs, allow for rapid stock
    replenishment, concise merchandise planning and real-time
    inventory accounting. See Item 1A —

“Certain legal proceedings could adversely impact our
    results of operations.”

We also utilize a sophisticated automated replenishment system
    to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from
    our wholesale customers, the movement of goods through
    distribution channels, and the collection of information for
    planning and forecasting. We have a collaborative relationship
    with many of our suppliers that enables us to reduce cash to
    cash cycles in the management of our inventory. In Fiscal 2006,
    we began implementing a new, global enterprise resource
    management system for our Wholesale segment. We anticipate
    completing the implementation of this system across all of our
    wholesale divisions by the end of Fiscal 2010. See
    Item 1A —

“Our business could suffer if
    our computer systems are disrupted or cease to operate
    effectively.”


Wholesale
    Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise
    primarily to major department stores and extend credit based on
    an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels
    and the financial condition of our customers on a continuing
    basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor our accounts
    receivables or maintain credit insurance to manage the risks of
    bad debts. Our bad debt write-offs were $1.2 million in
    Fiscal 2007, representing less than 1 percent of net
    revenues. See Item 1A —

“Our business
    could be negatively impacted by any financial instability of our
    customers.”

Wholesale
    Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products
    approximately three to five months prior to the time the
    products are delivered to stores. Such orders are generally
    subject to broad cancellation rights. As of March 31, 2007,
    our summer and fall backlog was $324 million and
    $803 million, respectively, compared to $291 million
    and $746 million, respectively, as of April 1, 2006.
    Our backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the
    timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which
    a significant percentage of our orders are received, and the
    timing of shipments. As a consequence, a comparison of backlog
    from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not
    be indicative of eventual shipments.

Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph Lauren” and the
    famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the
    U.S. Other trademarks we own include:

•

“Lauren/Ralph Lauren”;

•

“RRL”;

•

“Club Monaco”;

•

“Rugby”;

•

“RLX”;

•

“Chaps”;

•

“American Living”; and

•

Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.

Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks

“

Ralph Lauren,” “Double RL” and
    “RRL” in perpetuity in connection with, among other
    things, beef and living animals. The trademarks “Double
    RL” and “RRL” are currently used by the Double RL
    Company, an entity wholly-owned by Mr. Lauren. In addition,
    Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects
    involving film or theatrical productions (not including or
    relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a
    company wholly owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these
    companies has no impact on us.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations and pending
    applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items
    of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings and
    beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services,
    and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration
    of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and
    enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the
    related products and services and the required registration
    renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks
    and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as
    extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a
    worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against
    infringement (see Item 3 —

“Legal
    Proceedings”

for further discussion). As a result of
    the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object
    of counterfeiting. We have a broad enforcement program which has
    been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit
    products in the U.S. and in major markets abroad.


In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our
    trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our
    international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with
    various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in
    certain trademarks, including “Polo”

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, which would
    impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks.
    While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to
    time as we continue our international expansion, we have
    generally successfully resolved such conflicts in the past
    through both legal action and negotiated settlements with
    third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see
    Item 1A —

“Our trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected
    outside the U.S.”

and Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion).
    Although we have not in the past suffered any material
    restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable
    markets, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not
    arise in the future as we expand product offerings and
    additional trademarks to new markets.

We currently have an agreement with a third party which owned
    conflicting registrations of the trademarks “Polo” and
    a polo player astride a horse in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong
    and South Africa. Under the agreement, the third party retains
    the right to use the “Polo” and polo player symbol
    marks in South Africa and all other countries that comprise

Sub-Saharan

Africa, and we agreed to restrict use of those Polo marks in
    those countries to fragrances and cosmetics solely as part of
    the composite trademark “Ralph Lauren” and the polo
    player symbol, as to which our use is unlimited, and to the use
    of the polo player symbol mark on women’s and girls’
    apparel and accessories and women’s and girls’
    handkerchiefs. By agreeing to those restrictions, we secured the
    unlimited right to use our trademarks in the United Kingdom and
    Hong Kong without payment of any kind, and the third party is
    prohibited from distributing products under those trademarks in
    those countries.

Import
    Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the U.S., Canada,
    and Europe is subject to duties. Until January 1, 2005, our
    apparel merchandise was also subject to quotas. Quotas represent
    the right, pursuant to bilateral or other international trade
    arrangements, to export amounts of certain categories of
    merchandise into a country or territory pursuant to a visa or
    license. Pursuant to the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,
    quotas on textile and apparel products were eliminated for World
    Trade Organization (“WTO”) member countries, including
    the U.S., Canada and European countries, on January 1,
    2005. Notwithstanding quota elimination, China’s accession
    agreement for membership in the WTO provides that WTO member
    countries (including the U.S., Canada and European countries)
    may reimpose quotas on specific categories of products in the
    event it is determined that imports from China have surged and
    are threatening to create a market disruption for such
    categories of products (so called “safeguard quota
    provisions”). In response to surging imports, in November
    2005 the U.S. and China agreed to a new quota arrangement which
    will impose quotas on certain textile products through the end
    of calendar 2008. In addition, the European Union also agreed
    with China on a new textile arrangement which imposed quotas
    through the end of calendar 2007. The U.S. and other countries
    may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a
    particular product being imported (from China or other
    countries) at unfairly traded prices that in such increased
    quantities as to cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant
    domestic industry (generally known as “anti-dumping”
    actions). The European Union has imposed anti-dumping duties on
    imports from China and Vietnam in certain footwear categories.
    On January 11, 2007, the Bush Administration imposed a
    Vietnam Import Monitoring Program on five broad product
    groups — shirts, trousers, sweaters, underwear, and
    swimwear — to determine whether any of those imports
    might be unfairly traded, due to dumping. The review period will
    last for the remainder of the Bush Administration with six-month
    reviews of data collected. If dumping is suspected, the
    U.S. Government will self-initiate a dumping case on behalf
    of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly
    affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally
    known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the
    U.S. Government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign
    government to foreign manufactures if the importation of such
    subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a
    U.S. industry. Recent developments have now made it
    possible to impose countervailing duties on products from
    non-market economies, such as China, which would significantly
    affect our costs.

We are also subject to other international trade agreements and
    regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,
    the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean
    Basin Initiative. In addition, each of the countries in which
    our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports.
    Because the U.S. and the


other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold
    may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges
    or other import controls or restrictions, including the
    imposition of “safeguard quota,” or adjust presently
    prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program
    of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and
    opportunities. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to
    import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments
    in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among
    countries and manufacturers, as well as through geographical
    diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all our products are manufactured by foreign
    suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the
    administration of current international trade regulations,
    executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in
    sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quota could
    adversely affect our operations. Although we generally expect
    that the 2005 elimination of quotas will result, over the long
    term, in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced
    abroad, the implementation of any “safeguard quota
    provisions” or any “anti-dumping” or
    “countervailing duty” actions may result, over the
    near term, in cost increases for certain categories of products
    and in disruption of the supply chain for certain products
    categories. See Item 1A —

“Risk
    Factors”

below for further discussion.

Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to
    regulation in the U.S. and other countries by other governmental
    agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission,
    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer Products
    Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to
    product labeling, licensing requirements and flammability
    testing. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with
    those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local,
    and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of
    materials hazardous to the environment. We do not estimate any
    significant capital expenditures for environmental control
    matters either in the current year or in the near future. Our
    licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to
    regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to
    operate in compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are
    not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected
    to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
    operations.

Although we have not suffered any material inhibition from doing
    business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that
    significant impediments will not arise in the future as we
    expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to
    new markets.

Employees

As of March 31, 2007, we had approximately 14,000
    employees, consisting of approximately 11,000 in the U.S. and
    approximately 3,000 in foreign countries. 38 of our
    U.S. production and distribution employees in the
    womenswear business are members of the Union of Needletrades,
    Industrial & Textile Employees under an industry
    association collective bargaining agreement, which our
    womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations
    with both our union and non-union employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking
    statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
    business, our operating results, our financial condition and the
    actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements
    are made in this report.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The loss
    of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or other key personnel
    could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing
    and operational areas of our business has been a critical
    element of our success since the inception of our Company. The
    death or disability of Mr. Lauren or other extended or
    permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or
    industry perception with respect to him or arising from his
    loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our
    other executive officers and other members of senior management
    have substantial experience and expertise in our business and
    have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
    The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these
    individuals could also adversely affect us. We are not protected
    by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance
    covering Mr. Lauren, our other executive officers and
    certain other members of senior management. We have entered into
    employment agreements with Mr. Lauren and our other
    executive officers. We have entered into employment agreements
    with Mr. Lauren and our other executive officers, but the
    noncompete period with respect to Mr. Lauren and certain
    other executive officers could, in some circumstances in the
    event of their termination of employment with the Company, end
    prior to the employment term set forth in their employment
    agreements.

We cannot
    assure the successful implementation of our growth
    strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands,
    expand our geographic coverage and increase direct management of
    our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically
    acquiring or integrating select licenses previously held by our
    licensees and enhancing our operations. Implementation of our
    strategy involves the continued expansion of our business in
    Europe, Asia and other international areas. As discussed in
    Item 1 —

“Recent Developments,”

on May 29, 2007, we acquired a controlling interest in
    Impact 21, as part of the Tender Offer, and the remaining
    50% interest in PRL Japan. We also acquired in April 2007 our
    previously licensed belts and leather goods business and the
    remaining 50% interest in RL Media on March 28, 2007. In
    Fiscal 2006 we acquired our previously licensed men’s and
    women’s casual apparel and sportswear in the U.S. and
    Canada from Jones Apparel Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    (“Polo Jeans Business”). In addition, in Fiscal 2006,
    we acquired our previously licensed men’s, women’s and
    children’s footwear from Reebok International Ltd.
    (“Footwear Business”).

We may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our
    operations, hiring and retaining qualified key employees, or
    otherwise successfully managing such expansion. Furthermore, we
    may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any
    licensee that we acquire into our own business or achieve any
    expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.

Implementation of our strategy involves the continuation, and
    expansion of our distribution network, both in the U.S. and
    abroad. We may not be able to procure, purchase or lease
    desirable free-standing, or department store locations, or renew
    and maintain existing free-standing store leases and department
    store locations on acceptable terms.

In Europe we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we
    have in the U.S., and we may have difficulty developing
    successful distribution strategies and alliances in each of the
    major European countries. In Japan, our primary mode of
    distribution is via a network of shops located within the
    leading department stores. We may have difficulty in
    successfully retaining this network, and expanding into
    alternate distribution channels. Additionally, macroeconomic
    trends may not be favorable, and could limit our ability to
    implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we
    have foreign operations, such as Europe and Asia.


Our
    business could suffer as a result of consolidations,
    restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail
    industry.

Several of our department store customers, including some under
    common ownership, account for significant portions of our
    wholesale net sales. We believe that a substantial portion of
    sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing
    partners, including sales made by our sales force of Ralph
    Lauren Home products, are also made to our largest department
    store customers. In Fiscal 2007, sales to Federated Department
    Stores, Inc. represented 29% of our wholesale net sales and
    sales to Dillard Department Stores, Inc. represented 14% of our
    wholesale net sales. In the aggregate, our ten largest customers
    accounted for approximately 67% of our wholesale net sales
    during Fiscal 2007. There can be no assurance that
    consolidations in the department store sector will not have a
    material adverse effect on our wholesale business.

We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our
    customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
    commitments with our customers for each of our lines every
    season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores
    or any other significant customer, whether motivated by
    competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
    decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from
    us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing
    business with us or our licensing partners could have a material
    adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Our
    business could be negatively impacted by any financial
    instability of our customers.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department
    stores across the U.S. and Europe and extend credit based on an
    evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, usually
    without requiring collateral. However, the financial
    difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or
    eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more
    credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables. Two of
    our customers, Dillard Department Stores, Inc. and Federated
    Department Stores, Inc. in the aggregate constituted 37% of
    trade accounts receivable outstanding as of March 31, 2007.
    Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from
    any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect
    on our business or financial condition. See
    Item 1 —

“Credit Control.”

Certain
    legal proceedings and regulatory matters could adversely impact
    our results of operations.

We are involved in certain legal proceedings and are subject to
    various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims,
    credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail
    store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters
    and other litigations. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if
    decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in
    material liability to the Company or have a negative impact on
    the Company’s reputation or relations with its employees,
    customers, licensees or other third parties. Further, changes in
    governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries
    where we conduct business operations could have an adverse
    impact on our results of operations. See Item 3 —

“Legal Proceedings”

for further discussion of
    the Company’s legal matters.

Our
    business could suffer if our computer systems are disrupted or
    cease to operate effectively.

The Company relies heavily on its computer systems to record and
    process transactions and manage and operate our business. We
    also utilize a sophisticated automated replenishment system to
    facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our
    wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution
    channels, and the collection of information for planning and
    forecasting. Given the complexity of our business and the
    significant number of transactions that we engage in on an
    annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain constant
    operation of our computer hardware and software systems. Despite
    our efforts to prevent, our systems are vulnerable from time to
    time to damage or interruption from, among other things,
    security breaches, computer viruses or power outages. In
    addition, we are currently undergoing a system conversion that
    is intended to establish a common platform across our various
    wholesale businesses, which is expected to be completed by the
    end of Fiscal 2010 across all of our wholesale divisions.
    The risk of disruption is increased when complex systems changes
    of this type are undertaken. If our systems are damaged or fail
    to function effectively, the Company will likely have to make a
    significant monetary investment to fix or replace them and the
    Company could endure interruptions or


delays in its operations. Any material interruption in our
    computer operations could have a material adverse effect on our
    business or results of operations.

Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.

As of March 31, 2007, we source a significant portion of
    our products outside the U.S. through arrangements with
    over 350 foreign vendors in various countries. In Fiscal 2007,
    over 99%, by dollar value, of our products were produced outside
    the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. Risks
    inherent in importing our products include:

•

quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements with China and
    non-WTO countries. These agreements limit the amount and type of
    goods that may be imported annually from these countries;

•

changes in social, political and economic conditions or
    terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from
    the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are
    located;

•

the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or
    exports;

•

the imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports or exports;

•

significant fluctuations of the cost of raw materials;

•

significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security
    considerations;

•

the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings
    resulting in the potential assessment of special antidumping or
    countervailing duties; and

•

the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties
    either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy
    perceived illegal actions by national governments.

Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
    ability to conduct business in international markets may be
    affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
    risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets
    and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing
    international markets is subject to risks associated with
    international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.

We are also subject to general political and economic risks in
    connection with our international operations, including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other
    similar restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European
    Union, Japan, or other countries upon the import or export of
    our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions
    would have on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social or
    economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse
    effect on our business in the future or may require us to
    significantly modify our current business practices.


Our
    trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
    adequately protected outside the U.S.

We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are
    extremely important to our success and our competitive position.
    We devote substantial resources to the establishment and
    protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities
    worldwide. Significant counterfeiting of our products continues,
    however, and in the course of our international expansion we
    have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have
    acquired or claimed ownership rights in some trademarks that
    include Polo

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise
    have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past
    resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action
    and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken
    to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary
    rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material
    adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation
    of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and
    proprietary rights of others. Also, there can be no assurance
    that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of,
    trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will
    be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
    satisfaction or at all. In addition, the laws of certain foreign

.”

Our
    business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer’s
    inability to produce our goods on time and to our
    specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend
    exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of
    all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our
    specifications primarily by international manufacturers. During
    Fiscal 2007, less than 1%, by dollar value, of our men’s
    and women’s products were manufactured in the U.S. and over
    99%, by dollar value, of these products were manufactured in
    other countries. Two of the manufacturers engaged by us
    accounted for approximately 12% and 8% of our total production
    during Fiscal 2007. The primary production facilities of these
    two manufacturers are located in Asia. The inability of a
    manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner
    or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the
    delivery date requirements of our customers for those items,
    which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept
    deliveries or a substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of
    which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use
    acceptable labor practices.

We require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers
    to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote
    ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and
    monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do
    not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The
    violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer
    used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence
    of an independent manufacturer’s or licensing
    partner’s labor practices from those generally accepted as
    ethical in the U.S., could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the
    shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation.
    Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if we need to replace
    manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the production capacity of
    our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these
    competitors have greater financial and other resources than we
    have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for
    production and import quota capacity. If we experience a
    significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
    of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party
    manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional
    capacity will be available when required on terms that are
    acceptable to us. See Item 1 —

“Sourcing,
    Production and Quality.”

We enter into a number of
    purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for
    delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications
    and other standard industry provisions, but do not have
    long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the
    manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.


Our
    business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency
    fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars.
    However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result,
    the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the
    value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
    rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
    currency denominated prices at which our international
    businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales
    and licensing revenue generally is derived from sales in foreign
    currencies. These foreign currencies include the Japanese Yen,
    the Euro and the Pound Sterling, and this revenue could be
    materially affected by currency fluctuations. Although we hedge
    some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure you
    that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material
    adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. See Item 7 —

“Market Risk
    Management.”

We rely
    on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our
    licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our
    licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks
    specific to a licensing partner’s business, including, for
    example, risks associated with a particular licensing
    partner’s ability to:

•

obtain capital;

•

manage its labor relations;

•

maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

manage its credit risk effectively; and

•

maintain relationships with its customers.

Although some of our license agreements prohibit licensing
    partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our
    competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded
    from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered
    by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of
    sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are
    also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
    control over our licensing partners’ products and
    advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other
    things, operational and financial control over their businesses.
    Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor
    execution or financial difficulties with respect to any of our
    licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Our Licensing Segment.”

Failure
    to maintain licensing partners could harm our
    business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we could replace
    existing licensing partners if necessary, our inability to do so
    for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    Item 1 —

“Our Licensing Segment.”

Risks
    Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete

We face
    intense competition in the worldwide apparel industry.

We face a variety of intense competitive challenges from other
    domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual apparel
    producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more
    diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources
    than we have. We compete with these companies primarily on the
    basis of:

•

anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors
    and styles that appeal to consumers;

•

appropriately pricing products;


•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain
    efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective
    presentation of our products at retail stores.

We also face increasing competition from companies selling
    apparel and home products through the Internet. Although RL
    Media sells our products domestically through the Internet,
    increased competition in the worldwide apparel, accessories and
    home product industries from Internet-based competitors could
    reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our
    results of operations.

The
    success of our business depends on our ability to respond to
    constantly changing fashion trends and consumer
    demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate
    and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as
    to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of
    consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty
    and are subject to rapid change. We cannot assure you that we
    will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
    successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the
    future. In addition, we cannot assure you that any new products
    or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by
    consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and
    respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion
    trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of
    our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold
    inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be
    forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of
    excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business. At
    the same time, our focus on tight management of inventory may
    result, from time to time, in our not having an adequate supply
    of products to meet consumer demand and cause us to lose sales.
    See Item 1 —

“Sourcing, Production and
    Quality.”

A
    downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of
    discretionary items and luxury retail products, which could
    adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic
    factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer
    spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance and home products
    industries, including, among others:

•

general business conditions;

•

economic downturns;

•

employment levels;

•

downturns in the stock market;

•

interest rates;

•

the housing market;

•

consumer debt levels;

•

the availability of consumer credit;

•

increases in fuel prices;

•

taxation; and

•

consumer confidence in future economic conditions.

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail
    products, including our products, may decline during
    recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income
    is lower. A downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in
    which we, or our licensing partners, sell our products may
    materially adversely affect our businesses and our revenues and
    profits.


The domestic and international political situation also affects
    consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of
    terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to
    a decrease in consumer spending.

Item 2.

Properties

We lease space for our retail and factory showrooms, and
    warehouse and office space in various domestic and international
    locations. We do not own any real property except for our
    distribution facility in Greensboro, North Carolina and a
    parcel of land adjacent to the facility, and retail stores in
    Southampton, New York and Nantucket, Massachusetts.
    Contemporaneous with our acquisition of the remaining 50% equity
    interest in RL Media, we entered into a transition services
    agreement with Value Vision to continue to provide all
    warehousing, order fulfillment and call center functions for RL
    Media through August 2008. RL Media anticipates performing
    warehousing, order fulfillment and call center functions on its
    own in Fiscal 2008.

We believe that our existing facilities are well maintained, in
    good operating condition and are adequate for our present level
    of operations. The following table sets forth information with
    respect to our key properties:

We expect to occupy a 360,000 square foot leased
    distribution facility in High Point, North Carolina, for our RL
    Media business during Fiscal 2008. The term of the lease will be
    15 years commencing on the date of the substantial
    completion of the facility.

We paid aggregate rent in Fiscal 2007 of approximately
    $54 million for our non-retail facilities. We anticipate
    that we will be able to extend those leases which expire in the
    near future on terms satisfactory to us or relocate to
    facilities timely and on acceptable terms.

As of March 31, 2007, we operated 292 retail stores,
    totaling approximately 2.3 million square feet. Aggregate
    annual rentals for retail space in Fiscal 2007 totaled
    approximately $118 million. We anticipate that we will be
    able to extend those leases which expire in the near future on
    satisfactory terms or relocate to desirable locations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is indirectly subject to various claims relating to
    allegations of security breaches in certain of its retail store
    information systems. These claims have been made by various
    credit card associations, issuing banks and credit card
    processors with respect to cards issued by them pursuant to the
    rules imposed by certain credit card


issuers, particularly
    Visa

®

and
    MasterCard

®

.
    The allegations include fraudulent credit card charges, the cost
    of replacing credit cards, related monitoring expenses and other
    related claims.

In Fiscal 2005, the Company was subject to various claims
    relating to an alleged security breach of its

point-of-sale

systems that occurred at certain Polo retail stores in the
    U.S. The Company has previously recorded a reserve in an
    aggregate amount of $13 million to provide for its best
    estimate of losses related to these claims. $6.2 million
    was recorded during Fiscal 2005 and the remaining
    $6.8 million of this reserve was recorded during Fiscal
    2006. The Company has paid $11.4 million through
    March 31, 2007 in settlement of these various claims. The
    eligibility period for filing any new claims with respect to
    this matter expired at the end of January 2007.

In addition, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company
    was notified of an alleged compromise of its retail store
    information systems that process its credit card data for
    certain Club Monaco stores in Canada. While the investigation of
    the alleged Club Monaco compromise is ongoing, the evidence to
    date indicates that only numerical credit card data may have
    been accessed and not customer names or contact information. The
    Company’s Canadian credit card processor has thus far
    required the Company to create a reserve of $2 million to
    cover potential claims relating to this alleged compromise and
    has deducted funds from Club Monaco credit card transactions to
    establish this reserve. Since the Company has been advised by
    its credit card processor that potential claims related to this
    matter are likely to exceed $2 million in the aggregate,
    the Company has also recorded an additional $3 million
    charge during Fiscal 2007 to increase the total reserve for this
    matter to $5 million based on its best estimate of
    exposure. Although claims brought against the Company could
    exceed the amount of the $5 million reserve, in any event
    the ultimate resolution of these claims is not expected to have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or
    financial position.

The Company is cooperating with law enforcement authorities in
    both the U.S. and Canada in their investigations of these
    matters.

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd., our domestic
    licensee for luggage and handbags (“Wathne”), filed a
    complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren, our Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other things,
    federal trademark law violations, breach of contract, breach of
    obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
    misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other relief,
    injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the Court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. A trial date is not yet set for this
    lawsuit on the breach of contract claims but the Company does
    not currently anticipate that a trial will occur prior to
    calendar 2008. We believe this lawsuit to be without merit, we
    have recently moved for summary judgment and we intend to
    continue to contest this lawsuit vigorously. Accordingly,
    management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this
    matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    liquidity or financial position.

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit against the
    U.S. Polo Association Inc. (“USPA”), Jordache,
    Ltd. (“Jordache”) and certain other entities
    affiliated with them, alleging that the defendants were
    infringing on our trademarks. In connection with this lawsuit,
    on July 19, 2001, the USPA and Jordache filed a lawsuit
    against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York. This suit, which was effectively a
    counterclaim by them in connection with the original trademark
    action, asserted claims related to our actions in our pursuit of
    claims against the U.S. Polo Association and Jordache for
    trademark infringement and other unlawful conduct. Their claims
    stemmed from our contacts with the USPA’s and
    Jordache’s retailers in which we informed these retailers
    of our position in the original trademark action. All claims and
    counterclaims, except for our claims that the defendants
    violated our trademark rights, were settled in September 2003.
    We did not pay any damages in this settlement.

On July 30, 2004, the Court denied all motions for summary
    judgment, and trial began on October 3, 2005 with respect
    to four “double horseman” symbols that the defendants
    sought to use. On October 20, 2005, the jury rendered a
    verdict, finding that one of the defendants’ marks violated
    our world famous Polo Player Symbol trademark and enjoining its
    further use, but allowing the defendants to use the remaining
    three marks. On


November 16, 2005, we filed a motion before the trial court
    to overturn the jury’s decision and hold a new trial with
    respect to the three marks that the jury found not to be
    infringing. The USPA and Jordache opposed our motion, but did
    not move to overturn the jury’s decision that the fourth
    double horseman logo did infringe on our trademarks. On
    July 7, 2006, the judge denied our motion to overturn the
    jury’s decision. On August 4, 2006, we filed an appeal
    of the judge’s decision to deny our motion for a new trial
    to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We are
    awaiting a decision from the Court with respect to this appeal.

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of our stores
    filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for
    the District of Northern California alleging violations of
    California antitrust and labor laws. The plaintiff purported to
    represent a class of employees who had allegedly been injured by
    a requirement that certain retail employees purchase and wear
    our apparel as a condition of their employment. The complaint,
    as amended, seeks an unspecified amount of actual and punitive
    damages, disgorgement of profits and injunctive and declaratory
    relief. We answered the amended complaint on November 4,
    2002. A hearing on cross motions for summary judgment on the
    issue of whether our policies violated California law occurred
    on August 14, 2003. The Court granted partial summary
    judgment with respect to certain of the plaintiff’s claims,
    but concluded that more discovery was necessary before it could
    decide the key issue as to whether we had maintained for a
    period of time a dress code policy that violated California law.
    On January 12, 2006, a proposed settlement of the purported
    class action was submitted to the court for approval. A hearing
    on the settlement was held before the Court on June 29,
    2006. On October 26, 2006, the Court granted preliminary
    approval of the settlement and agreed to begin the process of
    sending out claim forms to members of the class. On
    March 28, 2007, the Court granted final approval of the
    settlement and awarded approximately $1.1 million to
    members of the class and their attorneys. We had previously
    established a reserve of $1.5 million for this matter in
    Fiscal 2005. The Court’s approval of the settlement also
    resulted in the dismissal of the similar purported class action
    filed in San Francisco Superior Court, as described below.

On April 14, 2003, a second putative class action was filed
    in the San Francisco Superior Court. This suit, brought by
    the same attorneys, alleged near identical claims to those in
    the federal class action. The class representatives consisted of
    former employees and the plaintiff in the federal class action.
    Defendants in this class action included us and our Polo Retail,
    LLC, Fashions Outlet of America, Inc., Polo Retail, Inc. and
    San Francisco Polo, Ltd. subsidiaries as well as a
    non-affiliated corporate defendant and two current managers. As
    in the federal class action, the complaint sought an unspecified
    amount of actual and punitive restitution of monies spent, and
    declaratory relief. As noted above, on March 28, 2007, the
    Court granted final approval of the settlement in the federal
    class action, which resulted in the dismissal of this lawsuit.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims and
    proceedings involving credit card fraud, trademark and
    intellectual property, licensing, employee relations and other
    matters incidental to our business. We believe that the
    resolution of these other matters currently pending will not
    individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition or results of operations.

On May 20, 2003, our Board of Directors initiated a regular
    quarterly cash dividend program of $0.05 per share, or
    $0.20 per share on an annual basis, on our Class A
    common stock. Approximately $21 million was recorded as a
    reduction to retained earnings during Fiscal 2007 in connection
    with these dividends.

As of May 18, 2007, there were 1,508 holders of record of
    our Class A common stock and 11 holders of record of our
    Class B common stock. All of our outstanding shares of
    Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren and
    related entities and are convertible at any time into shares of
    Class A common stock on a

one-for-one

These purchases were made on the
    open market under the Company’s Class A common stock
    repurchase program. In November 2006, the Company’s Board
    of Directors approved an expansion of the Company’s
    existing common stock repurchase program that allows the Company
    to repurchase, at its discretion from time to time, up to
    $500 million of Class A common stock. Repurchases of
    shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall
    business and market conditions. This program does not have a
    fixed termination date.


The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder
    return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) on our
    Class A common stock with the cumulative total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, our peer group
    for the preceding fiscal year — the
    Standard & Poor’s Composite 1500 Apparel,
    Accessories & Luxury Goods Index (“Old Peer
    Group”) and a peer group index of companies that we believe
    are similar to ours (“New Peer Group”) for the period
    from March 28, 2002, the last trading day in the
    Company’s 2002 fiscal year, through March 31, 2007,
    the last trading day in the Company’s 2007 fiscal year. Our
    New Peer Group consists of Coach, Estee Lauder, Jones Apparel,
    Kellwood, Kenneth Cole, Liz Claiborne, Phillips Van Heusen,
    Tiffany & Co., VF Corp., Warnaco, LVMH, Burberry,
    Christian Dior, PPR SA, Hermes International, Richemont,
    Luxottica and Tod’s Group. We believe that the companies in
    our New Peer Group index, taken together, are more comparable to
    our businesses. The returns are calculated by assuming an
    investment in the Class A common stock and each index of
    $100 on March 29, 2002, with all dividends reinvested.

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and
    distribution of premium lifestyle products including men’s,
    women’s and children’s apparel, accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishings. Our long-standing reputation
    and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    Our brand names include

Polo

,

Polo by Ralph Lauren,
    Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Black Label, RLX, Ralph
    Lauren Blue Label, Lauren, RRL, Rugby, Chaps, Club Monaco

and

American Living

, among others.

We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale,
    Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing 54%
    of Fiscal 2007 net revenues) consists of wholesale-channel
    sales made principally to major department stores, specialty
    stores and golf and pro shops located throughout the U.S. and
    Europe. Our retail business (representing 41% of Fiscal
    2007 net revenues) consists of retail-channel sales
    directly to consumers through full-price and factory retail
    stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South
    America and Asia, and through our retail internet site located
    at www.Polo.com. In addition, our licensing business
    (representing 5% of


Fiscal 2007 net revenues) consists of royalty-based
    arrangements under which we license the right to third parties
    to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture
    and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and
    fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified
    periods. Approximately 20% of our Fiscal 2007 net revenues was
    earned in the international regions outside of the U.S. and
    Canada. See Note 20 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues
    by geographic location.

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels
    of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher
    retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends
    result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments
    and key vacation travel,

back-to-school

and holiday periods in the Retail segment.

Our
    Objectives and Risks

We believe our core strengths, including a global luxury
    lifestyle brand, a strong and experienced management team, a
    proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed
    through multiple retail channels in global markets, a
    disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet,
    have collectively enabled us to significantly increase
    stockholder value in recent years. Further, we believe those
    core strengths will continue to allow us to execute our strategy
    for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and
    operating cash flow.

Our operating success has been driven by the Company’s
    focus on six key objectives:

•

Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core
    and heritage-driven brand;

•

Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution
    channels and geographic regions;

•

Improving brand control and positioning;

•

Focusing on selective strategic partnerships;

•

Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a
    worldwide business; and

•

Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow.

In connection with these objectives, we intend to continue to
    pursue opportunities for growth globally to expand our retail
    presence in various formats designed to meet consumer needs, to
    further develop a wide array of luxury accessories product
    offerings, and to create new lifestyle brands in partnership
    with select department and specialty stores.

Significant challenges and risks accompany our opportunities for
    long-term growth and our ability to increase stockholder value.

    further discussion.

Summary
    of Financial Performance

Operating
    Results

During Fiscal 2007, we reported revenues of $4.295 billion,
    net income of $400.9 million and net income per diluted
    share of $3.73. This compares to revenues of
    $3.746 billion, net income of $308.0 million and net
    income per diluted share of $2.87 during Fiscal 2006. Our strong
    Fiscal 2007 operating performance was primarily driven by 14.7%
    revenue growth led by our Wholesale and Retail segments
    (including the effect of certain acquisitions that occurred in
    Fiscal 2006) and gross profit percentage expansion of
    40 basis points to 54.4%. Excluding the effect of
    acquisitions, revenues increased by 10.0%. Operating income as a
    percentage of revenue increased 140 basis points to 15.2%
    during Fiscal 2007, reflecting our revenue growth, gross profit
    percentage expansion and improved leveraging of selling, general
    and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses. SG&A
    expenses included stock-based compensation costs reflecting the
    adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“FAS 123R”). Such costs were $43.6 million
    on a pre-tax basis ($26.1 million after-tax) in Fiscal
    2007, compared to $26.6 million on a pre-tax basis
    ($16.2 million after-tax) in Fiscal 2006. In turn, net
    income per diluted share was reduced by stock-based compensation
    costs in the amount of $0.24 per share during Fiscal 2007,
    compared to $0.15 per share during Fiscal 2006. Offsetting
    the higher stock-based compensation costs and contributing to
    the growth in net income and net income per diluted share was a
    net reduction in Fiscal 2007 of $19.0 million of pre-tax
    charges related to restructurings, asset impairments and credit
    card contingencies as compared to Fiscal 2006. See

“Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition”

described below for
    further discussion of these transactions.


See Note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the impact of
    adopting FAS 123R.

Financial
    Condition and Liquidity

Our financial position continues to reflect the strength of our
    business results. We ended Fiscal 2007 with a net cash position
    (total cash and cash equivalents less total debt) of
    $165.1 million, compared to $5.3 million at the end of
    Fiscal 2006. In addition, our stockholders’ equity
    increased to $2.335 billion as of March 31, 2007,
    compared to $2.050 billion as of April 1, 2006. During
    Fiscal 2007, we successfully completed the issuance of
    €300 million principal amount of 4.50% notes due
    October 4, 2013 (the “2006 Euro Debt”). We used
    the net proceeds from this issuance to repay approximately
    €227 million principal amount of Euro debt obligations
    that matured on November 22, 2006 (the “1999 Euro
    Debt”) and for general corporate and working capital
    purposes. Also, during Fiscal 2007, we took advantage of our
    recent credit rating upgrades and amended our credit facility to
    increase our borrowing capacity, lower our financing costs and
    eliminate certain financial covenants (see Note 13 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion).

We generated $796.1 million of cash from operations during
    Fiscal 2007, compared to $449.1 million in the prior fiscal
    year. Included in our cash from operations was approximately
    $180 million (net of certain refundable tax withholdings)
    of prepaid royalty and design-service fees from Luxottica Group,
    S.p.A. and affiliates (“Luxottica”) in connection with
    the start of our ten-year eyewear licensing agreement with
    Luxottica (see Note 22 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion). We
    used our higher cash availability to reinvest in our business
    through capital spending and acquisitions, as well as in
    connection with the expansion of our common stock repurchase
    program. In particular, we had $184 million of capital
    expenditures primarily associated with retail store expansion,
    construction and renovation of

shop-in-shops

in department stores and investments in our technological
    infrastructure. We used $175 million to acquire the
    remaining 50% equity interest in RL Media, our

e-commerce

subsidiary, that we did not previously own (see

“Recent
    Developments”

for further discussion). We also acquired
    3.5 million shares of Class A common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $231.3 million.

Transactions
    Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

The comparability of our operating results has been affected by
    certain acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal
    2005. In particular, we acquired the Polo Jeans Business on
    February 3, 2006, the Footwear Business on July 15,
    2005, and the Childrenswear Business on July 2, 2004 (each
    as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements). In addition, as noted above,
    the comparability of our operating results also has been
    affected by the change in accounting for stock-based
    compensation effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2007, and
    by certain pre-tax charges related to restructurings, asset
    impairments, and credit card and other litigation-related
    contingencies during the fiscal years presented. A summary of
    the effect of these items on pre-tax income for each period
    presented is noted below:

The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as
    necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising
    from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or
    transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and
    other financial statement users individually should consider the
    types of events and transactions that have affected operating
    trends.


Recent
    Developments

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company completed its previously
    announced transactions to acquire control of certain of its
    Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed
    arrangements. In particular, the Company acquired approximately
    77% of the outstanding shares of Impact 21 that it did not
    previously own in a cash tender offer (the “Impact 21
    Acquisition”), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact
    21 from approximately 20% to 97%. Impact 21 conducts the
    Company’s men’s, women’s and jeans apparel and
    accessories business in Japan under a

sub-license

arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (“PRL
    Japan”), which holds the master license to conduct
    Polo’s business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama Co. Ltd and
    its subsidiaries (“Onward Kashiyama”) and The Seibu
    Department Stores, Ltd (the “PRL Japan Minority Interest
    Acquisition”). Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and
    the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition are hereafter
    referred to as the “Japanese Business Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the Impact
    21 Acquisition was approximately $327 million. However, the
    Company intends to acquire, over the next several months, the
    remaining approximately 3% of the outstanding shares not
    exchanged as of the close of the tender offer period at an
    estimated aggregate cost of approximately $12 million. In
    addition, the purchase price paid in connection with the PRL
    Japan Minority Interest Acquisition was approximately
    $22 million.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and approximately $170 million of
    Yen-based borrowings under a one-year term loan agreement on
    terms substantially similar to the Company’s existing
    credit facility. The Company expects to repay the borrowing by
    its maturity date using a portion of the approximate
    $200 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as
    part of the acquisition.

The results of operations for Impact 21 will be consolidated
    effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008. The results of
    operations for PRL Japan already are consolidated by the Company
    as described further in Note 2 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements.

The Company is in the process of preparing its assessment of the
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the
    allocation of the purchase price. The Company also has entered
    into a transition services agreement with Onward Kashiyama
    which, along with its affiliates, was a former approximate 41%
    shareholder of Impact 21, to provide a variety of
    operational, human resources and information systems-related
    services over a period of up to two years.

The Company does not expect the results of the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions to contribute to its profitability until Fiscal
    2009 primarily due to the dilutive effect of the anticipated
    non-cash costs to be recognized in connection with the
    allocation of a portion of the purchase price to inventory and
    certain intangible assets.

Acquisition
    of Small Leathergoods Business

On April 13, 2007, the Company acquired from Kellwood
    Company (“Kellwood”) substantially all of the assets
    of New Campaign, Inc., the Company’s licensee for
    men’s and women’s belts and other small leather goods
    under the Ralph Lauren, Lauren and Chaps brands in the
    U.S. The assets acquired from Kellwood will be operated
    under the name of “Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods” and
    will allow the Company to further expand its accessories
    business. The acquisition cost was approximately
    $10 million and is subject to customary closing
    adjustments. Kellwood will provide various transition services
    for up to six months after the closing.

The results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods
    business will be consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing in Fiscal 2008.

Acquisition
    of RL Media Minority Interest

On March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    equity interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (“RL
    Media”) held by NBC Universal, Inc. and its related
    entities (37.5%) and Value Vision International, Inc. and its
    related entities (12.5%). RL Media conducts the Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through the Polo.com internet site and is
    consolidated by the Company as the primary beneficiary pursuant
    to the provisions of FIN 46R.


The acquisition cost was $175 million. In addition, Value
    Vision International, Inc. entered into a transition services
    agreement with the Company to provide order fulfillment and
    related services over a period of up to seventeen months from
    the date of the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest.

The Company expects the acquisition of the RL Media minority
    interest to have a dilutive effect on profitability in Fiscal
    2008 due primarily to the non-cash costs to be recognized in
    connection with the allocation of a portion of the purchase
    price to inventory and certain intangible assets.

Formation
    of Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Joint Venture

On March 5, 2007, the Company announced that it had agreed
    to form a joint venture with Financiere Richemont SA
    (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group. The

50-50

joint
    venture will be a Swiss corporation named the Ralph Lauren Watch
    and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL Watch
    Company”), whose purpose is to design, develop,
    manufacture, sell and distribute luxury watches and fine jewelry
    through Ralph Lauren boutiques, as well as through fine
    independent jewelry and luxury watch retailers throughout the
    world. The Company expects to account for its 50% interest in
    the RL Watch Company under the equity method of accounting.
    Royalty payments due to the Company under the related license
    agreement for use of certain of the Company’s trademarks
    will be reflected as licensing revenue within the consolidated
    statement of operations. The RL Watch Company is expected to
    commence operations during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008.

The Company expects to incur certain

start-up

costs in Fiscal 2008 to support the launch of this business.
    However, the business is not expected to generate any sales
    until Fiscal 2009 as products are scheduled to be launched in
    the fall of calendar 2008.

Global
    Brand Concepts and Launch of American Living

On January 8, 2007, the Company announced it will begin to
    develop new lifestyle brands for specialty and department stores
    through its Global Brand Concepts (“GBC”) group. The
    GBC group will work in partnership with select department and
    specialty stores and contribute its expertise in design,
    operations, marketing, merchandising and advertising in
    developing exclusive brands for those stores. Consistent with
    this strategic initiative, on February 1, 2007, the Company
    announced plans to launch

American Living

, a new
    lifestyle brand created exclusively for J.C. Penney Company,
    Inc. (“JCPenney”).

American Living

will include
    a full range of merchandise for women, men and children, as well
    as intimate apparel, accessories and home products.

The Company expects to incur certain

start-up

costs in Fiscal 2008 to support the launch of this new product
    line. However, the Company is not expected to generate any
    significant sales in Fiscal 2008 as the

American Living

product line is not scheduled to be available at JCPenney
    stores until the spring of calendar 2008.

Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement

In February 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into
    a ten-year exclusive licensing agreement with Luxottica Group,
    S.p.A. and affiliates (“Luxottica”) for the design,
    production, sale and distribution of prescription frames and
    sunglasses under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand (the “Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement”).

The Eyewear Licensing Agreement took effect on January 1,
    2007 after the Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement
    with another licensee expired. In early January, the Company
    received a prepayment of approximately $180 million, net of
    certain tax withholdings, in consideration of the annual minimum
    royalty and design-services fees to be earned over the life of
    the contract. The prepayment is non-refundable, except with
    respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the Company, in
    which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment as
    determined based on the specific terms of the agreement would be
    required to be repaid (see Note 22 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further
    discussion).

See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion of the
    Company’s acquisitions and joint venture formed during the
    fiscal years presented.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $549.1 million, or 14.7%, to $4.295 billion in Fiscal
    2007 from $3.746 billion in Fiscal 2006. The increase was
    experienced in all geographic regions and was due to a
    combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Wholesale
    revenues increased by $373.4 million, primarily as a result
    of revenues from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business, the
    successful launch of the new Chaps for women and children
    product lines, and increased sales in our global menswear and
    womenswear product lines. The increase in net revenues also was
    driven by a revenue increase of $184.6 million in our
    Retail segment as a result of improved comparable global retail
    store sales, continued store expansion (including our new Tokyo
    flagship store) and growth in Polo.com sales. Licensing revenue
    decreased by $8.9 million primarily due to the loss of
    product licensing


revenue related to the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses (now
    included as part of the Wholesale segment). Net revenues for our

Wholesale net sales

— the net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

the inclusion of $190 million of revenues from our newly
    acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses;

•

a $156 million aggregate net increase led by our global
    menswear, womenswear and childrenswear businesses, primarily
    driven by strong growth in our Lauren product line, increased
    full-price sell-through performance in our menswear business and
    the effects from the successful domestic launch of our new Chaps
    for women and children product lines. These increases were
    partially offset by a decline in footwear sales (excluding the
    impact from acquisition) due to our planned integration efforts
    as we repositioned the related product line; and

•

a $27 million increase in revenues due to a favorable
    foreign currency effect, primarily related to the strengthening
    of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2007.

Retail net sales

— For purposes of the
    discussion of retail operating performance below, we refer to
    the measure “comparable store sales.” Comparable store
    sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for
    at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing
    during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of
    comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either
    relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage
    expansion of 25% or greater) or closed for 30 or more
    consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the
    calculation of comparable store sales until stores have been in
    their location for at least a full fiscal year. Comparable store
    sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club
    Monaco stores.

The increase in retail net sales primarily reflects:

•

an aggregate $104 million increase in comparable full-price
    and factory store sales on a global basis. This increase was
    driven by a 6.6% increase in comparable full-price Ralph Lauren
    store sales, a 10.9% increase in comparable full-price Club
    Monaco store sales, and an 8.1% increase in comparable factory
    store sales. Excluding a net aggregate favorable $9 million
    effect on revenues from foreign currency exchange rates,
    comparable full-price Ralph Lauren store sales increased 5.7%,
    comparable full-price Club Monaco store sales increased 10.9%,
    and comparable factory store sales increased 7.5%;

•

an increase in sales from non-comparable stores, primarily
    relating to new store openings within the past fiscal year.
    There was a net increase in global store count of 3 stores
    compared to the prior fiscal year, to a total of 292 stores. The
    net increase in store count was primarily due to several new
    openings of full-price stores, partially offset by the closure
    of certain Club Monaco Caban Concept and factory stores and Polo
    Jeans factory stores; and

•

a $26 million increase in sales at Polo.com.

Licensing revenue

— the net decrease primarily
    reflects:

•

the loss of licensing revenues from our Polo Jeans and Footwear
    Businesses now included as part of the Wholesale segment;


•

a decline in eyewear-related royalties due to the wind-down of
    the Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement prior to the
    commencement of the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement which took
    effect on January 1, 2007;

•

a decline in Home licensing royalties; and

•

a partially offsetting increase in international licensing
    royalties and the accelerated receipt and recognition of
    approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and
    design-service fees in connection with the termination of a
    domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007.

Cost of Goods Sold.

Cost of goods sold
    increased by $235.3 million, or 13.7%, to
    $1.959 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $1.724 billion in
    Fiscal 2006. Cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net
    revenues decreased to 45.6% in Fiscal 2007 from 46.0% in Fiscal
    2006. The net reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of
    net revenues primarily reflects the ongoing focus on improved
    inventory management, including sourcing efficiencies and
    reduced markdown activity as a result of better full-price
    sell-through of our products.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased by
    $313.8 million, or 15.5%, to $2.336 billion in Fiscal
    2007 from $2.022 billion in Fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a
    percentage of net revenues also increased to 54.4% in Fiscal
    2007 from 54.0% in Fiscal 2006. The increase in gross profit
    reflected higher net sales and improved merchandise margins in
    our wholesale and retail businesses, including the continued
    emphasis on shifting the mix from off-price to full-price sales
    across our wholesale product lines, as well as the focus on
    improved inventory management discussed above. However, the
    overall improvement in gross profit margins was partially offset
    by the lower gross profit performance of our newly acquired Polo
    Jeans Business associated with the liquidation of existing
    inventory in anticipation of the redesign and launch of our new
    denim and casual sportswear product lines during spring of
    calendar 2007. Gross profit margins related to our Footwear
    Business have also been negatively impacted during Fiscal 2007,
    primarily by integration efforts as we repositioned the related
    product line.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses primarily include
    compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, information
    technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with
    finance and administration. SG&A expenses increased by
    $186.5 million, or 12.6%, to $1.663 billion in Fiscal
    2007 from $1.477 billion in Fiscal 2006. SG&A expenses
    as a percent of net revenues decreased to 38.7% in Fiscal 2007
    from 39.4% in Fiscal 2006. The 70 basis point improvement
    is primarily indicative of our ability to successfully leverage
    our global infrastructure as we acquire businesses and grow
    product lines organically. The $186.5 million net increase
    in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:

•

higher compensation-related expenses (excluding stock-based
    compensation) of approximately $69 million, principally
    relating to increased selling costs associated with higher
    retail sales and our ongoing worldwide retail store and product
    line expansion, and higher investment in infrastructure to
    support the ongoing growth of our businesses;

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs for our newly acquired Footwear
    and Polo Jeans Businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to
    transition service arrangements;

•

a $38 million increase in brand-related marketing and
    facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses;

•

an approximate $10 million increase in depreciation costs
    in connection with our increased capital expenditures and global
    expansion;

•

incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately
    $17 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R as
    of April 2, 2006 (see Note 18 to the accompanying
    audited consolidated financial statements for further
    discussion); and

•

a net reduction in credit card contingency charges of
    approximately $4 million.

The Company expects to incur significantly greater stock-based
    compensation expense in Fiscal 2008 as compared to the related
    expense recognized in Fiscal 2007 primarily due to the
    approximate 45% increase in the Company’s share price
    during Fiscal 2007.


Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $6.5 million, to $15.6 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $9.1 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase was due
    to the amortization of intangible assets related to the Polo
    Jeans Business acquired in February 2006 and the Footwear
    Business acquired in July 2005.

Impairments of Retail Assets.

A non-cash
    impairment charge of $10.8 million was recognized during
    Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets largely
    relating to our Club Monaco brand. No impairment charges were
    recognized in Fiscal 2007.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    decreased by $4.4 million, to $4.6 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $9.0 million in Fiscal 2006. Restructuring
    charges recognized in both periods were principally associated
    with the Club Monaco retail business. See Note 11 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    by $136.0 million, or 26.3%, to $652.6 million in
    Fiscal 2007 from $516.6 million in Fiscal 2006. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis
    points, to 15.2% in Fiscal 2007 from 13.8% in Fiscal 2006,
    reflecting our revenue growth, gross profit percentage expansion
    and improved SG&A expense leveraging. Operating income for
    our three business segments is provided below:

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $79.5 million, primarily as a result of higher net sales
    and improved gross margin rates in most product lines, as well
    as the incremental contribution from the newly acquired Polo
    Jeans Business and the new Chaps product lines. These increases
    were partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses in
    support of new product lines across all geographic territories
    and higher amortization expenses associated with intangible
    assets recognized in acquisitions.

Retail operating income

increased by $84.2 million,
    primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross
    margin rates, as well as the absence of a non-cash impairment
    charge of $10.8 million recognized in Fiscal 2006. These
    increases were partially offset by an increase in selling
    related salaries and associated costs in connection with the
    increase in retail sales, including Polo.com, and worldwide
    store expansion, including the new Tokyo flagship store.

Licensing operating income

decreased by
    $11.9 million primarily due to the loss of royalty income
    formerly collected in connection with the Footwear and Polo
    Jeans Businesses, which have now been acquired. The decline in
    Home royalties also contributed to the decrease along with the
    decline in eyewear royalties, due to the wind-down of the
    Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement. These decreases
    were partially offset by an increase in international royalties,
    as well as the accelerated receipt and recognition of
    approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and
    design-service fees in connection with the termination of a
    domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $24.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in
    brand-related marketing, payroll-related and facilities costs to
    support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The increase in


compensation-related costs includes higher stock-based
    compensation expense due to the adoption of FAS 123R (as
    further discussed in Note 18 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements).

Unallocated legal and restructuring charges

were
    $7.6 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to
    $16.1 million during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 charges were
    principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan
    charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 11 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and
    costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card Matters
    (as defined in Note 15 to the accompanying audited
    consolidated financial statements). Fiscal 2006 charges also
    primarily included the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of
    $9.0 million and legal costs of $6.8 million
    associated with the Credit Card Matters.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007, compared to a loss of
    $5.7 million in Fiscal 2006. The decrease in foreign
    currency losses compared to the prior fiscal year is due to the
    timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and
    payables (that were not of a long-term investment nature)
    between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries.
    Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of
    changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating
    results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to
    U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    the borrowing cost of our outstanding debt, including
    amortization of debt issuance costs and the loss (gain) on
    interest rate swap hedging contracts. Interest expense increased
    by $9.1 million to $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from
    $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase is primarily due
    to an increase in interest on capitalized leases due to
    additional obligations in Fiscal 2007 compared to the prior
    fiscal year and overlapping interest on debt during the period
    between the issuance of the 2006 Euro Debt and the repayment of
    the 1999 Euro Debt. In addition, prior year interest expense was
    favorably impacted by the interest rate swap agreements which
    were terminated at the end of Fiscal 2006.

Interest Income.

Interest income increased by
    $12.4 million, to $26.1 million in Fiscal 2007 from
    $13.7 million in Fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily
    driven by higher average interest rates and higher balances on
    our invested excess cash.

Equity in Income of Equity-Method
    Investees.

Equity in the income of equity-method
    investees decreased by $1.3 million, to $3.0 million
    in Fiscal 2007 from $4.3 million in Fiscal 2006. This
    income relates to our 20% investment in Impact 21, a
    company that holds the sublicense with PRL Japan for our
    men’s, women’s and jeans businesses in Japan. See

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion of
    the Company’s Japanese Business Acquisitions that occurred
    in May 2007.

Minority Interest Expense.

Minority interest
    expense increased by $1.8 million, to $15.3 million in
    Fiscal 2007 from $13.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The net
    increase is primarily related to the improved operating
    performance of RL Media compared to the prior period and the
    associated allocation of income to the minority partners. As of
    March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in RL Media held by the minority partners (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion).

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income
    taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by
    $47.5 million, or 24.4%, to $242.4 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006. This increase is a
    result of the increase in our pre-tax income, partially offset
    by a decrease in our reported effective tax rate, to 37.7% in
    Fiscal 2007 from 38.8% in Fiscal 2006. The lower effective tax
    rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, which
    resulted in more income being taxed at lower rates than in the
    previous fiscal year. The effective tax rate differs from
    statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax
    rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible
    expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from

year-to-year

based on non-recurring and recurring factors including, but not
    limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and
    amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and
    local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the
    interaction of various global tax strategies. See “Critical
    Accounting Policies” for a discussion on the accounting for
    uncertain tax positions and the Company’s adoption of
    FIN 48 in Fiscal 2008.

Net Income.

Net income increased by
    $92.9 million, or 30.2%, to $400.9 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $308.0 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase in
    net income principally related to our $136.0 million
    increase in operating income, as previously discussed, offset in
    part by an increase of $47.5 million in our provision for
    income taxes.


Net Income Per Diluted Share.

Net income per
    diluted share increased by $0.86, or 30.0%, to $3.73 per
    share in Fiscal 2007 from $2.87 per share in Fiscal 2006.
    The increase in diluted per share results was primarily due to
    the higher level of net income, partially offset by higher
    weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for Fiscal 2007.

    2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Net Revenues.

Net revenues increased by
    $440.9 million, or 13.3%, to $3.746 billion in Fiscal
    2006 from $3.305 billion in Fiscal 2005. Wholesale revenues
    increased by $230.4 million, primarily as a result of
    revenues from the sale of newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans
    products, the inclusion of a full year of sales for our
    childrenswear business, which was acquired in July 2004 (the
    “Childrenswear Business”), the successful launch of
    the Chaps for women and boys product lines, and increased sales
    in our global menswear and womenswear product lines. The
    increase in net revenues also was due to a $210.0 million
    revenue increase in our Retail segment as a


result of improved comparable retail store sales, continued
    store expansion and growth in Polo.com sales. Net revenues for
    our three business segments are provided below:

Wholesale net sales

— the net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

the inclusion of $58 million of revenue from the newly
    acquired Footwear Business;

•

the inclusion of $35 million of revenues from the newly
    acquired Polo Jeans Business;

•

a $74 million increase in revenues from our childrenswear
    product line that was acquired in July 2004, including the
    effects from the successful launch of our Chaps for boys product
    line and a one-time benefit of $59 million due to the
    inclusion of a full year of sales in Fiscal 2006;

•

a $73 million aggregate constant-dollar increase in our
    global menswear and womenswear businesses, primarily driven by
    strong growth in our Lauren product line and the effects from
    the successful domestic launch of our Chaps for women product
    line; and

•

a $14 million decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable
    foreign currency effect relating to the strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro during Fiscal 2006.

Retail net sales

— the net increase primarily
    reflects:

•

an aggregate $74 million increase in comparable full-price
    and factory store sales. This increase was driven by a 6.0%
    increase in comparable full-price Ralph Lauren store sales, a
    8.1% increase in comparable full-price Club Monaco store sales,
    and a 6.3% increase in comparable factory store sales. Excluding
    an unfavorable aggregate $4 million effect on revenues from
    foreign currency exchange rates, comparable full-price Ralph
    Lauren store sales increased 6.6%, comparable full-price Club
    Monaco store sales increased 8.1%, and comparable factory store
    sales increased 6.6%;

•

a net increase in global store count of 11 stores compared to
    the prior year, to a total of 289 stores, as several new
    openings were offset by the closure of certain Club Monaco
    stores in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006; and

•

a $29 million increase in sales at Polo.com.

Licensing revenues

— Licensing revenues were
    essentially flat in Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005, as
    increased revenue from our international licensing business and
    the domestic launch of the Chaps brand extensions for the
    menswear and accessories businesses offset the decreases in
    product licensing revenue resulting from our Fiscal 2006
    purchase of the Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses (now included
    as part of the Wholesale segment).

Cost of Goods Sold.

Cost of goods sold
    increased by $103.0 million, or 6.4%, to
    $1.724 billion in Fiscal 2006 from $1.621 billion in
    Fiscal 2005. Cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net
    revenues decreased to 46.0% in Fiscal 2006 from 49.0% in Fiscal
    2005. The net reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of
    net revenues primarily reflected a continued focus on sourcing
    efficiencies and reduced markdown activity as a result of better
    full-price sell-through of our products.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased by
    $337.9 million, or 20.1%, to $2.022 billion in Fiscal
    2006 from $1.685 billion in Fiscal 2005. This increase
    reflected higher net sales, improved merchandise margins and
    sourcing efficiencies, generally across our wholesale and retail
    businesses. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues also


increased to 54.0% in Fiscal 2006 from 51.0% in Fiscal 2005.
    This 300 basis point increase resulted primarily from the
    factors discussed above and a shift in mix away from off-price
    sales towards more full-price sales in our Wholesale segment.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A expenses increased by
    $99.3 million, or 7.2%, to $1.477 billion in Fiscal
    2006 from $1.378 billion in Fiscal 2005. SG&A expenses
    in Fiscal 2005 included a $100 million charge in connection
    with the Jones-related Litigation. On a reported basis,
    SG&A as a percent of net revenues decreased by 2.2%, to
    39.4% in Fiscal 2006 from 41.7% in Fiscal 2005. However,
    excluding the effect from the Jones-related Litigation charge,
    SG&A as a percentage of net revenues increased by 0.8%, to
    39.4% in Fiscal 2006 from 38.7% in Fiscal 2005. Excluding the
    Jones-related Litigation charge, the $199.3 million net
    increase in SG&A was primarily driven by:

•

higher payroll-related expenses of approximately
    $89 million, principally related to increased selling costs
    associated with higher retail sales and our worldwide retail
    store expansion, higher stock-based compensation charges
    associated with our strong operating performance and increasing
    stock price, and higher investment in infrastructure to support
    the ongoing growth of our businesses;

•

an increase in brand-related marketing and facilities costs of
    approximately $69 million to support the ongoing growth of
    our businesses;

•

higher depreciation costs of approximately $19 million in
    connection with our increased capital expenditures and global
    expansion; and

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs for our newly acquired Footwear
    and Polo Jeans Businesses, and the costs for the Childrenswear
    Business for a full year.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased by $5.7 million, to $9.1 million in Fiscal
    2006 from $3.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase related
    to the addition of intangible assets acquired as part of the
    Childrenswear Business in July 2004, the Footwear Business in
    July 2005 and the Polo Jeans Business in February 2006.

Impairments of Retail Assets.

A non-cash
    impairment charge of $10.8 million was recognized during
    Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets used in
    certain of our retail stores, largely related to our Club Monaco
    retail business that includes our Caban Concept and Club Monaco
    factory stores. This impairment charge primarily related to

lower-than-expected

store performance and preceded the implementation of a plan to
    restructure these operations in February 2006. A
    $1.5 million impairment charge also was recognized in
    Fiscal 2005 related to Club Monaco retail stores.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    increased by $6.7 million, to $9.0 million in Fiscal
    2006 from $2.3 million in Fiscal 2005. The Fiscal 2006
    restructuring charge related to the Club Monaco retail business
    and included the intended closure of all five Club Monaco
    factory stores and the intended disposal of all eight of Club
    Monaco’s Caban Concept stores. The Fiscal 2005
    restructuring charge principally related to severance
    obligations incurred in connection with a consolidation of our
    European operations.


Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    by $216.9 million, or 72.4%, to $516.6 million in
    Fiscal 2006 from $299.7 million in Fiscal 2005. Operating
    income for Fiscal 2005 was reduced by the $100 million
    Jones-related Litigation charge. Operating income for our three
    business segments is provided below:

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $98.6 million, primarily as a result of higher sales and
    improved gross margin rates, partially offset by increases in
    SG&A expenses and higher amortization expenses associated
    with intangible assets recognized in acquisitions.

Retail operating income

increased by $57.2 million,
    primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross
    margin rates. These increases were partially offset by an
    increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection
    with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion,
    along with higher retail store impairment charges.

Licensing operating income

decreased by
    $6.0 million, primarily due to the loss of royalty income
    formerly collected in connection with the Footwear, Polo Jeans,
    and Childrenswear Businesses, which have now been acquired. This
    decrease was partially offset by improved sell-through in our
    international licensing businesses.

Unallocated corporate expenses

increased by
    $25.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in
    brand-related marketing, payroll-related and facilities costs to
    support the ongoing growth of our businesses.

Unallocated legal and restructuring
    charges.

Unallocated legal and restructuring
    charges decreased by $92.4 million, to $16.1 million
    in Fiscal 2006 from $108.5 million in Fiscal 2005.
    Unallocated legal and restructuring charges included a
    $100 million Jones-related Litigation charge in Fiscal
    2005. No related charge was recognized in Fiscal 2006. The
    decrease was offset in part by higher restructuring charges of
    $9.0 million related to the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan
    and legal costs of $6.8 million associated with the credit
    card contingency recognized in Fiscal 2006.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $5.7 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to a
    $6.1 million gain during Fiscal 2005. The increased losses
    in Fiscal 2006 primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange
    movements associated with intercompany receivables and payables
    that were not of a long-term investment nature and were settled
    by our international subsidiaries. These gains and losses are
    unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the
    U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased
    by $1.5 million, to $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006 from
    $11.0 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase was principally
    related to higher variable interest rates during the year under
    our interest rate swap agreements that were subsequently
    terminated.

Interest Income.

Interest income increased by
    $9.1 million, to $13.7 million in Fiscal 2006 from
    $4.6 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase principally
    related to a higher level of excess cash reinvestment and higher
    interest rates on our investments during Fiscal 2006.


Equity in Income of Equity-Method
    Investees.

Equity in the income of equity-method
    investees decreased by $2.1 million, to $4.3 million
    in Fiscal 2006 from $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The
    decrease principally related to higher amortization in Fiscal
    2006 of a basis difference associated with our 20% investment in
    Impact 21. See

“Recent Developments”

for
    further discussion of the Company’s Japanese Business
    Acquisitions that occurred in May 2007.

Minority Interest Expense.

Minority interest
    expense increased by $5.5 million, to $13.5 million in
    Fiscal 2006 from $8.0 million in Fiscal 2005. The net
    increase is primarily related to the improved operating
    performance of RL Media compared to the prior period and the
    associated allocation of income to the minority partners. As of
    March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in RL Media held by the minority partners (see

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion).

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes increased by $87.5 million, or 81.5%, to
    $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006 from $107.4 million in
    Fiscal 2005. This increase is a result of an increase in our
    effective tax rate to 38.8% in Fiscal 2006 from 36.1% in Fiscal
    2005, as well as the increase in our pre-tax income. The
    increase in our effective tax rate principally resulted from the
    continued growth of our domestic wholesale and retail
    businesses, which led to a higher state tax impact.

Net Income.

Net income increased by
    $117.6 million, or 61.8%, to $308.0 million in Fiscal
    2006 from $190.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase in
    net income principally related to the $216.9 million
    increase in operating income previously discussed, including the
    effect of the $100 million Jones-related Litigation charge
    recognized in Fiscal 2005. These benefits were offset in part by
    higher foreign currency losses of $11.8 million and higher
    taxes of $87.5 million.

Net Income Per Diluted Share.

Net income per
    diluted share increased by $1.04, or 56.8%, to $2.87 in Fiscal
    2006 from $1.83 in Fiscal 2005. The improvement in diluted per
    share results was due to the higher level of net income and the
    absence of the $100 million Jones-related Litigation charge
    recognized in Fiscal 2005, offset in part by higher dilution
    associated with higher average shares outstanding in Fiscal 2006.

The increase in the Company’s net cash position principally
    relates to its growth in operating cash flows (including
    approximately $180 million of net proceeds received in
    conjunction with the Eyewear Licensing Agreement) and the excess
    proceeds raised through the third-quarter refinancing of its
    Euro debt, partially offset by the $175 million use of cash
    to fund the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in
    RL Media that it did not previously own, $184 million of
    capital expenditures and $231 million to repurchase shares
    of common stock in connection with its common stock repurchase
    program. The increase in stockholders’ equity principally
    relates to the Company’s strong earnings growth during
    Fiscal 2007 and proceeds received from the exercise of stock
    options, offset in part by the effects from its common stock
    repurchase program.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $796.1 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to
    $449.1 million for Fiscal 2006. This $347.0 million
    increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by the
    increase in net income, the receipt of approximately
    $180 million under the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement (net
    of certain tax withholdings) and the absence of the
    $100 million payment to settle the Jones-related Litigation
    in Fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher tax payments made in
    Fiscal 2007. Also offsetting the increase in operating cash flow
    was an increase in working capital needs during Fiscal 2007,
    primarily as a result of recent expansions and the overall
    growth in the business. This increase was partially offset by a
    decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding as a
    result of improved cash collections in the Company’s
    Wholesale segment. On a comparative basis, operating cash flows
    were reduced by $33.7 million as a result of a change in
    the reporting of excess tax benefits from stock-based
    compensation arrangements. That is, prior to the adoption of
    FAS 123R, benefits of tax deductions in excess of
    recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash
    flows. FAS 123R requires excess tax benefits to be reported
    as a financing cash inflow rather than in operating cash flows
    as a reduction of taxes paid.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $434.6 million for
    Fiscal 2007, as compared to $539.2 million for Fiscal 2006.
    The net decrease in cash used in investing activities is
    primarily due to acquisition-related activities. In Fiscal 2007,
    the Company used $175 million to fund the acquisition of
    the remaining 50% equity interest in RL Media that it did not
    previously own, whereas in Fiscal 2006, approximately
    $380 million was used primarily to fund the acquisition of
    the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses. In addition, net cash
    used in investing activities for Fiscal 2007 included
    $74.5 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with
    certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees of a
    corresponding amount made by the banks to certain international
    tax authorities on behalf of the Company (see Note 3 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion). Net cash used in investing activities also
    included $184.0 million relating to capital expenditures,
    as compared to $158.6 million in the comparable prior year.

Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Financing
    Activities.

Net cash used in financing activities
    was $95.2 million for Fiscal 2007, compared to net cash
    provided by financing activities of $33.5 million in Fiscal
    2006. The increase in net cash used in financing activities
    during Fiscal 2007 principally related to the repayment of
    approximately €227 million principal amount
    ($291.6 million) of the Company’s 1999 Euro Debt and
    the repurchase of 3.5 million shares of Class A common
    stock pursuant to its common stock repurchase program at a cost
    of $231.3 million. Partially offsetting the increase was
    the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of
    €300 million principal amount (approximately
    $380 million) of 2006 Euro Debt. This net increase in cash
    used in financing activities was partially offset by the change
    in the reporting of excess tax benefits from stock-based
    compensation arrangements of $33.7 million.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $449.1 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $382.0 million in Fiscal 2005. This $67.1 million
    increase in cash flow was driven primarily by an increase in net
    income and lower working capital requirements, partially offset
    by a $100 million payment to settle the Jones-related
    Litigation. The lower working capital requirements in Fiscal
    2006 primarily related to a decrease in accounts receivable days
    sales outstanding as a result of improved cash collections in
    the Company’s Wholesale segment, partially offset by higher
    inventory balances primarily due to the newly acquired Polo
    Jeans and Footwear Businesses.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was $539.2 million in
    Fiscal 2006, compared to $417.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The
    increase in cash used in investing activities principally
    related to acquisition-related activities. In Fiscal 2006, the
    Company used approximately $380 million primarily to fund
    the acquisition of the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses,
    whereas in Fiscal 2005, approximately $243 million was used
    principally to fund the acquisition of the Childrenswear
    Business. In addition, net cash used in investing activities
    included capital expenditures of $158.6 million in Fiscal
    2006, compared to $174.1 million in Fiscal 2005.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.

Net
    cash provided by financing activities was $33.5 million in
    Fiscal 2006, compared to $31.5 million in Fiscal 2005. The
    $2.0 million increase in cash provided by financing
    activities was primarily related to the settlement of an
    interest rate swap agreement and an increase in proceeds
    received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by
    the cost associated with repurchases of common stock. The
    Company repurchased common stock under its common stock
    repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately
    $4 million in Fiscal 2006. No shares of common stock were
    repurchased in Fiscal 2005. Proceeds received from the exercise
    of stock options were approximately $55 million in Fiscal
    2006, compared to approximately $53 million in Fiscal 2005.
    Cash dividends paid were approximately $21 million in
    Fiscal 2006, compared to approximately $22 million in
    Fiscal 2005.

Liquidity

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are the cash
    flow generated from its operations, $450 million of
    availability under its credit facility, available cash and
    equivalents and other potential sources of financial capacity
    relating to its under-leveraged capital structure. These sources
    of liquidity are needed to fund the Company’s ongoing cash
    requirements, including working capital requirements, retail
    store expansion, construction and renovation of

shop-in-shops,

investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions,
    dividends, debt repayment, stock repurchases and other corporate
    activities. Management believes that the Company’s existing
    resources of cash will be sufficient to support its operating
    and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including
    the acquisitions and plans for business expansion discussed
    above under the section entitled

“Recent
    Developments

.”

As discussed below under the section entitled

“Debt and
    Covenant Compliance,”

the Company had no borrowings
    under its credit facility as of March 31, 2007. However, as
    discussed further below, the Company may elect to draw on its
    credit facility or other potential sources of financing for,
    among other things, a material acquisition, settlement of a
    material contingency or a material adverse business development.
    Also, as discussed below, in October 2006, the Company completed
    the issuance of €300 million principal amount of 2006
    Euro Debt. The Company used the net proceeds from the financing
    to repay approximately €227 principal amount of its 1999
    Euro Debt. The balance of such proceeds was used for general
    corporate and working capital purposes. The


Company also amended its Credit Facility in November 2006, which
    extended the term to 2011, as a result of recent upgrades in the
    Company’s credit ratings from Standard & Poors
    (to BBB+) and Moody’s (to Baa1). See “Revolving Credit
    Facility” described below.

In May 2007, the Company completed the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions. These transactions were funded with available cash
    on-hand and approximately $170 million of Yen-based
    borrowings under a one-year term loan agreement on terms
    substantially similar to the Company’s existing credit
    facility (the “Term Loan”). Borrowings under the Term
    Loan bear interest at a LIBOR rate for yen loans for an interest
    period of 12 months plus the applicable margin. The
    maturity date of the Term Loan is on the

12-month

anniversary of the drawing date of the Term Loan. The Company
    expects to repay the borrowing by its maturity date using a
    portion of Impact 21’s cash on-hand of approximately
    $200 million acquired as part of the acquisition.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

In November 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    an expansion of the Company’s existing common stock
    repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase up to
    $500 million of Class A common stock. Repurchases of
    shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall
    business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2007, share
    repurchases under the expanded and pre-existing programs
    amounted to 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock
    at a cost of $231.3 million. The remaining availability
    under the common stock repurchase program was
    $368.3 million as of March 31, 2007.

In Fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 69.3 thousand shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of approximately
    $4 million. No shares of Class A common stock were
    repurchased in Fiscal 2005.

Dividends

The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly
    dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision
    to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
    discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will
    depend on, among other things, the Company’s results of
    operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other
    factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per
    outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal
    2006. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was
    $21 million in Fiscal 2007, $21 million in Fiscal 2006
    and $22 million in Fiscal 2005.

Debt
    and Covenant Compliance

Euro
    Debt

The Company had outstanding approximately €227 million
    principal amount of 6.125% notes that were due on
    November 22, 2006, from an original issuance of
    €275 million in 1999 (the “1999 Euro Debt”).
    On October 5, 2006, the Company completed a new issuance of
    €300 million principal amount of 4.50% notes due
    October 4, 2013 (the “2006 Euro Debt”). The
    Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the financing of
    approximately $380 million (based on the exchange rate in
    effect upon issuance) to repay the remaining 1999 Euro Debt at
    par on its maturity date. The balance of such net proceeds was
    used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The
    Company has the option to redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at
    any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount
    plus a premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of
    the 2006 Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest, in
    the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax law.
    Partial redemption of the 2006 Euro Debt is not permitted in
    either instance. In the event of a change of control of the
    Company, each holder of the 2006 Euro Debt has the option to
    require the Company to redeem the 2006 Euro Debt at its
    principal amount plus accrued interest.

As of March 31, 2007, the carrying value of the 2006 Euro
    Debt was $398.8 million.


Revolving
    Credit Facility and Term Loan

The Company has a credit facility, which was amended on
    November 28, 2006, that provides for a $450 million
    unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Credit
    Facility”). The Credit Facility also is used to support the
    issuance of letters of credit. As of March 31, 2007, there
    were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, but
    the Company was contingently liable for $25.7 million of
    outstanding letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory
    purchase commitments).

The Company amended certain terms of its Credit Facility as a
    result of recent upgrades in its credit ratings from
    Standard & Poors and Moody’s. Key changes under
    the amendment include:

•

An increase in the ability of the Company to expand its
    additional borrowing availability from $525 million to
    $600 million, subject to the agreement of one or more new
    or existing lenders under the facility to increase their
    commitments;

•

An extension of the term of the Credit Facility to November 2011
    from October 2009;

•

A reduction in the margin over LIBOR paid by the Company on
    amounts drawn under the Credit Facility to 35 basis points
    from 50 basis points;

•

A reduction in the commitment fee for the unutilized portion of
    the Credit Facility to 8 basis points from 12.5 basis
    points; and

•

The elimination of the coverage ratio financial covenant.

There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing availability
    throughout the term of the Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility
    (“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

The Credit Facility was amended as of May 22, 2007 to
    provide for the addition of a loan in a Japanese yen amount
    equal to approximately $170 million. The Term Loan was made
    to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    and is guaranteed by the Company, as well as the other
    subsidiaries of the Company which currently guarantee the Credit
    Facility. The proceeds of the Term Loan have been used to
    finance the Tender Offer and the total related acquisition cost
    and the acquisition by the Company of the remaining 50% of the
    shares of PRL Japan the Company did not previously own.
    Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a LIBOR rate for
    yen loans for an interest period of 12 months plus the
    applicable margin. The maturity date of the Term Loan is on the

12-month

anniversary of the drawing date of the Term Loan. The Company
    expects to repay the borrowing by its maturity date using a
    portion of Impact 21’s cash on-hand of approximately
    $200 million acquired as part of the acquisition. See

“Recent Developments”

for further discussion of
    the Japanese Business Acquisitions.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the
    Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to
    Consolidated EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”), as such
    terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of March 31,
    2007, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to
    the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s
    Credit Facility.


Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenant described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of
    Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities fail
    to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power
    of the Company’s common stock.

The following is a description of the Company’s material,
    firmly committed contractual obligations as of March 31,
    2007:

•

Euro Debt

represents the principal amount due at maturity
    of the Company’s outstanding Euro Debt on a
    U.S. dollar-equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any
    fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments;

•

Lease Obligations

represent the minimum lease rental
    payments under noncancelable leases for the Company’s real
    estate and operating equipment in various locations around the
    world. Approximately 67% of these lease obligations relates to
    the Company’s retail operations. Information has been
    presented separately for operating and capital leases. In
    addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to
    pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased
    real estate properties; and

•

Inventory Purchase Commitments

represent the
    Company’s legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or
    minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices.

The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would
    require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See
    Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements for a description of the Company’s contingent
    commitments not included in the above table.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company’s off-balance sheet firm commitments, which
    include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding
    commitments to investees, amounted to approximately
    $35.9 million as of March 31, 2007. At the end of
    Fiscal 2007, the Company also was committed to pay a purchase
    price of approximately $10 million in connection with the
    acquisition of New Campaign, which closed in April 2007.

The Company does not maintain any other off-balance sheet
    arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships
    with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a
    material current or future effect upon its financial condition
    or results of operations.


MARKET
    RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows generated by
    its international operations and possible declines in the fair
    value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign
    operations, as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of
    its fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, the Company periodically uses derivative financial
    instruments to manage such risks. The Company does not enter
    into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The
    Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of,
    the financial institutions that are party to any of its
    financial transactions. Credit risk related to derivative
    financial instruments is considered low because the agreements
    are entered into with strong creditworthy counterparties. The
    following is a summary of the Company’s risk management
    strategies and the effect of those strategies on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as
    hedges primarily relating to identifiable currency positions to
    reduce its risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory
    purchases and intercompany royalty payments made by certain of
    its international operations. As part of its overall strategy to
    manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily exposure to changes in the
    value of the Euro and the Japanese Yen, the Company hedges a
    portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the
    ensuing twelve-month to two-year period. In doing so, the
    Company uses foreign exchange contracts that generally have
    maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing
    coverage throughout the hedging period.

As of March 31, 2007, the Company had contracts for the
    sale of $214 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates.
    Of these $214 million of sales contracts, $180 million
    were for the sale of Euros and $34 million were for the
    sale of Japanese Yen. The total fair value of the forward
    contracts was an unrealized loss of $1.9 million. As of
    April 1, 2006, the Company had contracts for the sale of
    $90 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these
    $90 million of sales contracts, $22 million were for
    the sale of Euros and $68 million were for the sale of
    Japanese Yen. The total fair value of the forward contracts was
    an unrealized loss of $1.8 million.

The Company records foreign currency exchange contracts at fair
    value in its balance sheet and designates these derivative
    instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and
    subsequent amendments (collectively, “FAS 133”).
    As such, the related gains or losses on these contracts are
    deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains and
    losses are then either recognized in income in the period in
    which the related royalties being hedged are received, or in the
    case of inventory purchases, recognized as part of the cost of
    the inventory being hedged when sold. However, to the extent
    that any of these foreign currency exchange contracts are not
    considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in
    the value of the royalties or inventory purchases being hedged,
    any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of
    these contracts are immediately recognized in earnings. No
    significant gains or losses relating to ineffective hedges were
    recognized in the periods presented.

The Company had deferred net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in the amount of approximately $2 million at the
    end of Fiscal 2007, all of which is expected to be recognized in
    earnings in Fiscal 2008. Net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in the amount of approximately $1 million were
    deferred at the end of Fiscal 2006. The Company recognized net
    gains on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of
    approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2007 and
    $5 million for Fiscal 2006.

Based on the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as
    of March 31, 2007, a 10% devaluation of the
    U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign currency
    exchange rates for currencies under contract as of
    March 31, 2007 would result in approximately
    $19 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10%
    appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in
    approximately $19 million of net unrealized gains. Because
    the foreign currency exchange contracts are designated as cash
    flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized loss or
    gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation would be
    largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items.


Subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into
    foreign currency option contracts with a notional value of
    $159 million for the right, but not the obligation, to
    purchase foreign currencies at fixed rates. These contracts
    hedged the majority of the foreign currency exposure related to
    the financing of the Japanese Business Acquisitions, but do not
    qualify under FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. The
    Company will recognize a gain or loss, limited to the premium
    paid for the option contracts, upon the settlement of the
    contracts during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

Prior to the Company’s repayment of the 1999 Euro Debt in
    November 2006, the entire principal amount was designated as a
    hedge of the Company’s net investment in certain of its
    European subsidiaries in accordance with FAS 133.
    Contemporaneous with this repayment, the Company designated the
    entire principal amount of the 2006 Euro Debt, issued in October
    2006 (see Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion), as a hedge of its
    net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. As
    required by FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a
    derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial instrument
    (such as debt) that is designated as, and is effective as, a
    hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in
    the same manner as a translation adjustment under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, “Foreign
    Currency Translation,” to the extent it is effective as a
    hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the 1999 Euro Debt
    and the 2006 Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro
    exchange rate have been, and continue to be, reported in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. The Company recorded aggregate gains
    (losses), net of tax, in stockholders’ equity on the
    translation of the 1999 Euro Debt and 2006 Euro Debt to
    U.S. dollars in the amount of approximately
    $(19) million for Fiscal 2007, $4 million for Fiscal
    2006 and $(18) million for Fiscal 2005.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

Historically, the Company has used floating-rate interest rate
    swap agreements to hedge changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate 1999 Euro Debt. These interest rate swap agreements,
    which effectively converted fixed interest rate payments on the
    Company’s 1999 Euro Debt to a floating-rate basis, were
    designated as a fair value hedge in accordance with
    FAS 133. All interest rate swap agreements were terminated
    in late Fiscal 2006 and there were no outstanding agreements at
    the end of Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006.

During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered
    into three forward-starting interest rate swap contracts
    aggregating €200 million notional amount of
    indebtedness in anticipation of the Company’s proposed
    refinancing of the 1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in
    October 2006. The Company designated these agreements as a cash
    flow hedge of a forecasted transaction to issue new debt in
    connection with the planned refinancing of its 1999 Euro Debt.
    The interest rate swaps hedged a total of
    €200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest
    rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of
    the three interest swap contracts, the Company paid a
    weighted-average fixed rate of interest of 4.1% and received
    variable interest based upon six-month EURIBOR. The Company
    terminated the swaps on September 28, 2006, which was the
    date the interest rate for the 2006 Euro Debt was determined. As
    a result, the Company made a payment of approximately
    €3.5 million ($4.4 million based on the exchange
    rate in effect on that date) in settlement of the swaps. An
    amount of $0.2 million was recognized as a loss for the
    three months ending September 30, 2006 due to the partial
    ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result of the
    forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006 instead
    of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999 Euro
    Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million has been deferred
    as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders’
    equity and is being recognized in income as an adjustment to
    interest expense over the seven-year term of the 2006 Euro Debt.

As of March 31, 2007, the Company had no variable-rate debt
    outstanding. As such, the Company’s exposure to changes in
    interest rates primarily related to its fixed-rate 2006 Euro
    Debt. As of March 31, 2007, the carrying value of the 2006
    Euro Debt was $398.8 million and the fair value was
    $394.7 million. A 25 basis point increase or decrease
    in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or
    increase the fair value of the 2006 Euro Debt by approximately
    $5 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based
    on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in euro
    currency exchange rates and an immediate

across-the-board

increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no
    other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.


CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 60,
    “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
    Accounting Policies” (“FRR 60”), suggests
    companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those
    accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers
    an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations and
    requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of
    management in its application. The Company’s estimates are
    often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions
    that we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently
    uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other
    professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts
    and circumstances, could develop and support a range of
    alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the
    following list represents its critical accounting policies as
    contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the
    Company’s significant accounting policies, see Notes 3
    and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
    statements.

Sales
    Allowances and Uncollectible Accounts

A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and
    net income is estimating the portion of revenues and related
    receivables that are not realizable. In particular, wholesale
    revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue,
    including

e-commerce

sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns.

In determining estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks, management
    analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic
    and market conditions and retailer performance. The Company
    reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The
    Company’s historical estimates of these costs have not
    differed materially from actual results.

Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to
    determine if they will ultimately be collected. In performing
    this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are
    included, including an analysis of specific risks on a

customer-by-customer

basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging
    analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has
    historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this
    information, management provides a reserve for the estimated
    amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management
    believes that the Company’s major customers are sound and
    creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business
    operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on
    the Company’s net sales, cash flows

and/or

financial condition.

See “Accounts Receivable” under Note 3 to the
    accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an
    analysis of the activity in the Company’s reserves for
    sales allowances and uncollectible accounts for each of the
    three fiscal years presented.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning, ongoing product, as well as
    all fashion product. Estimated realizable value of distressed
    inventory is determined based on historical sales trends of the
    Company’s individual product lines for this category of
    inventory, the impact of market trends and economic conditions,
    and the value of current orders in-house relating to the future
    sales of this category of inventory. Estimates may differ from
    actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in
    inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market
    conditions. The Company’s historical estimates of these
    costs and its provisions have not differed materially from
    actual results.


Purchase
    Accounting

The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the
    purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of
    acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on
    their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the
    purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets
    acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires
    management’s judgment and often involves the use of
    significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions
    with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount
    rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items.

In addition, in connection with its recent business
    acquisitions, the Company has settled certain pre-existing
    relationships. These pre-existing relationships include
    licensing agreements and litigation in the case of the
    acquisition of the Polo Jeans Business. In accordance with the
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 04-1,

“Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the
    Parties to a Business Combination,” the Company is required
    to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these
    transactions between the value of the business acquired and the
    value of the settlement of any pre-existing relationships in
    proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the
    terms of the pre-existing relationships were determined to not
    be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be
    recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is
    required to determine the respective fair values of the business
    acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre-existing
    relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent
    valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”). Under
    FAS 142, goodwill, including any goodwill included in the
    carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed
    to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather,
    goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are
    assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons
    of their respective fair values to their carrying values.
    Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their
    respective estimated useful lives and, along with other
    long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“FAS 144”).

In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is
    determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by
    comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book
    value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
    of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the
    second step of the impairment test is unnecessary to be
    performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
    its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test
    is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
    The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the
    implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with
    the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair
    value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an
    amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill
    is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill
    recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of
    the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and
    liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible
    assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
    combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to
    acquire the reporting unit.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first
    step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair
    value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit
    (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step
    of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and
    often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
    Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the
    fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
    impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any
    such charge. To assist management in the process of determining
    goodwill impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from
    independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are
    primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market
    comparisons and recent transactions. These


approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including
    projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates
    reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual
    growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables.

The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
    asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
    In addition, in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for
    recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future
    cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and
    eventual disposition in accordance with FAS 144. To the
    extent the estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows
    attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted
    cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference.

There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with
    the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other
    intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented.

Impairment
    of Other Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. In
    evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company
    uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. To the
    extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
    attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the
    difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair
    value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a
    committed plan of disposal, whether through sale or abandonment,
    are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less
    costs to sell.

In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various
    factors into account, including changes in merchandising
    strategy, the impact of more experienced retail store managers,
    the impact of increased local advertising and the emphasis on
    retail store cost controls. Since the determination of future
    cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be
    future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not
    meet expectations.

There have been no impairment losses recorded in Fiscal 2007. In
    Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, the Company recognized impairment
    charges on retail fixed assets in the amounts of approximately
    $11 million and $2 million, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“FAS 109”). Under this method, income taxes
    (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes currently
    payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based
    on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include
    the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP and tax
    reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of any
    net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit
    carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences
    between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
    financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under
    enacted tax laws and rates. The financial effect of changes in
    tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment.

Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide
    provision for income taxes. That is, in the ordinary course of a
    global business, there are many transactions for which the
    ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is the Company’s
    policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable
    in future years as a result of an examination by tax
    authorities. The Company establishes those reserves based upon
    management’s assessment of the exposure associated with
    permanent tax differences and tax credits. However, the
    development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments
    about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a
    subjective critical estimate. In addition, valuation allowances
    are established when management determines that it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset
    will not be realized. The net deferred tax assets assume
    sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the
    continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. If the
    Company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be
    realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will


result in a reduction of earnings at that time. Tax reserves and
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — An Interpretation of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a
    two-step process. The Company first will be required to
    determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits of the position. A tax position that meets the
    “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold will then
    be measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in
    the financial statements based upon the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for
    the Company as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008 (April 1,
    2007). While the Company continues to analyze the effect from
    adopting the provisions of FIN 48, it is currently
    anticipated that a cumulative effect adjustment of up to
    $85 million will be charged to retained earnings during the
    first quarter of Fiscal 2008. This estimate is subject to change
    as the Company completes its analysis.

Contingencies

The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in
    the ordinary course of conducting its business, including
    certain litigation, alleged information system security breach
    matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters,
    various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property
    matters. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
    (“FAS 5”), the Company records a liability for
    such contingencies to the extent that it concludes their
    occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In
    addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable
    settlement of a contingency could exceed the established
    liability, the Company discloses the estimated impact on its
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
    Management considers many factors in making these assessments.
    Because the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently
    unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex
    judgments about future events including, but not limited to,
    court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and
    governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss
    contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based
    Payment” (“FAS 123R”), using the modified
    prospective application transition method. Under this transition
    method, the compensation expense recognized in the consolidated
    statement of operations beginning April 2, 2006 includes
    compensation expense for (a) all stock-based payments
    granted prior to, but not yet vested as of April 1, 2006,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation,” as amended by Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure” (“FAS 123”) and (b) all
    stock-based payments granted subsequent to April 1, 2006
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the provisions of FAS 123R.

Prior to April 2, 2006, the Company accounted for
    stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method
    in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” (“APB 25”), and adopted the
    disclosure-only provisions of FAS 123. Under this standard,
    the Company did not recognize compensation expense for the
    issuance of stock options with an exercise price equal to or
    greater than the market price at the date of grant. However, as
    required, the Company disclosed, in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements, the pro forma expense impact
    of the stock option grants as if the fair-value-based
    recognition provisions of FAS 123 were applied.
    Compensation expense was previously recognized for restricted
    stock and restricted stock units. The effect of forfeitures on
    restricted stock and restricted stock units was recognized when
    such forfeitures occurred.


Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which
    requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key
    assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key
    factors influencing the estimation process include the expected
    term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor,
    the expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate, among
    others. Generally, once stock option values are determined,
    current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed,
    even if the estimates used are different from the actuals.

Determining the fair value of stock-based compensation at the
    date of grant requires significant judgment by management,
    including estimates of the above Black-Scholes assumptions. In
    addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of
    stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual
    results differ significantly from these estimates, if management
    changes its assumptions for future stock-based award grants, or
    if there are changes in market conditions, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”) to certain of its senior executives. In
    addition, the Company grants performance-based RSUs to such
    senior executives and other key executives, and certain other
    employees of the Company. The fair values of restricted stock
    shares and RSUs are based on the fair value of unrestricted
    Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of
    dividends for those restricted securities that are not entitled
    to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense for
    performance-based RSUs is recognized over the related service
    period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed
    probable.

Controls
    and Procedures

(

a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other
    procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
    issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time period specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
    Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
    files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is


accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal
    year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation,
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of the fiscal year end covered by
    this annual report.

Management’s Report of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in Securities Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and preparation of financial statements for external
    purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on
    the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this
    evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s
    internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of
    the fiscal year end covered by this annual report.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007 was
    audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,
    which is included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

(

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting

Other than the remediation of the income tax accounting material
    weakness described below, there were no changes during the
    fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 that have materially affected, or
    are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Prior to March 31, 2007, our management had concluded that
    our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to
    the material weakness in our internal control over financial
    reporting with respect to income tax accounting. This control
    deficiency, which management first determined to be a material
    weakness under the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board’s Auditing Standard No. 2 in its Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2005, largely related to
    inadequate internal tax resources for a sufficient period of
    time, lack of formal training for tax personnel and inadequate
    controls and procedures over the tax accounting process to
    complete a comprehensive and timely review of the income tax
    accounts and required tax footnote disclosures. We undertook
    several remedial steps during the period covered by this report
    as well as during the course of Fiscal 2006, as described below,
    to enhance controls. As of the end of the period covered by this
    report, we believe we have taken the necessary steps to
    remediate the material weakness. Before concluding that the
    material weakness was remediated, management implemented and
    evaluated its new controls and procedures for income tax
    accounting and determined that these procedures were operating
    effectively for a sufficient period of time and subjected them
    to appropriate tests in order to conclude that they are
    operating effectively. Accordingly, management has concluded
    that the material weakness in our internal control over
    financial reporting with respect to income tax accounting was
    remediated as of March 31, 2007.

Remediation
    of material weakness

During Fiscal 2006 and 2007, the following remedial steps were
    taken to strengthen internal controls to address the material
    weakness described above:

•

the upgrade and expansion of internal tax staff with appropriate
    qualifications and training in accounting for income taxes;


•

instituting formal training of tax personnel;

•

reviewing income tax accounting processes and implementing
    changes in order to strengthen the design and operation in
    internal controls; and

•

developing and implementing policies to ensure that all
    significant tax accounts are properly reconciled on a timely
    basis and that all tax amounts reflected in our financial
    statements are fairly presented and supported by underlying tax
    calculations.

Management believes the aforementioned steps have resolved the
    material weakness in controls described above for a period of
    time sufficient to conclude that our controls over financial
    reporting are now effective.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Description
    of Business

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (“PRLC”) is a global
    leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium
    lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s and
    children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances and home
    furnishings. PRLC’s long-standing reputation and
    distinctive image have been consistently developed across an
    expanding number of products, brands and international markets.
    PRLC’s brand names include

Polo, Polo by
    Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Black
    Label, RLX, Ralph Lauren Blue Label, Lauren, RRL, Rugby, Chaps,
    Club Monaco

, and

American Living

, among others. PRLC
    and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the
    “Company,” “we,” “us,”
    “our” and “ourselves,” unless the context
    indicates otherwise.

The Company classifies its businesses into three segments:
    Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. The Company’s wholesale
    sales are made principally to major department and specialty
    stores located throughout the U.S. and Europe. The Company also
    sells directly to consumers through full-price and factory
    retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South
    America and Asia, and through its retail internet site located
    at www.Polo.com. In addition, the Company often licenses the
    right to third parties to use its various trademarks in
    connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products,
    such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified
    geographical areas for specified periods.

Basis of
    Presentation

Basis
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
    Company and all entities in which the Company has a controlling
    voting interest. The accompanying consolidated financial
    statements also include the accounts of any variable interest
    entities in which the Company is considered to be the primary
    beneficiary and such entities are required to be consolidated in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. (“US GAAP”). In particular, pursuant to the
    provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46R
    (“FIN 46R”), the Company consolidates Polo Ralph
    Lauren Japan Corporation (“PRL Japan”), a 50%-owned
    venture with Onward Kashiyama Co. Ltd and its subsidiaries
    (“Onward Kashiyama”) and The Seibu Department Stores,
    Ltd (“Seibu”). Prior to the acquisition of the
    minority ownership interests in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC
    (“RL Media”) on March 28, 2007, the Company also
    consolidated RL Media, formerly a 50%-owned venture with NBC
    Universal, Inc. (“NBC”) and Value Vision
    International, Inc. and its related entities (“Value
    Vision”), pursuant to FIN 46R. RL Media conducts the
    Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through an internet site known as Polo.com. See
    Note 5 for further discussion of the Company’s
    acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest of RL Media,
    as well as the Company’s acquisition of the remaining 50%
    ownership interest of PRL Japan in May 2007.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company utilizes a

52-53 week

fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As
    such, Fiscal year 2007 ended on March 31, 2007 and
    reflected a

52-week

period (“Fiscal 2007”); Fiscal year 2006 ended on
    April 1, 2006 and reflected a

52-week

period (“Fiscal 2006”); and Fiscal year 2005 ended on
    April 2, 2005 and reflected a

52-week

period (“Fiscal 2005”).

The financial position and operating results of the
    Company’s consolidated 50% interest in PRL Japan are
    reported on a one-month lag. Similarly, prior to the fourth
    quarter of Fiscal 2006, the financial position and operating
    results of RL Media were reported on a three-month lag. During
    the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, RL Media changed its fiscal
    year, which was formerly on a calendar-year basis, to conform
    with the Company’s fiscal-year basis. In connection with
    this change, the three-month reporting lag for RL Media was
    eliminated. Accordingly, the Company’s operating results
    for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for Fiscal 2007 (the “Fiscal 2007

10-K”)

include the operating results of RL Media for the twelve-month
    periods

ended March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006, respectively,
    whereas Fiscal 2005 includes the operating results of RL Media
    for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2004. The
    net effect from this change in RL Media’s fiscal year was
    not material to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for Fiscal 2006 and was reflected in retained
    earnings as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include reserves
    for customer returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks; reserves for
    the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation and
    other contingencies; impairments of long-lived tangible and
    intangible assets; depreciation and amortization expense;
    accounting for income taxes and related contingencies; the
    valuation of stock-based compensation and related forfeiture
    rates; and accounting for business combinations under the
    purchase method of accounting.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    periods’ financial information in order to conform to the
    current period’s presentation.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when
    there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has
    occurred, price has been fixed or is determinable, and
    collectibility can be reasonably assured.

Revenue within the Company’s Wholesale segment is
    recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of
    estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances, certain cooperative advertising allowances
    and operational chargebacks. Returns and allowances require
    pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade
    terms. Estimates for

end-of-season

markdown allowances are based on historical trends, seasonal
    results, an evaluation of current economic and market
    conditions, and retailer performance. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at
    the time of sale to consumers.

E-commerce

revenue from sales of products ordered through the
    Company’s retail internet site known as Polo.com is
    recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its
    customers. Such revenue also is reduced by an estimate of
    returns.

Revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized when earned in
    accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements,
    generally based upon the higher of (a) contractually
    guaranteed minimum royalty levels and (b) estimates of
    sales and royalty data received from the Company’s
    licensees.

Sales
    Taxes

In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    reached a consensus on EITF Issue

No. 06-03,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)”
    (“EITF

06-03”).

EITF

06-03

provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a
    governmental authority that are directly imposed on
    revenue-related transactions between sellers and customers on
    either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision
    that should be disclosed. The

F-7

    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company accounts for sales and other related taxes on a net
    basis, excluding such taxes from revenue and cost of revenue.

Cost
    of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and
    produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in,
    and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage
    and inventory obsolescence. The costs of selling merchandise,
    including preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking,
    packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in selling,
    general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

The costs associated with shipping goods to customers are
    reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and
    handling costs incurred approximated $92 million in Fiscal
    2007, $77 million in Fiscal 2006 and $56 million in
    Fiscal 2005. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers
    are included in revenues.

Advertising
    Costs

In accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 93-7,

“Reporting on Advertising Costs,” advertising costs,
    including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when
    the advertisement is first exhibited. In accordance with EITF
    Issue

No. 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,”
    costs of

out-of-store

advertising paid to wholesale customers under cooperative
    advertising programs are expensed as an advertising cost if both
    the identified advertising benefit is sufficiently separable
    from the purchase of the Company’s products by customers
    and the fair value of such benefit is measurable. Otherwise,
    such costs are reflected as a reduction of revenue. Costs of
    in-store advertising paid to wholesale customers under
    cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising
    costs, but are reflected as a reduction of revenues since the
    benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of
    the Company’s products by customers.

Advertising expense amounted to approximately $181 million
    for Fiscal 2007, $166 million for Fiscal 2006 and
    $127 million for Fiscal 2005. Deferred advertising costs,
    which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet
    been exhibited or services that have not yet been received, were
    approximately $3 million and $4 million at the end of
    Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and operating results of foreign
    operations are primarily consolidated using the local currency
    as the functional currency. Local currency assets and
    liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the
    balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are
    translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
    Resulting translation gains or losses are included in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity
    as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    Gains and losses on translation of intercompany loans with
    foreign subsidiaries of a long-term investment nature also are
    included within this component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company also recognizes gains and losses on transactions
    that are denominated in a currency other than the respective
    entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses also include amounts realized on the settlement
    of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are either
    short-term, or were previously of a long-term, investment nature
    and deferred as a component of stockholders’ equity.
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in
    earnings and separately disclosed in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders’
    equity, consists of net income (loss) and other gains and losses
    affecting equity that, under US GAAP, are excluded from net
    income (loss). The components of other comprehensive income
    (loss) for the Company primarily consist of foreign currency
    translation gains and losses and deferred gains and losses on
    hedging instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts
    designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of
    the Company’s Euro-denominated debt designated as a hedge
    of changes in the fair value of the Company’s net
    investment in certain of its European subsidiaries.

Net
    Income Per Common Share

Net income per common share is determined in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
    “Earnings per Share” (“FAS 128”). Under
    the provisions of FAS 128, basic net income per common
    share is computed by dividing the net income applicable to
    common shares after preferred dividend requirements, if any, by
    the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the
    period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the
    Company’s Class A and Class B common stock.
    Diluted net income per common share adjusts basic net income per
    common share for the effects of outstanding stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other
    potentially dilutive financial instruments, only in the periods
    in which such effect is dilutive under the treasury stock method.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to
    calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to
    those shares used in calculating diluted net income per common
    share as follows:

Options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
    greater than the average market price of the common stock are
    anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of
    diluted net income per common share. In addition, the Company
    has outstanding performance-based restricted stock units that
    are issuable only upon the satisfaction of certain performance
    goals. Such units only are included in the computation of
    diluted shares to the extent the underlying performance
    conditions (a) are satisfied prior to the end of the
    reporting period or (b) would be satisfied if the end of
    the reporting period were the end of the related contingency
    period and the result would be dilutive. As of the end of Fiscal
    2007 and Fiscal 2006, there was an aggregate of approximately
    1.0 million and 0.8 million, respectively, of
    additional shares issuable upon the exercise of anti-dilutive
    options

and/or

the
    contingent vesting of performance-based restricted stock units
    that were excluded from the diluted share calculations.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based
    Payment” (“FAS 123R”). This statement
    requires all share-based payments to employees to be expensed
    based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the
    requisite service period. The Company applied the requirements
    of FAS 123R using the modified prospective method and,
    therefore, prior periods were not restated. Under the modified
    prospective method, the Company records compensation expense for
    (1) the unvested portion of previously issued awards that
    remained outstanding at the initial date of adoption and
    (2) for any awards issued,

F-9

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

modified or settled after the effective date of the statement.
    The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation method to determine
    the grant date fair value of its stock option awards.

Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company’s
    stock-based compensation was recognized using the intrinsic
    value method, which measures stock-based compensation expense as
    the amount at which the market price of the stock at the date of
    grant exceeds the exercise price. Accordingly, no compensation
    expense was recognized for the Company’s stock option
    awards. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the
    Company’s stock-based compensation expense consisted of
    restricted stock and service-based restricted stock unit and
    performance-based restricted stock unit awards, which were
    accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”).

See Note 18 for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation and the adoption of FAS 123R.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less, including
    investments in debt securities. Investments in debt securities
    are diversified among high-credit quality securities in
    accordance with the Company’s risk-management policies, and
    primarily include commercial paper and money market funds.

Restricted
    Cash

The Company has placed €58.9 million
    ($77.2 million) of cash in escrow with certain banks,
    primarily in Fiscal 2007, as collateral to secure guarantees of
    a corresponding amount made by the banks to certain
    international tax authorities on behalf of the Company. Of the
    €58.9 million of cash in escrow,
    €41.3 million ($55.1 million) was placed as
    collateral to secure guarantees made to the French tax
    authorities for the payment of an asserted excess royalties tax
    matter and €17.6 million ($22.1 million) was
    placed as collateral to secure refunds of value-added tax
    payments in certain international tax jurisdictions. Such cash
    has been classified as restricted cash and reported as a
    component of other assets in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet. See Note 15 for further discussion of the
    French tax matter.

Accounts
    Receivable

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to
    customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts
    receivable, net, as shown in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet, is net of certain reserves and allowances. These
    reserves and allowances consist of (a) reserves for
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks and
    (b) allowances for doubtful accounts. These reserves and
    allowances are discussed in further detail below.

A reserve for trade discounts is determined based on open
    invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers,
    and is treated as a reduction of revenue.

Estimated

end-of-season

markdown allowances are included as a reduction of revenue.
    These provisions are based on retail sales performance, seasonal
    negotiations with customers, historical deduction trends and an
    evaluation of current market conditions.

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
    deductions by customers relating to individual shipments. This
    reserve, net of expected recoveries, is included as a reduction
    of revenue. The reserve is based on chargebacks received as of
    the date of the financial statements and past experience. Costs
    associated with potential returns of products also are included
    as a reduction of revenues. These return reserves are based on
    current information regarding retail performance, historical
    experience and an evaluation of current market conditions. The
    Company’s historical estimates of these operational
    chargeback and return costs have not differed materially from
    actual results.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

In the wholesale business, the Company has two key
    department-store customers that generate significant sales
    volume. For Fiscal 2007, these two customers contributed
    approximately 29% and 14% of all wholesale revenues and 43% in
    the aggregate.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories, assessing slow-turning, ongoing (specially made for
    Retail) product, as well as all fashion product. Estimated
    realizable value of distressed inventory is determined based on
    historical sales trends of the Company’s individual product
    lines for this category of inventory, the impact of market
    trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders
    in-house relating to the future sales of this category of
    inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to
    quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and
    retailer preferences and market conditions. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not
    differed materially from actual results.

Investments

Investments in companies in which the Company has significant
    influence, but less than a controlling voting interest, are
    accounted for using the equity method. This is generally
    presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of
    the investee. However, as a matter of policy, if the Company had
    a greater than 50% ownership interest in an investee and the
    minority shareholders held certain rights that allowed them to
    participate in the

day-to-day

operations of the business, the Company would also use the
    equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, only the Company’s investment in
    and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in
    the consolidated balance sheets; only the Company’s share
    of the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in the
    consolidated operating results; and only the dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the investee
    and additional cash investments, loan repayments or other cash
    paid to the investee are included in the consolidated cash flows.

Investments in companies in which the Company does not have a
    controlling interest, or is unable to exert significant
    influence, are accounted for at market value if the investments
    are publicly traded and there are no resale restrictions greater
    than one year

(“available-for-sale

investments”). If resale restrictions greater than one year
    exist, or if the investment is not publicly traded, the
    investment is accounted for at cost.

As of March 31, 2007, the Company’s only significant
    investment is an approximate 20% equity interest in Impact 21
    Co., Ltd. (“Impact 21”). Impact 21 is a public company
    that holds the sublicenses for the Company’s men’s,
    women’s and jeans businesses in Japan. The Company accounts
    for its interest in Impact 21, which is included in other
    assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, using
    the equity method of accounting. See Note 5 for further
    discussion of the Company’s Japanese Business Acquisitions
    that occurred in May 2007.

In addition, see Note 5 for a discussion of the
    Company’s formation of a joint venture in April 2007 to
    conduct its watch and jewelry business, which will be accounted
    for under the equity method of accounting.

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture,
    fixtures, computer systems and equipment; from three to ten
    years for machinery and equipment; and from ten to forty years
    for buildings and building improvements. Leasehold improvements
    are depreciated over periods equal to the shorter of the
    estimated useful lives of the respective assets and the life of
    the lease.

Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are
    evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
    (“FAS 144”). In evaluating long-lived assets for
    recoverability, including finite-lived intangibles as described
    below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual
    disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted
    net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the
    carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
    equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset
    and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there
    is a committed plan of disposal, whether through sale or
    abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair
    value less costs to sell.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”). At
    acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of
    purchased intangible assets, which primarily consists of license

F-12

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and
    order backlog. The fair value of these intangible assets is
    estimated based on management’s assessment, as well as
    independent third party appraisals, when necessary. The excess
    of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets
    acquired is recorded as goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill,
    including any goodwill included in the carrying value of
    investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting,
    and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment
    at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair
    values to their carrying values. Finite-lived intangible assets
    are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and,
    along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated
    for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may
    not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. See
    discussion of the Company’s accounting policy for
    impairment as described earlier under the caption
    “

Property and Equipment, Net.

”

Officers’
    Life Insurance

The Company maintains several whole-life and a few split-dollar
    life insurance policies for certain of its senior executives.
    Whole-life policies are recorded at their cash-surrender value,
    and split-dollar policies are recorded at the lesser of their
    cash-surrender value or aggregate premiums

paid-to-date

in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of the end
    of Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, amounts of $53 million and
    $52 million, respectively, relating to officers’ life
    insurance policies held by the Company were classified within
    other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“FAS 109”). Under this method, income taxes
    (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes currently
    payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based
    on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include
    the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax reporting.
    Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net
    operating loss, capital loss and general business credit
    carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences
    between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
    financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under
    enacted tax laws and rates. The financial effect of changes in
    tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment.

Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide
    provision for income taxes. That is, in the ordinary course of a
    global business, there are many transactions for which the
    ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is the Company’s
    policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable
    in future years as a result of an examination by tax
    authorities. The Company establishes those reserves based upon
    management’s assessment of the exposure associated with
    permanent tax differences and tax credits. In addition,
    valuation allowances are established when management determines
    that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax reserves and
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

In addition, see Note 4 for the Company’s discussion
    of the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment, including
    its retail stores. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for
    under the provisions of FAS No. 13, “Accounting
    for Leases” and other related authoritative accounting
    literature (“FAS 13”). Certain of the
    Company’s leases contain renewal options, rent escalation
    clauses

and/or

landlord incentives. Rent expense for noncancelable operating
    leases with scheduled rent increases

and/or

landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement
    date. The excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled
    payment amounts and landlord

F-13

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

incentives is recorded as a deferred rent liability. As of the
    end of Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, unamortized deferred rent
    obligations of approximately $96 million and
    $85 million, respectively, were classified within other
    non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets.

For leases in which the Company is involved with the
    construction of the building (generally on land owned by the
    landlord), the Company accounts for the lease during the
    construction period under the provisions of EITF

No. 97-10,

“The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset
    Construction”

(“EITF 97-10”).

If the Company concludes that it has substantively all of the
    risks of ownership during construction of a leased property and,
    therefore, is deemed the owner of the project for accounting
    purposes, it records an asset and related financing obligation
    for the amount of total project costs related to

construction-in-progress

and the pre-existing building. Once construction is complete,
    the Company considers the requirements under
    FAS No. 98, “Accounting for Leases:
    Sale-Leaseback Transactions Involving Real Estate, Sales-Type
    Leases of Real Estate, Definition of Lease Term, and Initial
    Direct Costs of Direct Financing Leases,” for
    sale-leaseback treatment. If the arrangement does not qualify
    for sale-leaseback treatment, the Company continues to amortize
    the financing obligation and depreciate the building over the
    lease term.

Derivatives
    and Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” and subsequent amendments (collectively,
    “FAS 133”). FAS 133 requires that all
    derivative instruments be recognized on the balance sheet at
    fair value. In addition, FAS 133 provides that, for
    derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, the
    effective portion of changes in the fair value are either
    (a) offset against the changes in fair value of the hedged
    assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or
    (b) recognized in stockholders’ equity until the
    hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the
    derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash
    flows, respectively. For each derivative instrument entered into
    where the Company seeks to obtain hedge accounting treatment,
    the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
    item, as well as the related risk management objective and how
    the effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be
    assessed, is formally documented. The ineffective portion of a
    derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized
    in earnings.

For cash flow reporting purposes, the Company classifies
    proceeds received or paid upon the settlement of a derivative
    financial instrument in the same manner as the item being hedged.

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments
    approximates fair value, except for certain differences relating
    to fixed-rate debt, investments in other entities accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting and other financial
    instruments. However, other than differences in the fair value
    of fixed-rate debt as disclosed in Note 13, these
    differences were not significant as of March 31, 2007 and
    April 1, 2006. The fair value of financial instruments
    generally is determined by reference to market values resulting
    from the trading of the instruments on a national securities
    exchange or an

over-the-counter

market. In cases where quoted market prices are not available,
    fair value is based on estimates derived through the use of
    present value or other valuation techniques.

Financial
    Statement Misstatements

In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 was issued in order to
    eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public
    companies quantify and evaluate financial statement
    misstatements.

Traditionally, there have been two widely-recognized methods for
    quantifying and evaluating the effects of financial statement
    misstatements: (i) the balance sheet (“iron
    curtain”) method and (ii) the income statement

F-14

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(“rollover”) method. The iron curtain method
    quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the
    misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the
    reporting period. The rollover method quantifies a misstatement
    based on the amount of the error originating in the current
    period income statement, including the reversing effect of prior
    year misstatements. The use of the rollover method can lead to
    the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet. Prior to
    the adoption of SAB 108, the Company historically used the
    rollover method for quantifying and evaluating identified
    financial statement misstatements.

By issuing SAB 108, the SEC staff established an approach
    that requires quantification and evaluation of financial
    statement misstatements based on the effects of the
    misstatements under both the iron curtain and rollover methods.
    This model is commonly referred to as a “dual
    approach.”

SAB 108 requires companies to initially apply its
    provisions either by (i) restating prior financial
    statements as if the “dual approach” had always been
    applied or (ii) recording the cumulative effect of
    initially applying the “dual approach” as adjustments
    to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the
    beginning of the current fiscal year, with an offsetting
    adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.
    The Company elected to record the effects of applying
    SAB 108 using the cumulative effect transition method and,
    as such, recorded a $16.9 million reduction in retained
    earnings as of April 2, 2006. The following table
    summarizes the effects of applying SAB 108 for each period
    in which the identified misstatement originated through
    April 2, 2006:

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — An Interpretation of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a
    two-step process. The Company first will be required to
    determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits of the position. A tax position that meets the
    “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold will then
    be measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in
    the financial statements based upon the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for
    the Company as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008 (April 1,
    2007). While the Company continues to analyze the effect from
    adopting the provisions of FIN 48, it is currently
    anticipated that a cumulative effect adjustment of up to
    $85 million will be charged to retained earnings during the
    first quarter of Fiscal 2008. This estimate is subject to change
    as the Company completes its analysis.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R and, in March
    2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
    (“SAB 107”). SAB 107 provides implementation
    guidance for companies to use in their adoption of
    FAS 123R. FAS 123R supersedes both APB 25, which
    permitted the use of the intrinsic-value method in accounting
    for stock-based compensation, and Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure” (“FAS 123”), which allowed
    companies applying APB 25 to just disclose in their
    financial statements the pro forma effect on net income from
    applying the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based
    compensation. The Company adopted FAS 123R as of
    April 2, 2006. See Note 18 for further discussion of
    the Company’s stock-based compensation and the adoption of
    FAS 123R.

Other
    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities —
    Including an Amendment of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 115” (“FAS 159”).
    FAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure, on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, financial instruments and certain other items at fair
    value that are not currently required to be measured at fair
    value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
    value option is elected will be recognized in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for the
    Company as of the beginning of Fiscal 2009 (March 30,
    2008). The application of FAS 159 is not expected to have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R”
    (“FAS 158”). FAS 158 requires an employer
    that is a business entity and sponsors one or more
    single-employer defined benefit plans to recognize the funded
    status of a benefit plan — measured as the difference
    between plan assets at fair value (with limited exceptions) and
    the benefit obligation — in its statement of financial
    position. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the
    projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement
    benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit
    obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    FAS 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2006. Because the Company does not currently
    maintain any significant defined benefit plans, the application
    of FAS 158 did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions

Fiscal
    2008 Transactions

Japanese
    Business Acquisitions

On May 29, 2007, the Company completed its previously
    announced transactions to acquire control of certain of its
    Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed
    arrangements. In particular, the Company acquired approximately
    77% of the outstanding shares of Impact 21 that it did not
    previously own in a cash tender offer (the “Impact 21
    Acquisition”), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact
    21 from approximately 20% to 97%. Impact 21 conducts the
    Company’s men’s, women’s and jeans apparel and
    accessories business in Japan under a

sub-license

arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in PRL Japan, which holds the master license to conduct
    Polo’s business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu
    (the “PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition”).
    Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan
    Minority Interest Acquisition are hereafter referred to as the
    “Japanese Business Acquisitions.”

The purchase price initially paid in connection with the Impact
    21 Acquisition was approximately $327 million. However, the
    Company intends to acquire, over the next several months, the
    remaining approximately 3% of the outstanding shares not
    exchanged as of the close of the tender offer period at an
    estimated aggregate cost of approximately $12 million. In
    addition, the purchase price paid in connection with the PRL
    Japan Minority Interest Acquisition was approximately
    $22 million.

The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with
    available cash on-hand and approximately $170 million of
    Yen-based borrowings under a one-year term loan agreement on
    terms substantially similar to the Company’s existing
    credit facility. The Company expects to repay the borrowing by
    its maturity date using a portion of the approximate
    $200 million of Impact 21’s cash on-hand acquired as
    part of the acquisition.

The results of operations for Impact 21 will be consolidated
    effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008. The results of
    operations for PRL Japan already are consolidated by the Company
    as described further in Note 2 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements.

The Company is in the process of preparing its assessment of the
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the
    allocation of the purchase price. The Company also has entered
    into a transition services agreement with Onward Kashiyama
    which, along with its affiliates, was a former approximate 41%
    shareholder of Impact 21, to provide a variety of
    operational, human resources and information systems-related
    services over a period of up to two years.

    Company (“Kellwood”) substantially all of the assets
    of New Campaign, Inc., the Company’s licensee for
    men’s and women’s belts and other small leather goods
    under the Ralph Lauren, Lauren and Chaps brands in the
    U.S. The assets acquired from Kellwood will be operated
    under the name of “Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods” and
    will allow the Company to further expand its accessories
    business. The acquisition cost was approximately
    $10 million and is subject to customary closing
    adjustments. Kellwood will provide various transition services
    for up to six months after the closing.

The results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods
    business will be consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing in Fiscal 2008. The Company is in the
    process of preparing its assessment of the fair value of assets
    acquired.

Formation
    of Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Joint Venture

On March 5, 2007, the Company announced that it had agreed
    to form a joint venture with Financiere Richemont SA
    (“Richemont”), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group. The

50-50

joint
    venture will be a Swiss corporation named the Ralph Lauren Watch
    and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the “RL Watch
    Company”), whose purpose is to design, develop,
    manufacture, sell and distribute luxury watches and fine jewelry
    through Ralph Lauren boutiques, as well as through fine
    independent jewelry and luxury watch retailers throughout the
    world. The Company expects to account for its 50% interest in
    the RL Watch Company under the equity method of accounting.
    Royalty payments due to the Company under the related license
    agreement for use of certain of the Company’s trademarks
    will be reflected as licensing revenue within the consolidated
    statement of operations. The RL Watch Company is expected to
    commence operations during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008 and
    it is expected that the products will be launched in the fall of
    calendar 2008.

Fiscal
    2007 Transactions

Acquisition
    of RL Media Minority Interest

On March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    equity interest in RL Media formerly held by NBC (37.5%) and
    Value Vision (12.5%). RL Media conducts the Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through the Polo.com internet site and is
    consolidated by the Company as the primary beneficiary pursuant
    to the provisions of FIN 46R. The acquisition cost was
    $175 million. In addition, Value Vision entered into a
    transition services agreement with the Company to provide order
    fulfillment and related services over a period of up to
    seventeen months from the date of the acquisition of the RL
    Media minority interest.

The Company evaluated the terms of all significant pre-existing
    relationships between itself and RL Media to determine if a
    settlement of the pre-existing relationships existed. In
    addition, the Company obtained valuation analyses of RL Media
    prepared by an independent valuation firm. Based on these
    analyses, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties
    under the RL Media partnership agreement, the Company determined
    that all of the consideration exchanged should be allocated to
    the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest. Accordingly,
    no settlement gain or loss was recognized in connection with
    this transaction.

The excess of the acquisition cost over the pre-existing
    minority interest liability of $33 million has been
    allocated on a preliminary basis as follows: inventory of
    $8 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
    $55 million (consisting of the re-acquired license of
    $50 million and customer list of $5 million); and
    goodwill of $79 million. The Company is in the process of
    completing its assessment of the fair value of assets acquired.
    As a result, the estimated purchase price allocation is subject
    to change.

Fiscal
    2006 Transactions

Acquisition
    of Polo Jeans Business

On February 3, 2006, the Company acquired from Jones
    Apparel Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Jones”) all
    of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun
    Apparel, Inc., the Company’s licensee for men’s and
    women’s casual apparel and sportswear in the U.S. and
    Canada (the “Polo Jeans Business”). The acquisition
    cost was approximately $260 million, including transaction
    costs. In addition, simultaneous with the transaction, the
    Company settled all claims under its litigation with Jones for a
    cost of $100 million.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. However,
    because the Company simultaneously purchased a business and
    settled all pre-existing litigation, the aggregate consideration
    exchanged was required to be allocated for accounting purposes
    in proportion to the underlying fair values of the legal
    settlement and the Polo Jeans Business acquired. Based on the
    arm’s-length negotiation with Jones, the Company determined
    that the fair value of the legal settlement was
    $100 million, which equaled the amount of a litigation
    reserve initially established by the Company during Fiscal 2005.
    The remaining $255 million of consideration exchanged was
    allocated to the Polo Jeans Business based on valuation analyses
    prepared by an independent valuation firm.

The results of operations for the Polo Jeans Business have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing February 4, 2006. In addition, the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the following
    allocation of the acquisition cost to the net assets acquired
    based on their respective fair values: inventory of
    $36 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
    $159 million (consisting of the re-acquired license of
    $97 million, customer relationships of $57 million and
    order backlog of $5 million); goodwill of
    $126 million; and deferred tax and other liabilities, net,
    of $61 million. Other than inventory, Jones retained the
    right to all working capital balances on the date of closing.

The Company also entered into a transition services agreement
    with Jones to provide a variety of operational, financial and
    information systems services over a period of six to twelve
    months from the date of the acquisition of the Polo Jeans
    Business.

Acquisition
    of Footwear Business

On July 15, 2005, the Company acquired from Reebok
    International, Ltd. (“Reebok”) all of the issued and
    outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear
    Co., Inc., the Company’s global licensee for men’s,
    women’s and children’s footwear, as well as certain
    foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok (collectively, the
    “Footwear Business”). The acquisition cost was
    approximately $112 million in cash, including
    $2 million of transaction costs. In addition, Reebok and
    certain of its affiliates entered into a transition services
    agreement with the Company to provide a variety of operational,
    financial and information systems services over a period of
    twelve to eighteen months from the date of the acquisition of
    the Footwear Business.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. As such, based
    on valuation analyses prepared by an independent valuation firm,
    the Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    purchase of the Footwear Business and no settlement gain or loss
    was recognized in connection with the transaction.

The results of operations for the Footwear Business for the
    period have been consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing July 16, 2005. In addition, the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    following allocation of the acquisition cost to the net assets
    acquired based on their respective fair values: trade
    receivables of $17 million; inventory of $26 million;
    finite-lived intangible assets of $62 million (consisting
    of the footwear license at $38 million, customer

    the Company’s licensee holding the exclusive licenses to
    design, manufacture, merchandise and sell newborn, infant,
    toddler, girls and boys clothing in the U.S., Canada and Mexico
    (the “Childrenswear Business”). The purchase price was
    approximately $264 million, including transaction costs,
    deferred payments of $15 million payable over the three
    years after the acquisition date and $5 million of
    contingent payments. The contingent payments were conditional on
    certain sales targets being attained and, during Fiscal 2005,
    the Company recognized the obligation with a corresponding
    increase in goodwill because it became probable that the sales
    targets would be attained. As of the end of Fiscal 2007,
    $17 million of the deferred and conditional payments were
    made and the remaining portion of approximately $3 million
    of deferred and conditional payments were classified as a
    component of other current liabilities in the accompanying

As discussed in Note 3, the Company periodically evaluates
    the recoverability of the carrying value of fixed assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    assets’ values may be impaired. No impairment charges were
    recognized in Fiscal 2007. During Fiscal 2006, the Company
    recorded impairment charges of approximately $10.8 million
    to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets, largely related to
    its Club Monaco retail business that includes its Caban Concept
    and Club Monaco factory stores. This impairment charge primarily
    related to

lower-than-expected

store performance and preceded the Company’s implementation
    of a plan to restructure these operations in February 2006. In
    measuring the amount of the impairment, fair value was

The Company recorded a similar $1.5 million retail store

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 3, the Company accounts for goodwill
    and other intangible assets in accordance with FAS 142.
    Under FAS 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets
    deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized.
    Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are
    subject to annual impairment testing. Finite-lived intangible
    assets continue to be amortized over their respective estimated
    useful lives. Based on the Company’s annual impairment
    testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in
    Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, no impairment charges
    were deemed necessary.

Restructuring

The Company has recorded restructuring liabilities over the past
    few years relating to various cost-savings initiatives, as well
    as certain of its acquisitions. In accordance with US GAAP,
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition
    are capitalized as part of the purchase accounting for the
    transaction. Such acquisition-related restructuring costs were
    not material in any period. Liabilities for costs associated
    with non-acquisition-related restructuring initiatives are
    expensed and initially measured at fair value when incurred in
    accordance with US GAAP. A description of the nature of
    significant non-acquisition-related restructuring activities and
    related costs is presented below.

Fiscal
    2007 Restructuring

In connection with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan described
    below, during Fiscal 2007 the Company ultimately decided to
    close all of Club Monaco’s Caban Concept Stores (the
    “Caban Stores”) and recognized $4.0 million of
    associated restructuring charges, primarily relating to lease
    termination costs.

Additionally, the Company recognized $0.6 million of other
    restructuring charges primarily related to severance costs
    associated with the transition of certain sourcing and
    production functions from Columbia to the U.S. during
    Fiscal 2007.

Fiscal
    2006 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company committed
    to a plan to restructure its Club Monaco retail business. In
    particular, this plan consisted of the closure of all five Club
    Monaco factory stores and the intention to dispose of by sale or
    closure all eight of the Caban Stores (collectively, the
    “Club Monaco Restructuring Plan”). In connection with
    this plan, an aggregate restructuring-related charge of
    $12 million was recognized in Fiscal 2006. This charge
    consisted of (a) a $3 million writedown of inventory
    to estimated net realizable value, which has been classified as
    a component of cost of goods sold in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations, (b) a
    $5 million writedown of fixed and other net assets, which
    has been classified as a component of restructuring charges in
    the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and
    (c) the recognition of a $4 million liability relating
    to lease termination costs, which has been classified as a
    component of restructuring charges in the accompanying

The Company has available federal, state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards of $1.3 million,
    $4.9 million and $9.3 million, respectively, for tax
    purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss
    carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal 2008. The utilization
    of the federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to
    the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which
    applies following certain changes in ownership of the entity
    generating the loss carryforward.

Also, the Company has available state and foreign net operating
    loss carryforwards of $6.9 million and $4.1 million,
    respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been
    recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded since
    management does not believe that the Company will more likely
    than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future
    taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax
    assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such
    recognition.

The valuation allowance decreased to $1.6 million in Fiscal
    2007 from $9.5 million in Fiscal 2006. This decrease is
    primarily due to the utilization of foreign net operating losses
    for which a valuation allowance was previously recorded.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign
    taxes on $274.5 million of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings have been and will continue
    to be reinvested. These earnings could become subject to tax if
    they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were lent
    to PRLC, a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of PRLC, or if
    the stock of the subsidiaries were sold. Determination of the
    amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to
    such earnings is not practical. Management believes that the
    amount of the

F-26

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

additional taxes that might be payable on the earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries, if remitted, would be partially offset by
    U.S. foreign tax credits.

The Company is periodically examined by various federal, state
    and foreign tax jurisdictions. The tax years under examination
    vary by jurisdiction. The Company regularly considers the
    likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions
    and has established tax allowances which represent
    management’s best estimate of the potential assessments.
    The resolution of tax matters could differ from the amount
    reserved. While that difference could be material to the result
    of operations and cash flows for any affected reporting period,
    it is not expected to have a material impact on consolidated
    financial position or consolidated liquidity.

The Company will adopt FIN 48 as of the beginning of Fiscal
    2008 (April 1, 2007). While the Company continues to
    analyze the effect from adopting the provisions of FIN 48,
    it is currently anticipated that a cumulative effect adjustment
    of up to $85 million will be charged to retained earnings
    during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008. This estimate is
    subject to change as the Company completes its analysis. See
    Note 4 for the Company’s discussion of recently issued
    accounting standards, including accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes.

The Company had outstanding approximately €227 million

    €275 million in 1999 (the “1999 Euro Debt”).
    On October 5, 2006, the Company completed a new issuance of
    €300 million principal amount of 4.50% notes due
    October 4, 2013 (the “2006 Euro Debt”). The
    Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the financing of
    approximately $380 million (based on the exchange rate in
    effect upon issuance) to repay the remaining 1999 Euro Debt at
    par on its maturity date. The balance of such net proceeds was
    used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The
    Company has the option to redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at
    any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount
    plus a premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of
    the 2006 Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest, in
    the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax law.
    Partial redemption of the 2006 Euro Debt is not permitted in
    either instance. In the event of a change of control of the
    Company, each holder of the 2006 Euro Debt has the option to
    require the Company to redeem the 2006 Euro Debt at its
    principal amount plus accrued interest.

Revolving
    Credit Facility and Term Loan

The Company has a credit facility, which was amended on
    November 28, 2006, that provides for a $450 million
    unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Credit
    Facility”). The Credit Facility also is used to support the
    issuance of letters of credit. As of March 31, 2007, there
    were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, but
    the

F-27

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company was contingently liable for $25.7 million of
    outstanding letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory
    purchase commitments).

The Company amended certain terms of its Credit Facility as a
    result of recent upgrades in its credit ratings from
    Standard & Poors and Moody’s. Key changes under
    the amendment include:

•

An increase in the ability of the Company to expand its
    additional borrowing availability from $525 million to
    $600 million, subject to the agreement of one or more new
    or existing lenders under the facility to increase their
    commitments;

•

An extension of the term of the Credit Facility to November 2011
    from October 2009;

•

A reduction in the margin over LIBOR paid by the Company on
    amounts drawn under the Credit Facility to 35 basis points
    from 50 basis points;

•

A reduction in the commitment fee for the unutilized portion of
    the Credit Facility to 8 basis points from 12.5 basis
    points; and

•

The elimination of the coverage ratio financial covenant.

There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability
    throughout the term of the Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
    Company’s option, either at (a) a base rate determined
    by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial
    lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time
    to time and (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal
    funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in
    effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve
    Board’s Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve
    percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility
    (“the applicable margin”). The applicable margin of
    35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the
    Company’s credit ratings.

The Credit Facility was amended as of May 22, 2007 to
    provide for the addition of a loan in a Japanese yen amount
    equal to approximately $170 million (the “Term
    Loan”). The Term Loan was made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and is guaranteed by the
    Company, as well as the other subsidiaries of the Company which
    currently guarantee the Credit Facility. The proceeds of the
    Term Loan have been used to finance the Tender Offer and the
    total related acquisition cost and the acquisition by the
    Company of the remaining 50% of the shares of PRL Japan the
    Company did not previously own. Borrowings under the Term Loan
    bear interest at a LIBOR rate for yen loans for an interest
    period of 12 months plus the applicable margin. The
    maturity date of the Term Loan is on the

12-month

anniversary of the drawing date of the Term Loan. The Company
    expects to repay the borrowing by its maturity date using a
    portion of Impact 21’s cash on-hand of approximately
    $200 million acquired as part of the acquisition. See
    Note 5 for further discussion of the Japanese Business
    Acquisitions.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility
    also is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit
    ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the
    Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to
    Consolidated EBITDAR (the “leverage ratio”), as such
    terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of March 31,
    2007, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to
    the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company’s
    Credit Facility.

F-28

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenant described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of
    Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities fail
    to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power
    of the Company’s common stock.

Fair
    Value of Debt

Based on the prevailing level of market interest rates as of
    March 31, 2007, the carrying value of the Company’s
    2006 Euro Debt exceeded its fair value by approximately
    $4 million. As of April 1, 2006, the fair value of the
    Company’s 1999 Euro Debt approximated its carrying value.
    Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not result in the
    realization or expenditure of cash, unless the debt is retired
    prior to its maturity.

14.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows generated by
    its international operations and possible declines in the fair
    value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign
    operations, as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of
    its fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, the Company periodically uses derivative financial
    instruments to manage such risks. The Company does not enter
    into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The
    following is a summary of the Company’s risk management
    strategies and the effect of those strategies on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as
    hedges, primarily relating to identifiable currency positions to
    reduce its risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory
    purchases and intercompany royalty payments made by certain of
    its international operations. As part of its overall strategy to
    manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily exposure to changes in the
    value of the Euro and the Japanese Yen, the Company hedges a
    portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the
    ensuing twelve-month to two-year periods. In doing so, the
    Company uses foreign exchange contracts that generally have
    maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing
    coverage throughout the hedging period.

As of March 31, 2007, the Company had contracts for the
    sale of $214 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates.
    Of these $214 million of sales contracts, $180 million
    were for the sale of Euros and $34 million were for the
    sale of Japanese Yen. The total fair value of the forward
    contracts was an unrealized loss of $1.9 million. As of
    April 1, 2006, the Company had contracts for the sale of
    $90 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these
    $90 million of sales contracts, $22 million were for
    the sale of Euros and $68 million were for the sale of
    Japanese Yen. The total fair value of the forward contracts
    was an unrealized loss of $1.8 million.

The Company records foreign currency exchange contracts at fair
    value in its balance sheet and designates these derivative
    instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with FAS 133.
    As such, the related gains or losses on these contracts are
    deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains and
    losses are then either recognized in income in the period in
    which the related royalties being hedged are received, or in the
    case of inventory purchases, recognized as part of the cost of
    the inventory being hedged when sold. However, to the extent
    that any of these foreign currency exchange contracts are not
    considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in
    the value of the royalties or inventory purchases being hedged,
    any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of
    these contracts are immediately recognized in earnings. No
    significant gains or losses relating to ineffective hedges were
    recognized in the periods presented.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company had deferred net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in the amount of approximately $2 million at the
    end of Fiscal 2007, all of which is expected to be recognized in
    earnings in Fiscal 2008. Net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in the amount of approximately $1 million were
    deferred at the end of Fiscal 2006. The Company recognized net
    gains on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of
    approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2007 and
    $5 million for Fiscal 2006.

Subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into
    foreign currency option contracts with a notional value of
    $159 million for the right, but not the obligation, to
    purchase foreign currencies at fixed rates. These contracts
    hedged the majority of the foreign currency exposure related to
    the financing of the Japanese Business Acquisitions, but do not
    qualify under FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. The
    Company will recognize a gain or loss, limited to the premium
    paid for the option contracts, upon the settlement of the
    contracts during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

Prior to the Company’s repayment of the 1999 Euro Debt in
    November 2006, the entire principal amount was designated as a
    hedge of the Company’s net investment in certain of its
    European subsidiaries in accordance with FAS 133.
    Contemporaneous with this repayment, the Company designated the
    entire principal amount of the 2006 Euro Debt, issued in October
    2006 (see Note 13 for further discussion), as a hedge of
    its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. As
    required by FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a
    derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial instrument
    (such as debt) that is designated as, and is effective as, a
    hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in
    the same manner as a translation adjustment under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, “Foreign
    Currency Translation,” to the extent it is effective as a
    hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the 1999 Euro Debt
    and the 2006 Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro
    exchange rate have been, and continue to be, reported in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. The Company recorded aggregate gains
    (losses) net of tax in stockholders’ equity on the
    translation of the 1999 Euro Debt and 2006 Euro Debt to
    U.S. dollars in the amount of approximately
    $(19) million for Fiscal 2007, $4 million for Fiscal
    2006 and ($18) million for Fiscal 2005.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

Historically, the Company has used floating-rate interest rate
    swap agreements to hedge changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate 1999 Euro Debt. These interest rate swap agreements,
    which effectively converted fixed interest rate payments on the
    Company’s 1999 Euro Debt to a floating-rate basis, were
    designated as a fair value hedge in accordance with
    FAS 133. All interest rate swap agreements were terminated
    in late Fiscal 2006 and there were no outstanding agreements at
    the end of Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006.

During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered
    into three forward-starting interest rate swap contracts
    aggregating €200 million notional amount of
    indebtedness in anticipation of the Company’s proposed
    refinancing of the 1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in
    October 2006. The Company designated these agreements as a cash
    flow hedge of a forecasted transaction to issue new debt in
    connection with the planned refinancing of its 1999 Euro Debt.
    The interest rate swaps hedged a total of
    €200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest
    rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of
    the three interest swap contracts, the Company paid a
    weighted-average fixed rate of interest of 4.1% and received
    variable interest based upon six-month EURIBOR. The Company
    terminated the swaps on September 28, 2006, which was the
    date the interest rate for the 2006 Euro Debt was determined. As
    a result, the Company made a payment of approximately
    €3.5 million ($4.4 million based on the exchange
    rate in effect on that date) in settlement of the swaps. An
    amount of $0.2 million was recognized as a loss for the
    three months ending September 30, 2006 due to the partial
    ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result of the
    forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006 instead
    of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999 Euro
    Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million has been

deferred as a component of comprehensive income within
    stockholders’ equity and is being recognized in income as
    an adjustment to interest expense over the seven-year term of
    the 2006 Euro Debt.

Credit
    Risk

The Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality
    of, the financial institutions that are party to any of its
    financial transactions. Credit risk related to derivative
    financial instruments is considered low because the agreements
    are entered into with strong creditworthy counterparties.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

The Company operates its retail stores under various leasing
    arrangements. The Company also occupies various office and
    warehouse facilities and uses certain equipment under many lease
    agreements. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for under
    the provisions of FAS 13 as either operating leases or
    capital leases. In this context, capital leases include leases
    whereby the Company is considered to have the substantive risks
    of ownership during construction of a leased property pursuant
    to the provisions of

EITF 97-10.

Information on the Company’s operating and capital leasing
    activities is set forth below.

Operating
    Leases

The Company is typically required to make minimum rental
    payments, and often contingent rental payments, under its
    operating leases. Substantially all factory and full-price
    retail store leases provide for contingent rentals based upon
    sales, and certain rental agreements require payment based
    solely on a percentage of sales. Terms of the Company’s
    leases generally contain renewal options, rent escalation
    clauses and landlord incentives. Rent expense, net of sublease
    income which was not significant, was $172 million in
    Fiscal 2007, $137 million in Fiscal 2006 and
    $128 million in Fiscal 2005. Such amounts include
    contingent rental charges of $12 million in Fiscal 2007,
    $12 million in Fiscal 2006 and $10 million in Fiscal
    2005. In addition to such amounts, the Company is normally
    required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to
    the leased real estate properties.

As of March 31, 2007, future minimum rental payments under
    noncancelable operating leases with lease terms in excess of one
    year were as follows:

Employment
    Agreements

The Company has employment agreements with certain executives in
    the normal course of business which provide for compensation and
    certain other benefits. These agreements also provide for
    severance payments under certain circumstances.

Other
    Commitments

Other off-balance sheet firm commitments, which include
    outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding commitments to
    investees, amounted to approximately $36 million as of
    March 31, 2007.

In addition, see Note 5 for a discussion of the
    Company’s purchase price commitments related to the New
    Campaign and Japanese Business Acquisitions.

Litigation

Credit
    Card Matters

The Company is indirectly subject to various claims relating to
    allegations of security breaches in certain of its retail store
    information systems. These claims have been made by various
    credit card associations, issuing banks and credit card
    processors with respect to cards issued by them pursuant to the
    rules imposed by certain credit card issuers, particularly
    Visa

®

and
    MasterCard

®

.
    The allegations include fraudulent credit card charges, the cost
    of replacing credit cards, related monitoring expenses and other
    related claims.

In Fiscal 2005, the Company was subject to various claims
    relating to an alleged security breach of its

point-of-sale

systems that occurred at certain Polo retail stores in the
    U.S. The Company has previously recorded a reserve in an
    aggregate amount of $13 million to provide for its best
    estimate of losses related to these claims. $6.2 million
    was recorded during Fiscal 2005 and the remaining
    $6.8 million of this reserve was recorded during Fiscal
    2006. The Company has paid $11.4 million through
    March 31, 2007 in settlement of these various claims. The
    eligibility period for filing any new claims with respect to
    this matter expired at the end of January 2007.

In addition, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company
    was notified of an alleged compromise of its retail store
    information systems that process its credit card data for
    certain Club Monaco stores in Canada. While the investigation of
    the alleged Club Monaco compromise is ongoing, the evidence to
    date indicates that only numerical credit card data may have
    been accessed and not customer names or contact information. The
    Company’s Canadian credit card processor has thus far
    required the Company to create a reserve of $2 million to
    cover potential claims

relating to this alleged compromise and has deducted funds from
    Club Monaco credit card transactions to establish this reserve.
    Since the Company has been advised by its credit card processor
    that potential claims related to this matter are likely to
    exceed $2 million in the aggregate, the Company has also
    recorded an additional $3 million charge during Fiscal 2007
    to increase the total reserve for this matter to $5 million
    based on its best estimate of exposure. Although claims brought
    against the Company could exceed the amount of the
    $5 million reserve, the ultimate resolution of these claims
    is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s liquidity or financial position.

The Company is cooperating with law enforcement authorities in
    both the U.S. and Canada in their investigations of these
    matters.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd., our domestic
    licensee for luggage and handbags (“Wathne”), filed a
    complaint in the U.S. District Court in the Southern
    District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren, our Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other things,
    federal trademark law violations, breach of contract, breach of
    obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
    misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other relief,
    injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction. A trial date is not yet set for this
    lawsuit on the breach of contract claims but the Company does
    not currently anticipate that a trial will occur prior to
    calendar 2008. We believe this lawsuit to be without merit, we
    have recently moved for summary judgment and we intend to
    continue to contest this lawsuit vigorously. Accordingly,
    management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this
    matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    liquidity or financial position.

Polo
    Trademark Litigation

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit against the
    U.S. Polo Association Inc. (“USPA”), Jordache,
    Ltd. (“Jordache”) and certain other entities
    affiliated with them, alleging that the defendants were
    infringing on our trademarks. In connection with this lawsuit,
    on July 19, 2001, the USPA and Jordache filed a lawsuit
    against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York. This suit, which was effectively a
    counterclaim by them in connection with the original trademark
    action, asserted claims related to our actions in connection
    with our pursuit of claims against the USPA and Jordache for
    trademark infringement and other unlawful conduct. Their claims
    stemmed from our contacts with the USPA’s and
    Jordache’s retailers in which we informed these retailers
    of our position in the original trademark action. All claims and
    counterclaims, except for our claims that the defendants
    violated the Company’s trademark rights, were settled in
    September 2003. We did not pay any damages in this settlement.
    On July 30, 2004, the Court denied all motions for summary
    judgment, and trial began on October 3, 2005 with respect
    to the four “double horseman” symbols that the
    defendants sought to use. On October 20, 2005, the jury
    rendered a verdict, finding that one of the defendant’s
    marks violated our world famous Polo Player Symbol trademark and
    enjoining its further use, but allowing the defendants to use
    the remaining three marks. On November 16, 2005, we filed a
    motion before the trial court to overturn the jury’s
    decision and hold a new trial with respect to the three marks
    that the jury found not to be infringing. The USPA and Jordache
    opposed our motion, but did not move to overturn the jury’s
    decision that the fourth double horseman logo did infringe on
    our trademarks. On July 7, 2006, the judge denied our
    motion to overturn the jury’s decision. On August 4,
    2006, the Company filed an appeal of the judge’s decision
    to deny the Company’s motion for a new trial to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company
    is awaiting a decision from the Court with respect to this
    appeal.

California
    Labor Law Litigation

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of our stores
    filed a lawsuit against the Company and our Polo Retail, LLC
    subsidiary in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Northern California alleging violations of California antitrust
    and labor laws. The plaintiff purported to represent a class of
    employees who had allegedly been injured by a requirement that
    certain retail employees purchase and wear Company apparel as a
    condition of their employment. The complaint, as amended, sought
    an unspecified amount of actual and punitive damages,
    disgorgement of profits and injunctive and declaratory relief.
    The Company answered the amended complaint on November 4,
    2002. A hearing on cross motions for summary judgment on the
    issue of whether the Company’s policies violated California
    law took place on August 14, 2003. The Court granted
    partial summary judgment with respect to certain of the
    plaintiff’s claims, but concluded that more discovery was
    necessary before it could decide the key issue as to whether the
    Company had maintained for a period of time a dress code policy
    that violated California law. On January 12, 2006, a
    proposed settlement of the purported class action was submitted
    to the court for approval. A hearing on the settlement was held
    before the Court on June 29, 2006. On October 26,
    2006, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement
    and agreed to begin the process of sending out claim forms to
    members of the class. On March 28, 2007, the Court granted
    final approval of the settlement and awarded approximately
    $1.1 million to members of the class and their attorneys.
    The Company had previously established a reserve of
    $1.5 million for this matter in Fiscal 2005. The
    Court’s approval of the settlement also resulted in the
    dismissal of the similar purported class action filed in
    San Francisco Superior Court, as described below.

On April 14, 2003, a second putative class action was filed
    in the San Francisco Superior Court. This suit, brought by
    the same attorneys, alleged near identical claims to those in
    the federal class action. The class representatives consisted of
    former employees and the plaintiff in the federal class action.
    Defendants in this class action included us and our Polo Retail,
    LLC, Fashions Outlet of America, Inc., Polo Retail, Inc. and
    San Francisco Polo, Ltd. subsidiaries as well as a
    non-affiliated corporate defendant and two current managers. As
    in the federal class action, the complaint sought an unspecified
    amount of actual and punitive restitution of monies spent, and
    declaratory relief. As noted above, on March 28, 2007, the
    Court granted final approval of the settlement in the federal
    class action, which resulted in the dismissal of this lawsuit.

On March 2, 2006, a former employee at our Club Monaco
    store in Los Angeles, California filed a lawsuit against us in
    the San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations of
    California wage and hour laws. The plaintiff purports to
    represent a class of Club Monaco store employees who allegedly
    have been injured by being improperly classified as exempt
    employees and thereby not receiving compensation for overtime
    and not receiving meal and rest breaks. The complaint seeks an
    unspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement of
    profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. We believe
    this suit is without merit and intend to contest it vigorously.
    Accordingly, management does not expect that the ultimate
    resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s liquidity or financial position.

On June 2, 2006, a second putative class action was filed
    by different attorneys by a former employee of our Club Monaco
    store in Cabazon, California against us in the Los Angeles
    Superior Court alleging virtually identical claims as the
    San Francisco action and consisting of the same class
    members. As in the San Francisco action, the complaint
    sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    disgorgement of profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    relief. On August 21, 2006, the plaintiff voluntarily
    withdrew his lawsuit.

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations
    of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs purport to
    represent a class of employees who allegedly have been injured
    by not properly being paid commission earnings, not being paid
    overtime, not receiving rest breaks, being forced to work off of
    the clock while waiting to enter or leave the store and being
    falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave the store. The
    complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of profits,
    punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive and
    declaratory relief. We believe this suit is without merit and
    intend to

    adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or financial
    position.

French
    Income Tax Audit

The French tax authorities are in the process of auditing one of
    the Company’s French subsidiaries for the taxable years
    2000 through 2005. Among other matters still under review, the
    French tax authorities have asserted that certain intercompany
    royalty payments made by the Company’s French subsidiary to
    a related U.S. subsidiary were excessive and that a portion
    should be disallowed as a deduction under French tax law.

The Company disagrees with the position of the French tax
    authorities that such royalties were excessive. It is expected
    that the matter ultimately will be resolved under the competent
    authority procedures of the US-France Income Tax Treaty in order
    to avoid the double taxation of such income.

Under French tax law, the Company was required to provide bank
    guarantees for the payment of the asserted tax assessment prior
    to resolution under the competent authority procedures.
    Accordingly, the Company has arranged for certain banks to
    guarantee payment to the French tax authorities on behalf of the
    Company in the amount of €41.3 million
    ($55.1 million). In order to secure these guarantees,
    primarily in Fiscal 2007, the Company placed a corresponding
    amount of cash in escrow with the banks as collateral for the
    guarantees. Such cash has been classified as “restricted
    cash” and reported as a component of “other
    assets” in the Company’s accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet. Management does not expect that the ultimate
    resolution of the asserted excess royalties matter will have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition or results of operations.

The French tax authorities are required to complete their audit
    by December 31, 2007. While no significant adjustments
    other than the asserted excess royalty matter have been formally
    proposed by the French tax authorities as of the end of April
    2007, certain tax positions taken by the Company in connection
    with the restructuring of its European operations in Fiscal 2004
    could be challenged. The Company maintains a tax reserve against
    this potential exposure based on its best estimate of the
    probable outcome. However, if asserted, it is reasonably
    possible that an unfavorable settlement could exceed the
    Company’s established reserves by an estimated amount of up
    to approximately $30 million, including related employee
    profit-sharing obligations required under French law based on
    the reassessed higher level of taxable income. Nevertheless,
    management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this
    matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    liquidity or financial condition.

Other
    Matters

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims and
    proceedings involving credit card fraud, trademark and
    intellectual property, licensing, employee relations and other
    matters incidental to our business. We believe that the
    resolution of these other matters currently pending will not
    individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition or results of operations.

    repurchases under the expanded and pre-existing programs
    amounted to 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock
    at a cost of $231.3 million. The remaining availability
    under the common stock repurchase program was
    $368.3 million as of March 31, 2007.

In Fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 69.3 thousand shares of
    Class A common stock at a cost of approximately
    $4 million. No shares of Class A common stock were
    repurchased in Fiscal 2005.

Repurchased shares are accounted for as treasury stock at cost
    and will be held in treasury for future use.

Dividends

Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash
    dividend program of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per
    share on an annual basis, on its common stock. Dividends paid
    amounted to $21 million in Fiscal 2007, $21 million in
    Fiscal 2006 and $22 million in Fiscal 2005.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted FAS 123R
    using the modified prospective application transition method.
    Under this transition method, the compensation expense
    recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of
    operations beginning April 2, 2006 includes compensation
    expense for (a) all stock-based payments granted prior to,
    but not yet vested as of, April 1, 2006, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of FAS 123 and (b) all stock-based payments
    granted subsequent to April 1, 2006, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of FAS 123R.

Transition
    Information

Prior to April 2, 2006, the Company accounted for
    stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method
    in accordance with APB 25 and adopted the disclosure-only
    provisions of FAS 123. Under this standard, the Company did
    not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of stock
    options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the
    market price at the date of grant. However, as required, the
    Company disclosed, in the notes to the consolidated financial
    statements, the pro forma expense impact of the stock option
    grants as if the fair-value-based recognition provisions of
    FAS 123 were applied. Compensation expense was previously
    recognized for restricted

stock and restricted stock units. The effect of forfeitures on
    restricted stock and restricted stock units was recognized when
    such forfeitures occurred.

In accordance with the modified prospective application
    transition method, prior period financial statements have not
    been restated to reflect the effects of implementing
    FAS 123R. The following table presents the Company’s
    pro forma net income and net income per share if compensation
    expense for fixed stock option grants had been determined based
    on the fair value at the grant dates of such awards as defined

Long-term
    Stock Incentive Plan

The Company’s 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as
    amended (the “1997 Plan”), authorizes the grant of
    awards to participants with respect to a maximum of
    26.0 million shares of the Company’s Class A
    common stock; however, there are limits as to the number of
    shares available for certain awards and to any one participant.
    Equity awards that may be made under the 1997 Plan include
    (a) stock options, (b) restricted stock and
    (c) restricted stock units.

Stock
    Options

Stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable ratably
    (a graded-vesting schedule), over a three-year vesting period
    for employees or over a two-year vesting period for non-employee
    directors. Stock options generally expire either seven or ten
    years from the date of grant. The Company recognizes
    compensation expense for share-based awards that have graded
    vesting and no performance conditions on an accelerated basis.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
    estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires
    the input of subjective assumptions. The Company developed its
    assumptions by analyzing the historical exercise behavior of
    employees and non-employee directors. The Company’s
    assumptions used for the fiscal years presented were as follows:

Expected Term

— The estimate of expected term
    is based on the historical exercise behavior of employees and
    non-employee directors, as well as the contractual life of the
    option grants.

F-38

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Expected Volatility

— The expected volatility
    factor is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock for a period equal to the stock
    option’s expected term.

Expected Dividend Yield

— The expected dividend
    yield is based on the regular quarterly cash dividend of
    $0.05 per share.

Risk-free Interest Rate

— The risk-free
    interest rate is determined using the implied yield for a traded
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the
    option’s expected term.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
    following weighted-average assumptions:

As of March 31, 2007, there was $9.7 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock
    options granted and the unrecognized compensation expense is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.1 years.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units
    (“RSUs”)

The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common
    stock and service-based restricted stock units to certain of its
    senior executives. In addition, the Company grants
    performance-based restricted stock units to such senior
    executives and other key executives, and certain other employees
    of the Company.

Restricted shares of Class A common stock, which entitle
    the holder to receive a specified number of shares of
    Class A common stock at the end of a vesting period, are
    accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. In addition,
    holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash
    dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the
    Company’s Class A common stock. Generally, restricted
    stock grants vest over a five-year period of time, subject to
    the executive’s continuing employment.

Restricted stock units entitle the grantee to receive shares of
    Class A common stock at the end of a vesting period.
    Service-based restricted stock units are payable in shares of
    Class A common stock and generally vest over a five-year
    period of time, subject to the executive’s continuing
    employment. Performance-based restricted stock units also are
    payable in shares of Class A common stock and generally
    vest over (1) a three-year period of time (cliff vesting),
    subject to the employee’s continuing employment and the
    Company’s satisfaction of certain performance goals over
    the three-year period; or (2) ratably over a three-year
    period of time (graded vesting), subject to the employee’s
    continuing employment during the applicable vesting period and
    the achievement by the Company of separate annual performance
    goals. In addition, holders of certain restricted stock units
    are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the form of
    additional restricted stock units in connection with the payment
    of dividends on the Company’s Class A common stock.
    Restricted stock units, including shares resulting from dividend
    equivalents paid on such units, are accounted for at fair value
    at the date of grant. The fair value of a restricted security is
    based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A common
    stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those
    restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend
    equivalents. Compensation expense for performance-based
    restricted stock units is recognized over the service period
    when attainment of the performance goals is probable.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Profit
    Sharing Retirement Savings Plans

The Company sponsors two defined contribution benefit plans
    covering substantially all eligible U.S. employees not
    covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include
    a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal
    Revenue Code. The Company makes discretionary contributions to
    the plans and contributes an amount equal to 50% of the first 6%
    of salary contributed by an employee.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is 100% vested in
    Company matching and discretionary contributions after five
    years of credited service. Contributions under these plans
    approximated $4 million, $5 million and
    $4 million in Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005,
    respectively.

Supplemental
    Retirement Plan

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for
    certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the
    401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans are expected to
    be constrained by the operation of certain Internal Revenue Code
    limitations. These supplemental benefits vest over time and the
    compensation expense related to these benefits is recognized
    over the vesting period. The amounts accrued under these plans
    were $26 million and $25 million as of March 31,
    2007 and April 1, 2006, respectively, and are reflected in
    other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets. Total compensation expense related to these
    benefits was $3 million, $5 million and
    $4 million in Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plans

The Company has deferred compensation arrangements for certain
    key executives which generally provide for payments upon
    retirement, death or termination of employment. The amounts
    accrued under these plans were $2 million and
    $1 million as of March 31, 2007 and April 1,
    2006, respectively, and are reflected in other non-current
    liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
    Total compensation expense related to these compensation
    arrangements was $0.3 million for Fiscal 2007,
    $0.3 million for Fiscal 2006 and $0.4 million for
    Fiscal 2005. The Company funds a portion of these obligations
    through the establishment of trust accounts on behalf of the
    executives participating in the plans. The trust accounts are
    reflected in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Union
    Pension Plan

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is
    required to make contributions to the Union of Needletrades
    Industrial and Textile Employees (“Union”) for dues
    based on wages paid to union employees. A portion of these dues
    is allocated by the Union to a retirement fund which provides
    defined benefits to substantially all unionized workers. The
    Company does not participate in the management of the plan and
    has not been furnished with information with respect to the type
    of benefits provided, vested and non-vested benefits or assets.

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a
    multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its
    proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits.
    Such withdrawal liability was assumed in conjunction with the
    acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee.
    The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the
    plan.

International
    Defined Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors certain defined benefit plans at
    international locations, which are not considered to be material
    individually and in the aggregate as of March 31, 2007.
    Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that
    reflect the employees’ years of service and compensation
    levels during their employment period.

Segment
    Information

The Company has three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail and
    Licensing. Such segments offer a variety of products through
    different channels of distribution. The Wholesale segment
    consists of women’s, men’s and children’s
    apparel, accessories and related products which are sold to
    major department stores, specialty stores, golf and pro shops
    and the Company’s owned and licensed retail stores in the
    U.S. and overseas. The Retail segment consists of the
    Company’s worldwide retail operations, which sell products
    through its full-price and factory stores, as well as Polo.com,
    its

e-commerce

website. The stores and website sell products purchased from the
    Company’s licensees, suppliers and Wholesale segment. The
    Licensing segment generates revenues from royalties earned on
    the sale of the Company’s apparel, home and other products
    internationally and domestically through licensing alliances.
    The licensing agreements grant the licensees rights to use the
    Company’s various trademarks in connection with the
    manufacture and sale of designated products in specified
    geographical areas for specified periods.

The accounting policies of the Company’s segments are
    consistent with those described in Note 3. Sales and
    transfers between segments are recorded at cost and treated as
    transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated
    in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating segment
    performance. Each segment’s performance is evaluated based
    upon operating income before restructuring charges and certain
    one-time items, such as legal charges. Corporate overhead
    expenses (exclusive of expenses for senior management, overall
    branding-related expenses and certain other corporate-related
    expenses) are allocated to the segments based upon specific
    usage or other allocation methods.

Related
    Party Transactions

In the ordinary course of conducting its business, the Company
    periodically enters into transactions with other entities or
    people that are considered related parties.

The Company receives royalty payments, pursuant to a licensing
    agreement with Impact 21 that allows Impact 21 to sell high
    quality apparel and related merchandise in Japan using certain
    of the Company’s trademarks. The Company has an
    approximately 20% interest in Impact 21, which is accounted
    for under the equity method of accounting. Royalty payments
    received under this arrangement were approximately
    $34 million in Fiscal 2007, $34 million in Fiscal 2006
    and $34 million in Fiscal 2005. See Note 5 for further

There were no other significant non-cash financing and investing

Licensing-related
    Transactions

Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement

In February 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into
    a ten-year exclusive licensing agreement with Luxottica Group,
    S.p.A. and affiliates (“Luxottica”) for the design,
    production, sale and distribution of prescription frames and
    sunglasses under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand (the “Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement”).

The Eyewear Licensing Agreement took effect on January 1,
    2007 after the Company’s pre-existing licensing agreement
    with another licensee expired. In early January, the Company
    received a prepayment of approximately $180 million, net of
    certain tax withholdings, in consideration of the annual minimum
    royalty and design-services fees to be earned over the life of
    the contract. The prepayment is non-refundable, except with
    respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the Company, in
    which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment as
    determined based on the specific terms of the agreement would be
    required to be repaid. The prepayment was recorded by the
    Company as deferred income and will be recognized in earnings
    when earned in accordance with the terms of the agreement based
    upon the higher of (a) contractually guaranteed minimum
    royalty levels and (b) estimates of sales and royalty data
    received from the licensee.

Underwear
    Licensing Agreement

The Company licensed the right to manufacture and sell
    Chaps-branded underwear under a long-term license agreement,
    which was scheduled to expire in December 2009. During Fiscal
    2007, the Company and the licensee agreed to terminate the
    licensing and related design-services agreements. In connection
    with this agreement, the Company received a portion of the
    minimum royalty and design-service fees due to it under the
    underlying agreements on an accelerated basis. The approximate
    $8 million of proceeds received by the Company has been
    recognized as licensing revenue in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements for Fiscal 2007.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of March 31, 2007 and April 1,
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended March 31, 2007. These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company as of March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006, and
    the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended March 31, 2007, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective April 2, 2006, the Company elected
    application of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements.” As discussed in Note 4 to the
    consolidated financial statements, effective April 2, 2006,
    the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    May 30, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
    2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of March 31, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company has maintained, in
    all material aspects,  effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    March 31, 2007, of the Company and our report dated May 30,
    2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
    statements and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the
    Company’s elected application of Staff Accounting Bulletin
    No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”, and
    the Company’s adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”.
