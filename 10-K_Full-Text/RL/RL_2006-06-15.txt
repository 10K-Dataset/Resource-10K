PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global leader in the design,
    marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products. We
    believe that our global reach, breadth of product and
    multi-channel distribution is unique among luxury and apparel
    companies. We operate in three distinct but integrated segments:
    wholesale, retail and licensing. During the past five years, we
    have continued to develop our business model, expand our
    vertically integrated retail segment, reposition our wholesale
    segment, and maintain a strong licensing segment despite the
    acquisition of several of our key licensed businesses. The
    following tables show our net revenues and operating profit
    (excluding unallocated corporate expenses, legal and
    restructuring charges) by segment for the last three fiscal
    years:

We continue to invest in our business. In the past five years,
    we have invested approximately $1.4 billion for the
    acquisition of several key licensed businesses and capital
    improvements, all fundamentally through strong operating cash
    flow. We intend to continue to execute our long-term strategy of
    expanding our accessories and other product offerings, growing
    our specialty retail store base, and expanding our presence
    internationally.

Seasonality
    of Business

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with greater
    wholesale segment sales in our second and fourth quarters and
    greater retail segment sales in our second and third quarters.
    These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal
    wholesale shipments and key vacation travel and holiday shopping
    periods in the retail segment. As a result of the growth in our
    retail operations and other changes in our business, historical
    quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may
    not be indicative of future performances. In addition,
    fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter
    may be affected by, among other things, the timing of seasonal
    wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.

Recent
    Developments

On March 30, 2006 we opened a wholly-owned Ralph Lauren
    flagship store in the Omotesando shopping district in Tokyo. The
    Omotesando store is expected to raise our luxury image in Japan,
    where our products are also sold in five licensee owned
    specialty stores and over 300 department store
    shops-within-shops.

On February 27, 2006, we signed a ten year license
    agreement with Luxottica Group, S.p.A., (“Luxottica”)
    effective January 1, 2007, for the design, production and
    worldwide distribution of prescription frames and sunglasses
    under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand. The agreement provides for
    Luxottica’s payment of approximately $200 million on
    the effective date, representing the discounted net present
    value of the guaranteed minimum royalties and design service
    payments over the life of the agreement. The approximate
    $200 million prepayment is nonrefundable, except with
    respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the company, in
    which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment would be
    required to be prepaid. The agreement will replace our current
    eyewear license with Safilo S.p.A., which expires on
    December 31, 2006.

In Fiscal 2006, we acquired several businesses that source and
    sell products bearing our trademarks under license in order to
    control key product categories and realize the benefits of
    vertical integration. On February 3, 2006, we acquired all
    of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun
    Apparel, Inc., our licensee for men’s and women’s
    casual apparel and sportswear in the United States and Canada
    (the “Polo Jeans Business”), from Jones Apparel Group,
    Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (“Jones”). The
    acquisition cost was approximately $260 million in cash,
    including $5 million of transaction costs, and the purchase
    price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
    Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements sets forth
    how the purchase price has been preliminary allocated among the
    acquired assets. In addition, simultaneous with the transaction,
    we settled all claims under our litigation with Jones relating
    to the termination on December 31, 2003 of the United
    States and Canadian license and design agreements for the sale
    of products under the “Lauren” trademark for a cost of
    $100 million. Other than inventory, Jones retained the
    right to all working capital balances at the date of closing. We
    have entered into a transition services agreement with Jones to
    provide a variety of operational, financial and information
    systems services over a period of six to twelve months. We
    intend to expand our denim and casual sportswear business by
    introducing new product offerings under our Lauren brand for
    women and Polo brand for men while continuing to distribute Polo
    Jeans — branded products internationally.


On July 15, 2005, we acquired from Reebok International
    Ltd. (“Reebok”) all of the issued and outstanding
    shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear Co., Inc., our
    global licensee for men’s, women’s and children’s
    footwear, together with certain foreign assets owned by
    affiliates of Reebok (collectively, the “Footwear
    Business”). The acquisition cost was approximately $112
    million in cash, including $2 million of transaction costs,
    and is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The purchase
    price was allocated as described in Note 5 of our
    consolidated financial statements. In addition, Reebok and
    certain of its affiliates entered into a transition services
    agreement with the Company to provide a variety of operational,
    financial and information systems services over a period of
    twelve to eighteen months.

In March 2006, we announced a five year arrangement as the first
    exclusive outfitter for all on-court officials at Wimbledon
    through 2010. This follows our four-year arrangement to be the
    official outfitter of all on-court officials at the
    U.S. Open tennis tournament, which began in 2005.

Our
    Wholesale Segment

Our wholesale segment sells our products primarily to leading
    upscale department stores, specialty stores and golf and pro
    shops, both domestically and internationally. We have focused on
    elevating our brand and improving productivity by reducing the
    number of unproductive doors within department stores in which
    our products are sold, improving in-store product assortment and
    presentation, and improving full price sell-throughs to
    consumers. As of April 1, 2006, the end of Fiscal 2006, our
    products were sold in approximately 1,950 domestic
    department stores, and during Fiscal 2006 we invested
    approximately $26 million in shops-within-shops dedicated
    to our products in domestic department stores. We have also
    effected selective price increases on basic products and
    introduced new fashion offerings at higher price points.

Department stores are our major wholesale customers in North
    America and Japan. In Europe, our wholesale sales are a varying
    mix of sales to both department stores and specialty shops,
    depending on the country. Our collection
    brands — Women’s Ralph Lauren Collection and
    Black Label and men’s Purple Label Collection and Black
    Label — are distributed through a limited number
    of premier fashion retailers. In addition, we sell excess and

out-of-season

products through secondary distribution channels.

Worldwide
    Distribution Channels

The following table presents the approximate number of doors
    (excluding our own specialty stores), by channel, in which
    products distributed by our wholesale segment, excluding Chaps,
    were sold to consumers worldwide as of April 1, 2006. In
    addition, during fiscal 2006 our Wholesale Segment launched
    Chaps for women and boys product lines in approximately
    750 department stores.

The following department store chains were the only wholesale
    customers whose purchases represented more than ten percent of
    our worldwide wholesale net sales for the year ended
    April 1, 2006. Although Federated Department Stores, Inc.
    and The May Department Stores Company are shown separately,
    Federated Department Stores acquired The May Department Stores
    by merger on August 30, 2005. Combined, Federated and May
    accounted for approximately 33% of our wholesale net sales in
    Fiscal 2006.

•

Federated Department Stores, Inc., which represented
    approximately 18%,

•

Dillard Department Stores, Inc., which represented 17%, and

•

The May Department Stores Company, which represented 15%.

Federated has announced plans to close or divest itself of more
    than 79 of the combined companies’ stores in calendar 2006
    and to divest itself of the approximately 50 store
    Lord & Taylor division, and is converting the remaining
    stores formerly owned by The May Department Stores to the
    Macy’s name plate. We do not believe that this merger and
    restructuring will have a material adverse effect on our
    business.

Our product brands are sold primarily through their own sales
    forces. Our Wholesale Segment maintain their primary showrooms
    in New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in
    Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, London,
    Munich, Madrid and Stockholm.

Shop-within-Shops.

As a critical
    element of our distribution to department stores, we and our
    licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand
    recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines
    by the department stores and to differentiate the presentation
    of products. Shop-within-shops fixed assets primarily include
    items such as customized freestanding fixtures, moveable wall
    cases and components, decorative items and flooring.

At April 1, 2006, we had approximately 9,100
    shop-within-shops dedicated to our wholesale products worldwide
    and our licensing partners had more than 775 shop-within-shops.
    During Fiscal 2006, we added approximately 1,654
    shop-within-shops. Excluding significantly larger
    shop-within-shops in key department store locations, the size of
    our shop-within-shops typically ranges from approximately 100 to
    4,800 square feet for Polo products, from approximately 240
    to 4,000 square feet for Lauren by Ralph Lauren, from
    approximately 100 to 600 square feet for our Collection
    Brands, and from approximately 300 to 900 square feet for
    Home Furnishings. We share in the cost of these
    shops-within-shops.

Basic Stock Replenishment
    Program.

Basic products such as knit shirts,
    chino pants and oxford cloth shirts can be ordered at any time
    through our basic stock replenishment programs. We generally
    ship these products within one to five days of order receipt.
    These products accounted for approximately 7.4% of our wholesale
    net sales in Fiscal 2006. We have also implemented a seasonal
    quick response program to allow replenishment of products which
    can be ordered only during a portion of the year.

Our
    Retail Segment

Our retail segment consists of 137 full-price retail stores and
    145 outlet stores worldwide, excluding our seven remaining Caban
    home stores, of which we are in the process of disposing by sale
    or closure. The expansion of our full-price retail store base is
    a primary long-term strategic goal. We opened 11 new full-price
    stores in Fiscal 2006, net of store closings, including the
    flagship store in Tokyo, and currently anticipate opening
    between 10 and 15 full-price stores in Fiscal 2007. Our retail
    operating profit rate increased from 3.0% of net sales in Fiscal
    2001 to 9.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2006, reflecting
    improvements in productivity, gross margins, and full-margin
    sell-through rates. Our full price retail stores reinforce the
    luxury image and distinct sensibility of our brands and feature
    exclusive


lines that are not sold in domestic department stores: Blue
    Label for Women, Black Label for Men and Ralph Lauren Home. We
    operated the following full price stores as of April 1,
    2006:

    atmosphere reflecting the distinctive attitude and luxury
    positioning of the Ralph Lauren brand. Our seven flagship Ralph
    Lauren stores showcase our upper-end luxury styles and products
    and demonstrate our most refined merchandising techniques.

•

Club Monaco

stores feature updated fashion apparel and
    accessories for both men and women. The brand’s clean and
    updated classic signature style forms the foundation of a modern
    wardrobe.

•

Rugby

, the newest brand in the Ralph Lauren family, is a
    vertical retail format featuring an aspirational lifestyle
    collection of apparel and accessories for men and women. The
    brand is characterized by a youthful, preppy attitude which
    resonates throughout the line and the store experience.

In addition to generating sales of our products, our worldwide
    full-price stores set, reinforce and capitalize on the image of
    our brands. Our stores range in size from approximately 1,000 to
    over 37,600 square feet. These full-price stores are
    situated in upscale regional malls and major upscale street
    locations, generally in large urban markets. We generally lease
    our stores for initial periods ranging from 5 to 10 years
    with renewal options.

We extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our
    123 domestic Polo Ralph Lauren outlet stores and 21 European
    outlet stores. During Fiscal 2006, we added 1 new Polo Ralph
    Lauren outlet store, net, and closed four of five Club Monaco
    outlet stores. We will close the remaining Club Monaco outlet
    store in Fiscal 2007. Our outlet stores are generally located in
    outlet malls.

•

Outlet stores obtain products directly from us, including our
    retail stores, our product licensing partners and our suppliers.

Polo.com

In addition to our stores, our retail segment sells Ralph Lauren
    products on-line through our

e-commerce

website, Polo.com (http://www.polo.com). Polo.com offers our
    customers access to the full breadth of Ralph Lauren apparel,
    accessories and home product, and allows us to reach retail
    customers on a multi-channel basis and reinforces the luxury
    image of our brands. In Fiscal 2006, Polo.com averaged
    1.8 million unique visitors a month


and had 820,000 customers. Polo.com is owned and operated by
    Ralph Lauren Media, LLC, our consolidated 50% owned joint
    venture with NBC Universal and ValueVision Media, Inc., which
    operates ShopNBC.

Our
    Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight,
    design, and marketing skills with the specific product or
    geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and
    build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners
    who:

•

are leaders in their respective markets,

•

contribute the majority of the product development costs,

•

provide the operational infrastructure required to support the
    business, and

•

own the inventory.

We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell
    at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more
    of our trademarks. We grant our international geographic area
    licensing partners exclusive rights to distribute certain brands
    or classes of our products and operate retail stores in specific
    international territories. These geographic area licensees
    source products from us, our product licensing partners and
    independent sources. Each licensing partner pays us royalties
    based upon its sales of our products, subject, generally, to a
    minimum royalty requirement. Other than our Ralph Lauren Home
    collection licenses, which are discussed below, these payments
    generally range up to 14.0% of the licensing partners’
    sales of the licensed products. In addition, licensing partners
    may be required to allocate a portion of their sales revenues to
    advertise our products and share in the creative costs
    associated with these products. Larger allocations are required
    in connection with launches of new products or in new
    territories. Our licenses generally have 3 to 5 year terms
    and may grant the licensee conditional renewal options.

We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that their
    products are developed, marketed and distributed so as to reach
    the intended market opportunity and to present consistently to
    consumers worldwide the distinctive perspective and lifestyle
    associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design,
    production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution,
    advertising and promotion of Polo Ralph Lauren products are
    subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight. The
    result is a consistent identity for Polo Ralph Lauren products
    across product categories and international markets.

Approximately 26% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal 2006 was
    derived from two product licensing partners: Impact21, one of
    the sublicensees for Japan, and WestPoint Home, Inc, accounted
    for 14% and 12%, respectively, of our licensing revenue in
    Fiscal 2006.

International
    Licenses

We believe that international markets offer additional
    opportunities for our quintessential American designs and
    lifestyle image. We work with our international licensing
    partners to facilitate international expansion. International
    expansion opportunities may include:

•

the roll out of new products and brands following their launch
    in the U.S.,

•

the introduction of additional product lines,

•

the entrance into new international markets, and

•

the addition of Ralph Lauren or Polo Ralph Lauren stores in
    these markets.

    operates principally through sublicensees, including Impact21
    Co., Ltd., mens’ and womens’ apparel and accessories
    and Polo Jeans, Naigai, childrens and golf apparel and hosiery,
    and Hitomi casual wear.

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to
    source, produce, market

and/or

sell
    various categories of our products in a given geographic area.
    These rights may include the right to own and operate retail
    stores. The economic arrangements are similar to those of our
    product licensing partners. We design licensed products either
    alone or in collaboration with our domestic licensing partners.
    Our product licensees whose territories do not include the
    international geographic area licensees’ territories
    generally provide our international licensing partners with
    product or patterns, piece goods, manufacturing locations and
    other information and assistance necessary to achieve product
    uniformity, for which they are often compensated.

As of April 1, 2006, our international licensing partners
    operated 13 Ralph Lauren stores, 29 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, 28
    Polo Jeans stores, 2 Children’s stores and 4 Polo outlet
    stores.

Ralph
    Lauren Home

Together with our licensing partners, we offer an extensive
    collection of home products that draw upon and further the
    design themes of our other product lines, contributing to our
    complete lifestyle concept. Products are sold under the Ralph
    Lauren Home and Lauren Ralph Lauren brands in three primary
    categories: bedding and bath, home décor and home
    improvement. As of April 1, 2006, we had agreements with
    eight domestic and two international home product licensing
    partners.

We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home
    licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners.
    These services include design, operating showrooms, marketing,
    advertising and, in some cases, sales. As a result, we receive a
    higher average royalty rate from our Ralph Lauren Home
    collection licensing partners, typically ranging from 15.0% to
    20.0%. In general, the licensing partners manufacture, own the
    inventory and ship the products. Our Ralph Lauren Home licensing
    alliances generally have 3 to 5 year terms and may grant
    the licensee conditional renewal options.

Ralph Lauren Home products are positioned at the upper tiers of
    their respective markets and are offered at a range of price
    levels. These products are generally distributed through several
    channels of distribution, including department stores, specialty
    home furnishings stores, interior design showrooms, customer
    direct mail catalogs, home centers and the Internet as well as
    our own stores. As with our other products, the use of
    shop-within-shops is central to our department store
    distribution strategy.

Product
    Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative American style
    associated with and defined by Ralph Lauren and our design team.
    Our consistent emphasis on innovative and distinctive design has
    been an important contributor to the prominence, strength and
    reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.

All Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the
    direction of, Ralph Lauren and our design staff, which is
    divided into seven departments: Menswear, Womenswear, Lauren,
    Children’s, Accessories, Home and Club Monaco. We form
    design teams around our brands and product categories to develop
    concepts, themes and products for each brand and category. These
    teams support all three segments of our
    business — wholesale, retail and
    licensing — through close collaboration with
    merchandising, sales and production staff and licensing partners
    in order to gain market and other input.

Marketing

Our marketing program communicates the themes and images of our
    brands and is an integral feature of our product offering.
    Worldwide marketing is managed on a centralized basis through
    our advertising and public relations departments in order to
    ensure consistency of presentation.

We create distinctive image advertising for all our products,
    conveying the particular message of each brand within the
    context of our core themes. Advertisements generally portray a
    lifestyle rather than a specific item and often include a
    variety of products offered by both ourselves and our licensing
    partners. Our primary advertising medium is print, with multiple
    page advertisements appearing regularly in a range of fashion,
    lifestyle and general interest magazines. Major print
    advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and spring
    retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to coincide
    with product deliveries. In addition to print, some product
    categories have utilized television and outdoor media in their
    marketing programs for certain product categories. Our Polo.com

e-commerce

website presents the Ralph Lauren lifestyle on the internet
    while offering the full breadth of our apparel, accessories and
    home products.

If our domestic licensing partners are required to spend an
    amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on
    advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their
    behalf.


We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each
    of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at
    major fashion shows in New York City, which typically generate
    extensive domestic and international media coverage. We
    introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at
    major fashion shows in cities such as New York or Milan, Italy.
    In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our models and
    sponsors, professional golfers, snowboarders and triathletes. In
    March 2006, we announced a five year arrangement as the first
    exclusive outfitter for all on-court officials at Wimbledon
    through 2010. This follows our four-year arrangement to be the
    official outfitter of all on-court officials at the
    U.S. Open tennis tournament, which began in 2005.

Sourcing,
    Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own
    or operate any production facilities. Over 350 different
    manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel products. We source
    both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include
    fabric, buttons and other trim and are sourced primarily with
    respect to our collection brands. Finished products consist of
    manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to
    our customers. As part of our efforts to reduce costs and
    enhance the efficiency of our sourcing process, we have shifted
    a substantial portion of our sourcing to foreign suppliers. In
    Fiscal 2006, less than 1%, by dollar volume, of our products
    were produced in the United States, and over 99%, by dollar
    volume, were produced outside the U.S., primarily in Asia,
    Europe and South America. See “Import Restrictions and
    other Government Regulations” and “Risk
    Factors — Risks Related to Our
    Business — Our business is subject to government
    regulations and other risks associated with importing
    products.”

Two manufacturers engaged by us accounted for approximately 15%
    and 10% of our total production during Fiscal 2006,
    respectively. The primary production facilities of these two
    manufacturers are located in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau,
    Philippines, Saipain, Singapore and Sri Lanka.

Our wholesale segment must commit to manufacture the majority of
    our garments before we receive customer orders. We also must
    commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance of our
    sales. If we overestimate our primary customers’ demand for
    a particular product, we may sell the excess in our outlet
    stores or sell the product through secondary distribution
    channels. If we overestimate the need for a particular fabric or
    yarn, that fabric or yarn may be used in garments made for
    subsequent seasons or made into past seasons’ styles for
    distribution in our outlet stores.

We have been working closely with suppliers in recent years to
    reduce the lead times for fulfillment (

e.g.,

shipment) of
    orders and to permit re-orders of successful programs. In
    particular, we have increased the number of deliveries within
    certain brands each season so that merchandise is kept fresh at
    the retail level.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global
    manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia,
    South America and Europe. All garments are produced according to
    our specifications. Production and quality control staff in the
    United States, South America, Asia and Europe monitor
    manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct
    problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have
    been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance
    programs, so that quality assurance is focused upon as early as
    possible in the production process, allowing merchandise to be
    received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers
    with minimal interruption.

Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and
    consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with
    numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories,
    fragrances and home furnishing products, domestic and foreign.
    Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
    substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on
    the basis of fashion, quality and service, which depend on our
    ability to:

•

anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely
    manner;

•

maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

develop and produce high quality products that appeal to
    consumers;


•

appropriately price our products;

•

provide strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensure product availability; and

•

obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present our
    products at retail.

See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the
    Industry in Which we Compete — We face intense
    competition in the worldwide apparel industry.”

Distribution

To facilitate distribution domestically, Ralph Lauren men’s
    and women’s products are shipped from manufacturers
    primarily to our distribution center in Greensboro, North
    Carolina for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment to retail
    customers. Ralph Lauren Childrenswear product is shipped from
    our manufacturers to a leased distribution center in
    Martinsburg, West Virginia. In addition, we utilize third party
    logistics providers to manage selected programs for specific
    customers. These facilities are designed to allow for high
    density cube storage and utilize bar code technology to provide
    inventory management and carton controls. Product traffic
    management is also coordinated from these facilities. European
    distribution and warehousing has been largely consolidated into
    one third party facility located in Parma, Italy.

Our full-price store and outlet store distribution and
    warehousing are principally handled through the Greensboro
    distribution center. Club Monaco products are distributed from
    facilities in Ontario, Canada, New Jersey and California.

ValueVision Media, which operates ShopNBC, currently performs
    warehousing, order fulfillment and call center functions for
    Ralph Lauren Media, LLC, which operates our Polo.com

e-commerce

website. ValueVision Media and NBC Universal are our partners in
    Ralph Lauren Media, LLC. Ralph Lauren Media, LLC anticipates
    bringing warehouse, order fulfillment and call center functions
    in-house in Fiscal 2008.

Management
    Information Systems

Our management information systems make the marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution of our products more
    efficient by providing, among other things:

•

comprehensive order processing;

•

production information;

•

accounting information; and

•

an enterprise view of information for our marketing,
    manufacturing, importing and distribution functions.

The

point-of-sale

registers in our stores enable us to track inventory from store
    receipt to final sale on a real-time basis. We believe our
    merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our

point-of-sale

registers and software programs, allow for rapid stock
    replenishment, concise merchandise planning and real-time
    inventory accounting.

We also utilize a sophisticated automated replenishment system
    to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from
    our wholesale customers, the movement of goods through
    distribution channels, and the collection of information for
    planning and forecasting. We have a collaborative relationship
    with many of our suppliers that enables the Company to reduce
    cash to cash cycles in the management of our inventory. In
    Fiscal 2006, we began implementing a new, global enterprise
    resource management system for our wholesale segment. We
    anticipate completing the implementation of this system across
    all of our wholesale divisions by the end of fiscal 2008.


Wholesale
    Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise
    primarily to major department stores and extend credit based on
    an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition,
    usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels
    and the financial condition of our customers on a continuing
    basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor our accounts
    receivables or maintain credit insurance to manage the risks of
    bad debts. Our bad debt write-offs were $4.3 million in
    Fiscal 2006, representing less than one percent of net revenues.
    See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
    Business — Our business could be negatively
    impacted by any financial instability of our customers.”

Wholesale
    Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products
    approximately three to five months prior to the time the
    products are delivered to stores. Such orders are generally
    subject to broad cancellation rights. As of April 1, 2006,
    our summer and fall backlog was $291 million and
    $746 million, respectively, compared to $252 million
    and $525 million, respectively, at April 2, 2005. Our
    backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing
    of the market weeks for our particular lines, during which a
    significant percentage of our orders are received, and the
    timing of shipments. As a consequence, a comparison of backlog
    from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not
    be indicative of eventual shipments.

Trademarks

We own the “Polo,” “Ralph Lauren” and the
    famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the United
    States. Other trademarks we own include:

•

“Lauren/Ralph Lauren”

•

“RRL”

•

“Club Monaco”

•

“Rugby”

•

“RLX”

•

“Chaps”

•

Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics

Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks

“Ralph Lauren,” “Double RL”

and

“RRL”

in perpetuity in connection with, among
    other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks

“Double RL”

and

“RRL”

are
    currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned
    by Mr. Lauren. In addition, Mr. Lauren has the right
    to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical
    productions (not including or relating to our business) through
    RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by
    Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact
    on the Company.

Our trademarks are the subjects of registrations and pending
    applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items
    of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings and
    beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services,
    and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration
    of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and
    enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the
    products and services and the required registration renewals are
    filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other
    proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely
    valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide
    basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. See
    Item 3 — “Legal Proceedings.” As a
    result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been
    the object of counterfeiting. We have a broad enforcement
    program which has been generally effective in controlling the
    sale of counterfeit products in the United States and in major
    markets abroad.

In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some or
    all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the
    course of our international expansion, we have experienced
    conflicts with various third parties


who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks,
    including

“Polo”

and/or a representation of a
    polo player astride a horse, which would impede our use and
    registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts
    are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue
    our international expansion, we have generally successfully
    resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action
    and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the
    conflicting marks. See “Risk Factors — Risks
    Related to Our Business — Our trademarks and
    other intellectual property rights may not be adequately
    protected outside the United States” and
    Item 3 — “Legal Proceedings.”
    Although we have not in the past suffered any material
    restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable
    markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant
    impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product
    offerings and additional trademarks to new markets.

We currently have an agreement with a third party which owned
    conflicting registrations of the trademarks

“Polo”

and a polo player astride a horse in the United Kingdom,
    Hong Kong and South Africa. Under the agreement, the third party
    retains the right to use the “Polo” and polo player
    symbol marks in South Africa and all other countries that
    comprise

Sub-Saharan

Africa, and we agreed to restrict use of those Polo marks in
    those countries to fragrances and cosmetics solely as part of
    the composite trademark

“Ralph Lauren”

and the
    polo player symbol, as to which our use is unlimited, and to the
    use of the polo player symbol mark on women’s and
    girls’ apparel and accessories and women’s and
    girls’ handkerchiefs. By agreeing to those restrictions, we
    secured the unlimited right to use our trademarks in the United
    Kingdom and Hong Kong without payment of any kind, and the third
    party is prohibited from distributing products under those
    trademarks in those countries.

Import
    Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the United
    States, Canada, and Europe is subject to duties. Until
    January 1, 2005, our apparel merchandise was also subject
    to quotas. Quotas represent the right, pursuant to bilateral or
    other international trade arrangements, to export amounts of
    certain categories of merchandise into a country or territory
    pursuant to a visa or license. Pursuant to the Agreement on
    Textiles and Clothing, quotas on textile and apparel products
    were eliminated for World Trade Organization (the
    “WTO”) member countries, including the United States,
    Canada and European countries, on January 1, 2005.
    Notwithstanding quota elimination, China’s accession
    agreement for membership in the WTO provides that WTO member
    countries (including the United States, Canada and European
    countries) may re-impose quotas on specific categories of
    products in the event it is determined that imports from China
    have surged and are threatening to create a market disruption
    for such categories of products (so called “safeguard quota
    provisions”). In response to surging imports, in November
    2005 the United States and China agreed to a new quota
    arrangement which will impose quotas on certain textile products
    through the end of 2008. In addition, the European Union also
    agreed with China on a new textile arrangement which imposed
    quotas through the end of 2007. The United States and other
    countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in
    response to a particular product being imported (from China or
    other countries) in such increased quantities as to cause (or
    threaten) serious damage to the relevant domestic industry
    (generally known as “anti-dumping” actions). The
    European Union has imposed anti-dumping duties on imports from
    China and Vietnam in certain footwear categories. In addition,
    China has imposed an export tax on all textile products
    manufactured in China. Although there can be no assurance, we do
    not believe this tax will have a material impact on our business.

We are also subject to other international trade agreements and
    regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,
    the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean
    Basin Initiative. In addition, each of the countries in which
    our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports.
    Because the United States and the other countries in which our
    products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time,
    impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls
    or restrictions, including the imposition of “safeguard
    quota”, or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates
    or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of
    import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our
    potential exposure to import related risks through, among other
    measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts
    of production among countries and manufacturers, as well as
    through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all our products are manufactured by foreign
    suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the
    administration of current international trade regulations,
    executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in
    sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quota could
    adversely affect our operations. Although we


generally expect that the recent elimination of quotas will
    result, over the long term, in an overall reduction in the cost
    of apparel produced abroad, the implementation of any
    “safeguard quota provisions” or any
    “anti-dumping” actions may result, over the near term,
    in cost increases for certain categories of products and in
    disruption of the supply chain for certain products categories.
    See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” below.

Apparel and other products sold by Polo are also be subject to
    regulation in the United States and other countries by other
    governmental agencies, including, in the United States, the
    Federal Trade Commission, United States Fish and Wildlife
    Service and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These
    regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing
    requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in
    substantial compliance with those regulations as well as
    applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and
    regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to
    the environment. We do not estimate any significant capital
    expenditures for environmental control matters either in the
    current year or in the near future. Our licensed products and
    licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our
    agreements require our licensing partners to operate in
    compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are not aware
    of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a
    material adverse effect on our business.

Although we have not suffered any material inhibition from doing
    business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that
    significant impediments will not arise in the future as we
    expand product offerings and additional trademarks to new
    markets.

Employees

As of April 1, 2006, we had approximately 12,800 employees,
    consisting of approximately 10,000 in the United States and
    approximately 2,800 in foreign countries. Approximately 38 of
    our United States production and distribution employees in the
    womenswear business are members of the Union of Needletrades,
    Industrial & Textile Employees under an industry
    association collective bargaining agreement, which our
    womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations
    with both our union and non-union employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking
    statements contained in this

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
    business, our operating results, our financial condition and the
    actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements
    are made in this report.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

The loss
    of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or other key personnel
    could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Mr. Ralph Lauren’s leadership in the design, marketing
    and operational areas of our business has been a critical
    element of our success. The death or disability of
    Mr. Lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his
    services, or any negative market or industry perception with
    respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material
    adverse effect on our business. Our other executive officers and
    other members of senior management have substantial experience
    and expertise in our business and have made significant
    contributions to our growth and success. The unexpected loss of
    services of one or more of these individuals could also
    adversely affect us. We are not protected by a material amount
    of key-man or similar life insurance covering Mr. Lauren,
    our other executive officers and certain other members of senior
    management. We have entered into employment agreements with
    Mr. Lauren and our other executive officers.

We cannot
    assure the successful implementation of our growth
    strategy.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands,
    expand our geographic coverage and increase direct management of
    our brands by opening more of our own stores, strategically
    acquiring select licensees and


enhancing our operations. Implementation of our strategy
    involves the continued expansion of our business in Europe, Asia
    and other international areas. As discussed elsewhere in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we acquired our previously licensed Polo Jeans and Footwear
    licenses in Fiscal 2006. We may have difficulty integrating
    acquired businesses into our operations, hiring and retaining
    qualified key employees, or otherwise successfully managing such
    expansion. In addition, Europe, as a whole, lacks the large
    wholesale distribution channels found in the United States, and
    we may have difficulty developing successful distribution
    strategies and alliances in each of the major European countries.

Implementation of our strategy also involves the continued
    expansion of our network of retail stores, both in the United
    States and abroad. We may not be able to purchase or lease
    desirable store locations or renew existing store leases on
    acceptable terms. Furthermore, we may not be able to
    successfully integrate the business of any licensee that we
    acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost
    savings or synergies from such integration.

Our
    business could suffer as a result of consolidations,
    restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail
    industry.

Several of our department store customers, including some under
    common ownership, account for significant portions of our
    wholesale net sales. We believe that a substantial portion of
    sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing
    partners, including sales made by our sales force of Ralph
    Lauren Home products, are also made to our largest department
    store customers. In Fiscal 2006, sales to Federated Department
    Stores, Inc. represented 18% of our wholesale net sales, sales
    to Dillard Department Stores, Inc. represented 17%, and sales to
    The May Department Stores Company represented 15%. Federated
    Department Stores and The May Department Stores merged in August
    2005. Federated has announced plans to close more than 79 of the
    combined companies’ stores in calendar 2006 and to divest
    itself of the 55 store Lord & Taylor division and is
    converting the remaining stores formerly owned by The May
    Department Stores to the Macy’s name plate. In the
    aggregate, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately
    72% of our wholesale net sales during Fiscal 2006. There can be
    no assurance that consolidations in the department store sector
    will not have a material adverse effect on our wholesale
    business.

We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our
    customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
    commitments with our customers for each of our lines every
    season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores
    or any other significant customer, whether motivated by
    competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
    decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our
    licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business
    with us or our licensing partners, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business or financial condition. See
    “BUSINESS — Operations — Customers
    and Service.”

Our
    business could be negatively impacted by any financial
    instability of our customers.

We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department
    stores across the United States and Europe and extend credit
    based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial
    condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the
    financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail
    business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk
    relating to that customer’s receivables. Three of our
    customers, Dillard Department Stores, Inc., Federated Department
    Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company, in the
    aggregate constituted 45% of trade accounts receivable
    outstanding at April 1, 2006. As noted above, Federated
    Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company merged in
    August 2005. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts
    receivable from any one of these customers could have a material
    adverse effect on our business or financial condition. See
    “BUSINESS — Credit Control.”

Our
    business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer’s
    inability to produce our goods on time and to our
    specifications.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend
    exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of
    all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our
    specifications primarily by international manufacturers. During
    Fiscal 2006, less than 1%, by dollar value, of our men’s
    and women’s


products were manufactured in the United States and over 99%, by
    dollar value, of these products were manufactured in Asia and
    other countries. Two of the manufacturers engaged by us
    accounted for approximately 15% and 10% of our total production
    during Fiscal 2006. The primary production facilities of these
    two manufacturers are located in Asia. The inability of a
    manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner
    or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the
    delivery date requirements of our customers for those items,
    which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept
    deliveries or a substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of
    which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our
    business could suffer if we need to replace
    manufacturers.

We compete with other companies for the production capacity of
    our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these
    competitors have greater financial and other resources than we
    have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for
    production and import quota capacity. If we experience a
    significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
    of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party
    manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional
    capacity will be available when required on terms that are
    acceptable to us. See “BUSINESS — Sourcing,
    Production and Quality.” We enter into a number of purchase
    order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery,
    method of payment, design and quality specifications and other
    standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term
    contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we
    use produce our products exclusively.

Our
    business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use
    acceptable labor practices.

We require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers
    to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote
    ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and
    monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do
    not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The
    violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer
    used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence
    of an independent manufacturer’s or licensing
    partner’s labor practices from those generally accepted as
    ethical in the United States, could interrupt, or otherwise
    disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our
    reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
    business is subject to risks associated with importing
    products.

As of April 1, 2006, we source a significant portion of our
    products outside the United States through arrangements with
    over 350 foreign vendors in various countries. In Fiscal 2006,
    over 99%, by dollar value, of our products were produced outside
    the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe and South America. Risks
    inherent in importing our products include:

•

quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements with China and
    non-WTO countries. These agreements limit the amount and type of
    goods that may be imported annually from these countries;

•

changes in social, political and economic conditions or
    terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from
    the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are
    located;

•

the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or
    exports;

•

the imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports or exports;

•

significant fluctuations of the cost of raw materials;

•

significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security
    considerations;

•

the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings
    resulting in the potential assessment of special antidumping or
    countervailing duties; and

•

the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties
    either by the United States or its trading partners to remedy
    perceived illegal actions by national governments.


Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

We are
    dependent upon the revenue generated by our licensing
    alliances.

Approximately 30% of our income from operations for Fiscal 2006
    was derived from licensing revenue received from our licensing
    partners. Approximately 26% of our licensing revenue for Fiscal
    2006 was derived from two licensing partners: Impact21, 14%, and
    WestPoint Home, Inc., 12%. We had no other licensing partner
    which accounted for more than 10% of our licensing revenue in
    Fiscal 2006. The interruption of the business of any one of our
    material licensing partners due to any of the factors discussed
    immediately below could also adversely affect our licensing
    revenues and net income.

We rely
    on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our
    licenses.

The risks associated with our own products also apply to our
    licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks
    specific to a licensing partner’s business, including, for
    example, risks associated with a particular licensing
    partner’s ability to:

•

obtain capital;

•

manage its labor relations;

•

maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

manage its credit risk effectively; and

•

maintain relationships with its customers.

Although some of our license agreements prohibit licensing
    partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our
    competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded
    from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered
    by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of
    sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are
    also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
    control over our licensing partners’ products and
    advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other
    things, operational and financial control over their businesses.

Failure
    to maintain licensing partners could harm our
    business.

Although we believe in most circumstances we could replace
    existing licensing partners if necessary, our inability to do so
    for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both
    directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly
    from reduced sales of our other products. See
    “Operations — Our Licensing Alliances.”

Our
    trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
    adequately protected outside the United States.

We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are
    extremely important to our success and our competitive position.
    We devote substantial resources to the establishment and
    protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities
    worldwide. Significant counterfeiting of our products continues,
    however, and in the course of our international expansion we
    have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have
    acquired or claimed ownership rights in some trademarks that
    include Polo

and/or

a
    representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise
    have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past
    resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action
    and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken
    to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary
    rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material


adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation
    of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and
    proprietary rights of others. Also, there can be no assurance
    that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of,
    trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will
    be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
    satisfaction or at all. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
    countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
    as do the laws of the United States. See “Trademarks,”
    and Item 3 “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.”

Our
    business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency
    fluctuations.

We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars.
    However, we source most of our products overseas. As a result,
    the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the
    value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
    rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
    currency denominated prices at which our international
    businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales
    and licensing revenue generally is derived from sales in foreign
    currencies. These foreign currencies include the Japanese Yen,
    the Euro and the Pound Sterling, and this revenue could be
    materially affected by currency fluctuations. Although we hedge
    some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure you
    that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material
    adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations. See Item 7 “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
    AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources.”

Our
    ability to conduct business in international markets may be
    affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
    risks.

Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets
    and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing
    international markets is subject to risks associated with
    international operations. These include:

•

the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets.

We are also subject to general political and economic risks in
    connection with our international operations, including:

•

political instability and terrorist attacks;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other
    similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States, the
    European Union, Japan, or other countries upon the import or
    export of our products in the future, or what effect any of
    these actions would have on our business, financial condition or
    results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical,
    social or economic policies and other factors may have a
    material adverse effect on our business in the future or may
    require us to modify our current business practices.

Risks
    Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete

We face
    intense competition in the worldwide apparel industry.

We face a variety of intense competitive challenges from other
    domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel and casual apparel
    producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more
    diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources
    than we have. We compete with these companies primarily on the
    basis of:

•

anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition;


•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors
    and styles that appeal to consumers;

•

appropriately pricing products;

•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain
    efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective
    presentation of our products at retail.

We also face increasing competition from companies selling
    apparel and home products through the Internet. Although our
    Ralph Lauren Media, LLC joint venture sells our products through
    the internet, increased competition in the worldwide apparel,
    accessories and home product industries from Internet-based
    competitors could reduce our sales, prices and margins and
    adversely affect our results of operations.

The
    success of our business depends on our ability to respond to
    constantly changing fashion trends and consumer
    demands.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate
    and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as
    to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of
    consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty
    and are subject to rapid change. We cannot assure you that we
    will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
    successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the
    future. In addition, we cannot assure you that any new products
    or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by
    consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and
    respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion
    trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of
    our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold
    inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may be
    forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of
    excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business. At
    the same time, our focus on tight management of inventory may
    result, from time to time, in our not having an adequate supply
    of products to meet consumer demand and cause us to lose sales.
    See “BUSINESS — Sourcing, Production and
    Quality.”

A
    downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of
    discretionary items and luxury retail products, which could
    adversely affect our sales.

The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many factors
    affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel, cosmetic,
    fragrance and home products industries, including, among others:

•

general business conditions;

•

interest rates;

•

the availability of consumer credit;

•

taxation; and

•

consumer confidence in future economic conditions.

Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail
    products, including our products, may decline during
    recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income
    is lower. A downturn in the economies in which we, or our
    licensing partners, sell our products may adversely affect our
    revenues and profits materially.

We paid aggregate rent in Fiscal 2006 of approximately
    $38 million for our non-retail facilities. We anticipate
    that we will be able to extend those leases which expire in the
    near future on terms satisfactory to us or relocate to
    facilities timely and on acceptable terms.

As of April 1 2006, the Company operated 289 retail stores,
    totaling 2.3 million square feet. Aggregate annual rentals
    for retail space in Fiscal 2006 totaled approximately
    $99 million. We anticipate that we will be able to extend
    those leases which expire in the near future on satisfactory
    terms or relocate to desirable locations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Since June 2003, we had been involved in litigation with Jones
    Apparel Group, Inc. (“Jones”), primarily relating to
    certain alleged breaches of the terms of the Lauren license
    agreements between the parties. Among other things, Jones sought
    compensatory damages of $550 million and punitive damages.
    In February 2006, simultaneous with our acquisition of the Polo
    Jeans Business from Jones, we settled all claims regarding the
    litigation at a negotiated cost of $100 million. The
    settlement amount equaled the reserve initially established by
    the Company during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005.
    Accordingly, the settlement had no effect on the Company’s
    consolidated operating results for Fiscal 2006.

We are indirectly subject to various claims relating to an
    alleged security breach in 2004 of our retail point of sale
    system, including fraudulent credit card charges, the cost of
    replacing cards and related monitoring expenses and other
    related claims. These claims have been made by various banks
    with respect to credit cards issued by them pursuant to the
    rules of
    Visa

®

and
    MasterCard

®

credit card associations. We recorded an initial charge of
    $6.2 million to establish a reserve for this matter in the
    fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, representing management’s
    best estimate at the time of the probable loss incurred. In
    September 2005, we were notified by our agent bank that the
    aggregate amount of claims had increased to $12 million,
    with an estimated $1 million of additional claims yet to be
    asserted. Accordingly, we recorded an additional
    $6.8 million charge during the second quarter of Fiscal
    2006. The ultimate outcome of this matter could differ
    materially from the amounts recorded and could be material to
    the


results of operations for any affected period. However,
    management does not expect that the ultimate resolution will
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity
    or financial position.

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd., our domestic
    licensee for luggage and handbags (“Wathne”), filed a
    complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren, our Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other things,
    Federal trademark law violations, breach of contract, breach of
    obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
    misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other relief,
    injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the Federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the Court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction against our production and sale of
    men’s and women’s handbags. On May 16, 2006, a
    discovery schedule running through November 2006 was established
    for this case. We believe this suit to be without merit and will
    continue to contest it vigorously.

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit against the United
    States Polo Association Inc., Jordache, Ltd. and certain other
    entities affiliated with them, alleging that the defendants were
    infringing on our trademarks. In connection with this lawsuit,
    on July 19, 2001, the United States Polo Association and
    Jordache filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of New York. This suit,
    which was effectively a counterclaim by them in connection with
    the original trademark action, asserted claims related to our
    actions in our pursuit of claims against the United States Polo
    Association and Jordache for trademark infringement and other
    unlawful conduct. Their claims stemmed from our contacts with
    the United States Polo Association’s and Jordache’s
    retailers in which we informed these retailers of our position
    in the original trademark action. All claims and counterclaims,
    except for our claims that the defendants violated the
    Company’s trademark rights, were settled in September 2003.
    We did not pay any damages in this settlement.

On July 30, 2004, the Court denied all motions for summary
    judgment, and trial began on October 3, 2005 with respect
    to four “double horseman” symbols that the defendants
    sought to use. On October 20, 2005, the jury rendered a
    verdict, finding that one of the defendants’ marks violated
    our world famous Polo Player Symbol trademark and enjoining its
    further use, but allowing the defendants to use the remaining
    three marks. On November 16, 2005, we filed a motion before
    the trial court to overturn the jury’s decision and hold a
    new trial with respect to the three marks that the jury found
    not to be infringing. The USPA and Jordache have opposed our
    motion, but have not moved to overturn the jury’s decision
    that the fourth double horseman logo did infringe on our
    trademarks. Pending the judge’s ruling on our motion, it is
    our belief that the USPA and Jordache cannot produce or sell
    products bearing any of the double horseman marks. We have
    preserved our rights to appeal if our motion is denied.

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of the
    Company’s stores filed a lawsuit against us in the United
    States District Court for the District of Northern California
    alleging violations of California antitrust and labor laws. The
    plaintiff purported to represent a class of employees who had
    allegedly been injured by a requirement that certain retail
    employees purchase and wear Company apparel as a condition of
    their employment. The complaint, as amended, seeks an
    unspecified amount of actual and punitive damages, disgorgement
    of profits and injunctive and declaratory relief. The Company
    answered the amended complaint on November 4, 2002. A
    hearing on cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of
    whether the Company’s policies violated California law
    occurred on August 14, 2003. The Court granted partial
    summary judgment with respect to certain of the plaintiff’s
    claims, but concluded that more discovery was necessary before
    it could decide the key issue as to whether the Company had
    maintained for a period of time a dress code policy that
    violated California law. On January 12, 2006, a proposed
    settlement of the purported class action was submitted to the
    court for approval. A hearing on the settlement has been
    scheduled for June 29, 2006. The proposed settlement cost
    of $1.5 million does not exceed the reserve for this matter
    that we established in Fiscal 2005. The proposed settlement
    would also result in the dismissal of the similar purported
    class action filed in San Francisco Superior Court as
    described below.


On April 14, 2003, a second punitive class action was filed
    in the San Francisco Superior Court. This suit, brought by
    the same attorneys, alleges near identical claims to those in
    the federal class action. The class representatives consist of
    former employees and the plaintiff in the federal court action.
    Defendants in this class action include us and our Polo Retail,
    LLC, Fashions Outlet of America, Inc., Polo Retail, Inc. and
    San Francisco Polo, Ltd. as well as a non-affiliated
    corporate defendant and two current managers. As in the federal
    action, the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of actual and
    punitive restitution of monies spent, and declaratory relief. If
    the judge in the federal class action accepts the proposed
    settlement, the state court class action would subsequently be
    dismissed.

On March 2, 2006, a former employee at our Club Monaco
    store in Los Angeles, California filed a lawsuit against us in
    the San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations of
    California wage and hour laws. The plaintiff purports to
    represent a class of Club Monaco store employees who allegedly
    have been injured by being improperly classified as exempt
    employees and thereby not receiving compensation for overtime
    and not receiving meal and rest breaks. The complaint seeks an
    unspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement of
    profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. We believe
    this suit is without merit and intend to contest it vigorously.

On June 2, 2006, a second punitive class action was filed
    by different attorneys on behalf of a former employee of our
    Club Monaco store in Cabazon, California against us in the Los
    Angeles Superior Court alleging virtually identical claims as to
    the San Francisco action and consisting of the same class
    members. As in the San Francisco action, the complaint
    seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    disgorgement of profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    relief. We believe this suit is without merit and intend to
    contest it vigorously.

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations
    of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs purport to
    represent a class of employees who allegedly have been injured
    by not properly being paid commission earnings, not being paid
    overtime, not receiving rest breaks, and being forced to work
    off the clock while waiting to enter or leave the store and
    being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave the store. The
    complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of profits,
    punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive and
    declaratory relief. We believe this suit is without merit and
    intend to contest it vigorously.

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims
    involving trademark and intellectual property, licensing,
    employee relations and other matters incidental to our business.
    We believe that the resolution of these other matters currently
    pending will not individually or in aggregate have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

    quarterly cash dividend program of $0.05 per share, or
    $0.20 per share on an annual basis, on our Class A
    common stock. Approximately $21 million was recorded as a
    reduction to retained earnings during Fiscal 2006 in connection
    with these dividends.

As of June 7, 2006, there were 1,486 holders of record of
    our Class A common stock and 12 holders of record of our

The Company’s initial Class A stock repurchase plan
    was first publicly announced in March 1998, and expired on
    April 1, 2006. An aggregate of approximately
    $81.3 million in share repurchases were made under this
    plan during its term. The Company’s existing repurchase
    plan was first publicly announced on February 2, 2005, and
    provides for the repurchase of up to $100 million of
    Class A Common stock. As of April 1, 2006, no
    repurchases had been made under this plan, which does not have a
    termination date.

OVERVIEW

Our Company is a leader in the design, marketing and
    distribution of premium lifestyle products. Our long-standing
    reputation and distinctive image have been consistently
    developed across an expanding number of products, brands and
    international markets. Our brand names include

Polo

,

Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren
    Black Label, RLX, Ralph Lauren, Blue Label, Lauren, RL, Rugby,
    Chaps, and Club Monaco

, among others.

We classify our interests into three business segments:
    Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. Through those interests, we
    design, license, contract for the manufacture of, market and
    distribute men’s, women’s and children’s apparel,
    accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. Our wholesale
    business consists of wholesale-channel sales principally to
    major department and specialty stores located throughout the
    United States and Europe. Our retail business consists of
    retail-channel sales directly to consumers through wholly owned,
    full-price and factory retail stores located throughout the
    United States, Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, and
    through our jointly


owned retail internet site located at

www.polo.com

. In
    addition, our licensing business consists of royalty-based
    arrangements under which we license the right to third parties
    to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture
    and sale of designated products, such as eyewear and fragrances,
    in specified geographic areas.

Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels
    of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher
    retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends
    result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments
    and key vacation travel and holiday periods in the retail
    segment.

During Fiscal 2006, we reported revenues of $3.746 billion,
    net income of $308 million and net income per diluted share
    of $2.87. This compares to revenues of $3.305 billion, net
    income of $190.4 million and net income per diluted share
    of $1.83 in Fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 operating results include a
    pretax charge of $100 million associated with a litigation
    with one of our former licensees, which has now been settled.

Recent
    Developments

Acquisition
    of Polo Jeans Business

On February 3, 2006, the Company acquired from Jones
    Apparel Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Jones”) all of
    the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun
    Apparel, Inc., the Company’s licensee for men’s and
    women’s casual apparel and sportswear in the United States
    and Canada (the “Polo Jeans Business”). The
    acquisition cost was approximately $260 million, including
    $5 million of transaction costs. The purchase price is
    subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In addition,
    simultaneous with the transaction, the Company settled all
    claims under its litigation with Jones for a cost of
    $100 million (the “Jones-Related Litigation”).

The purchase of the Polo Jeans Business will allow the Company
    to reposition and expand its denim and casual sportswear
    business. In particular, in May 2006, the Company announced that
    it will expand its denim and casual sportswear business by
    introducing new product offerings under the strength of its
    Lauren brand for women and its Polo brand for men. The Company
    will continue to distribute Polo Jeans-branded products
    internationally. The results of operations for the Polo Jeans
    Business have been consolidated in the Company’s results of
    operations commencing February 4, 2006.

Acquisition
    of Footwear Business

On July 15, 2005, the Company acquired from Reebok
    International, Ltd. (“Reebok”) all of the issued and
    outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear
    Co., Inc., the Company’s global licensee for men’s,
    women’s and children’s footwear, as well as certain
    foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok (collectively, the
    “Footwear Business”). The acquisition cost was
    approximately $112 million in cash, including
    $2 million of transaction costs. The results of operations
    for the Footwear Business have been consolidated in the
    Company’s results of operations commencing July 16,
    2005.

Polo
    Trademark Litigation

Since 1999, the Company has been involved in litigation with the
    United States Polo Association, Inc., Jordache, Ltd. and certain
    other entities affiliated with them (collectively, the
    “USPA Group”) in the United States District Court for
    the Southern District of New York over alleged infringements of
    its trademark rights. On October 20, 2005, a jury found
    that one of the four “double horsemen” logos that the
    USPA Group sought to use infringed on the Company’s world
    famous Polo Player Symbol trademark and enjoined its use, but
    did allow the use of the other three trademarks. In November
    2005, the Company filed a motion before the trial court to
    overturn the jury’s decision and hold a new trial with
    respect to the three marks that the jury found not to be
    infringing. The USPA and Jordache have opposed this motion, but
    have not moved to overturn the jury’s decision that the
    fourth double horseman logo did infringe on the Company’s
    trademarks. Pending the judge’s ruling on this motion, it
    is the Company’s position that, the USPA and Jordache
    cannot produce or sell products bearing any of the double
    horseman marks. The Company has preserved its right to appeal if
    the motion is denied. The Company believes that it is premature
    to assess the potential impact on its business resulting from
    the initial adverse ruling. However, the Company believes that
    the quality of its premium lifestyle products and brands will
    continue to drive growth in its operating and financial
    performance notwithstanding the outcome of this matter.


Club
    Monaco Restructuring Plan

During Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded approximately
    $10.8 million of impairment charges to reduce the carrying
    value of fixed assets, primarily relating to its Club Monaco
    retail business, including its Caban Concept and Factory Outlet
    stores. These impairment charges primarily related to

lower-than-expected

store performance.

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company committed
    to a plan to restructure the Company’s Club Monaco retail
    business. In particular, this plan consisted of the closure of
    all five Club Monaco factory outlet stores and the intention to
    dispose of by sale or closure all eight of Club Monaco’s
    Caban Concept stores (collectively, the “Club Monaco
    Restructuring Plan”). In connection with this plan, an
    aggregate restructuring-related charge of $12 million was
    recognized in Fiscal 2006. This charge consisted of (a) a
    $3 million writedown of inventory to estimated net
    realizable value, which has been classified as a component of
    cost of goods sold in the Company’s consolidated statement
    of operations, (b) a $5 million writedown of fixed and
    other net assets, which has been classified as a component of
    restructuring charges in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of operations and (c) the recognition of a
    $4 million liability relating to lease termination costs,
    which has been classified as a component of restructuring
    charges in the Company’s consolidated statement of
    operations. The lease termination costs are expected to be paid
    by the end of 2007.

In addition, the Company expects to recognize an additional
    $2 million restructuring charge during its first quarter of
    Fiscal 2007 relating to Club Monaco’s Caban Concept stores.
    Such costs will be incurred pursuant to the Club Monaco
    Restructuring Plan, but are not recognizable until Fiscal 2007
    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States (“US GAAP”) because the leased space
    was still being used at the end of Fiscal 2006.

See Note 11 to the audited financial statements included
    elsewhere herein for further reference.

Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement

In February 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into
    a new, ten-year exclusive licensing agreement with Luxottica
    Group, S.p.A. and affiliates (“Luxottica”) for the
    design, production and distribution of prescription frames and
    sunglasses under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand (the “Eyewear
    Licensing Agreement”). Luxottica is a global leader in the
    premium and luxury eyewear sector, with over 5,000 optical and
    sun retail stores across the world.

The Eyewear Licensing Agreement is effective on January 1,
    2007 after the Company’s existing licensing agreement with
    another licensee expires. The Company is entitled to receive
    annual minimum royalty and design services payments over the
    life of the contract (the “Minimum Guaranteed
    Payments”). Upon the effective date of the contract, the
    Company will receive a prepayment of approximately
    $200 million in consideration of the Minimum Guaranteed
    Payments to be made by Luxottica. The approximate
    $200 million prepayment is non-refundable, except with
    respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the Company in
    which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment would be
    required to be repaid.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues for Fiscal 2006
    were $3,746.3 million, an increase of $440.9 million,
    compared to net revenues of $3,305.4 million for Fiscal
    2005. Wholesale revenues increased by $230.4 million
    primarily as a result of the sale of newly acquired Footwear and
    Polo Jeans products, the inclusion of a full year of sales by
    our childrenswear business, which was acquired in July 2004 (the
    “Childrenswear Business”), the successful launch of a
    Chaps for women and boys product line and, increased sales in
    our global menswear and womenswear product lines. The increase
    in net revenues also was caused by a $210.0 million revenue
    increase in our retail segment as a result of improved
    comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and
    growth in Polo.com sales. Net revenues for our business segments
    are provided below:

Wholesale net sales

— the net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

the inclusion of $58 million of revenue from the newly
    acquired Footwear Business;

•

the inclusion of $35 million of revenues from the newly
    acquired Polo Jeans Business;

•

a $74 million increase in revenues from our childrenswear
    product line that was acquired in July 2004, including the
    effects from the successful launch of our Chaps for boys product
    line and a one-time benefit of $59 million due to the
    inclusion of a full year of sales;

•

a $73 million aggregate constant-dollar increase in our
    global menswear and womenswear businesses, primarily driven by
    strong growth in our Lauren product line and the effects from
    the successful domestic launch of our Chaps for women product
    line; and

•

a $14 million decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable
    foreign currency effect relating to the strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro during Fiscal 2006.

Retail net sales

— For purposes of the
    discussion of retail operating performance below, we refer to
    the measure “comparable store sales”. Comparable store
    sales refers to the growth of sales in stores that are open for
    at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing
    during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of
    comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either
    relocated or enlarged are also excluded from the calculation of
    comparable store sales until stores have been in their location
    for at least a full fiscal year. Comparable store sales
    information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco
    stores.

The increase in retail net sales primarily reflects:

•

an aggregate $74 million increase in comparable full-price
    and outlet store sales. This increase was driven by a 6.5%
    increase in comparable full-price store sales and a 6.3%
    increase in comparable outlet store sales. Excluding an
    unfavorable $4 million effect on revenues from foreign
    currency exchange rates, comparable full-price store sales
    increased 7.0% and comparable outlet store sales increased 6.6%.

•

a net increase in store count of eleven stores, to a total of
    289 stores, as several new openings (including our new Rugby
    store chain) were offset by the closure of certain Club Monaco
    stores in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006; and

•

a $29 million increase in sales at Polo.com.

Licensing revenues —

Licensing revenues
    were essentially flat, as increased revenue from our
    international licensing business, and the domestic launch of the
    Chaps brand extensions for menswear and accessories offset the
    decreases in product licensing revenue resulting from our Fiscal
    2006 purchase of the Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses (now
    included as part of the Wholesale segment).

Cost of Goods Sold.

Cost of goods sold was
    $1,723.9 million for Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $1,620.9 million for Fiscal 2005. Expressed as a percentage
    of net revenues, cost of goods sold was 46.0% for Fiscal 2006,
    compared to 49.0% for Fiscal 2005. The reduction in cost of
    goods sold as a percentage of net revenues reflected a continued
    focus on sourcing efficiencies and reduced markdown activity as
    a result of better full-price sell-through of our products.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit was
    $2,022.4 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of
    $337.9 million or 20% compared to $1,684.5 for Fiscal 2005.
    This increase reflected higher net sales, improved merchandise
    margins and sourcing efficiencies generally across our wholesale
    and retail businesses.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 54.0%
    in Fiscal 2006 compared to 51.0% in Fiscal 2005. This
    300 basis point increase resulted primarily from the
    factors discussed above and a shift in mix from off-price to
    more full-price sales in our wholesale segment. While we expect
    to continue to realize margin expansion in the future, we expect
    the rate of expansion will be less in Fiscal 2007.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses (“SG&A”) were $1,476.9 million for
    Fiscal 2006, an increase of $99.3 million or 7.2% compared
    to $1,377.6 million in Fiscal 2005.


SG&A expenses in Fiscal 2005 included a $100 million
    charge in connection with the Jones-Related Litigation. On a
    reported basis, SG&A as a percent of net revenues decreased
    to 39.5% from 41.7%. However, excluding the effect from the
    Fiscal 2005 Jones-Related Litigation charge, SG&A as a
    percentage of net revenues increased to 39.5% from 38.7%.
    Excluding the Fiscal 2005 Jones-Related Litigation charge, the
    $199 million increase in SG&A was primarily driven by:

•

higher payroll-related expenses of approximately
    $89 million principally relating to increased selling costs
    associated with higher retail sales and our worldwide retail
    store expansion, higher stock-based compensation charges
    associated with our strong operating performance and increasing
    stock price, and higher investment in infrastructure to support
    the ongoing growth of our businesses;

•

higher brand-related marketing and facilities costs to support
    the ongoing growth of our businesses;

•

higher depreciation costs of approximately $19 million in
    connection with our capital expenditures and global
    expansion; and

•

the inclusion of SG&A costs for our newly acquired Footwear
    and Polo Jeans Businesses, as well as the costs for the
    Childrenswear Business for a full year.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased to $9.1 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $3.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase related to higher
    amortization of intangible assets as part of the Childrenswear
    Business acquired in July 2004, the Footwear Business acquired
    in July 2005 and the Polo Jeans Business acquired in February
    2006.

Impairments of Retail Assets.

Non-cash
    impairment charges of $10.8 million were recognized during
    Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets used in
    certain of our retail stores, largely relating to our Club
    Monaco retail business that includes our Caban Concept and Club
    Monaco Factory Outlet stores. This impairment charge primarily
    related to

lower-than-expected

store performance and preceded the implementation in February
    2006 of a plan to restructure these operations. A
    $1.5 million impairment charge also was recognized in
    Fiscal 2005 relating to Club Monaco retail stores.

Restructuring Charges.

Restructuring charges
    of $9.0 million were recognized in Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $2.3 million in Fiscal 2005. The Fiscal 2006 restructuring
    charge relates to the Club Monaco retail business and includes
    the intended closure of all five Club Monaco outlet stores and
    the intended disposal of all eight of Club Monaco’s Caban
    Concept stores. The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge principally
    related to severance obligations incurred in connection with a
    consolidation of our European operations.

We expect to recognize an additional $2 million
    restructuring charge during the first quarter of Fiscal 2007
    relating to Club Monaco’s Caban Concept stores. Such costs
    will be incurred pursuant to the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan,
    but are not recognizable until Fiscal 2007 in accordance with US
    GAAP because the leased space was still being used at the end of
    Fiscal 2006.


Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    $216.9 million to $516.6 million in Fiscal 2006,
    compared to $299.7 million in Fiscal 2005. Operating income
    for Fiscal 2005 was reduced by the $100 million
    Jones-Related Litigation charge. Operating income for our three
    business segments is provided below:

Wholesale operating income

increased by
    $98.6 million primarily as a result of higher sales and
    improved gross margin rates, partially offset by increases in
    SG&A expenses and higher amortization expenses associated
    with intangible assets recognized in acquisitions.

Retail operating income

increased by $57.2 million
    primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross
    margin rates. These increases were partially offset by an
    increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection
    with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion,
    along with higher retail store impairment charges.

Licensing operating income

decreased by $6.0 million
    primarily due to the loss of royalty income formerly collected
    in connection with the Footwear, Polo Jeans, and Childrenswear
    Businesses, which have now been acquired. This decrease was
    partially offset by improvements in our international licensing
    business.

Unallocated Corporate Expenses

increased by
    $25.3 million primarily as a result of increases in
    brand-related marketing, payroll-related and facilities costs to
    support the ongoing growth of our businesses.

Unallocated Legal and Restructuring
    Charges.

Unallocated legal and restructuring
    charges decreased by $92.4 million in Fiscal 2006. The
    decrease primarily related to the absence in Fiscal 2006 of the
    $100 million Jones-Related Litigation charge recognized in
    Fiscal 2005, offset in part by higher restructuring charges of
    $6.7 million in Fiscal 2006 relating to the Club Monaco
    Restructuring Plan.

Foreign Currency Gains (Losses).

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss
    of $5.7 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to a
    $6.1 million gain during Fiscal 2005. The increased losses
    in Fiscal 2006 primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange
    movements associated with intercompany receivables and payables
    that were not of a long-term investment nature and were settled
    by our international subsidiaries. These gains and losses are
    unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the
    U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased
    to $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $11.0 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase was principally
    related to higher variable rates of interest paid during the
    year under our interest rate swap agreements that were
    subsequently terminated.

Interest Income.

Interest income increased to
    $13.7 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $4.6 million
    in Fiscal 2005. This increase principally related to a higher
    level of excess cash reinvestment and higher interest rates on
    our investments during Fiscal 2006.

Equity in Income of Equity-Method
    Investees.

Equity in the income of equity-method
    investees decreased to $4.3 million in Fiscal 2006,
    compared to $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The decrease
    principally related to higher amortization in Fiscal 2006 of a
    basis difference associated with our 20% investment in Impact21,
    a company that holds the sublicenses for our men’s,
    women’s and jeans business in Japan.


Minority Interest Expense.

Minority interest
    expense increased to $13.5 million in Fiscal 2006, compared
    to $8.0 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase principally
    related to a higher allocation of income to the partners in our
    jointly owned RL Media venture as a result of its improved
    operating performance.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes increased to $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006,
    compared to $107.4 million in Fiscal 2005. This is a result
    of an increase in our effective tax rate to 38.8% in Fiscal 2006
    from 36.1% in Fiscal 2005 as well as the increase in pretax
    income. The increase in our effective tax rate principally
    resulted from the continued growth of our domestic wholesale and
    retail businesses, which led to a higher state tax impact.

Net Income.

Net income increased to
    $308.0 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $190.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The $117.6 million
    increase in net income principally related to the
    $216.9 million increase in operating income previously
    discussed, including the effect of the $100 million
    Jones-Related Litigation charge recognized in Fiscal 2005. These
    benefits were offset in part by $11.8 million of higher
    foreign currency losses and higher taxes of $87.5 million.

Net Income Per Share.

Net income per diluted
    share increased to $2.87 in Fiscal 2006, compared to $1.83 in
    Fiscal 2005. Net income per basic share increased to $2.96 in
    Fiscal 2006, compared to $1.88 in Fiscal 2005. The improvement
    in per share results was due to the higher level of net income
    associated with our underlying operating performance and the
    absence of the $100 million Jones-Related Litigation charge
    recognized in Fiscal 2005, offset in part by higher dilution
    associated with higher average shares outstanding.

Net Revenues.

Net revenues for Fiscal 2005
    were $3,305.4 million, an increase of $655.7 million,
    compared to net revenues of $2,649.7 million for Fiscal
    2004. Wholesale revenues increased by $501.7 million
    primarily as a result of the sale of Lauren and newly acquired
    Childrenswear products. The increase in net revenues was also
    caused by a $178.1 million increase in our retail segment
    as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales,
    continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the
    strengthening Euro. These increases were partially offset by
    decreased sales elsewhere in our wholesale business primarily
    driven by planned reductions in off-price sales in our global
    menswear and womenswear businesses. In addition, the increase in
    revenues was offset in part by lower licensing revenues due to
    the loss of Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues

Wholesale net sales

— the net increase
    primarily reflects:

•

an incremental increase from the Lauren line of
    $280.5 million in the current year due to the inclusion of
    a full year’s sales versus one quarter’s sales in the
    prior year associated with the shift in the Lauren line from a
    licensed business to a consolidated wholesale business;

•

the inclusion of sales from the newly acquired Childrenswear
    line of $180.2 million commencing July 2, 2004;

•

a $51.2 million decrease in the domestic men’s
    wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in
    off-price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned
    reduction of sales to lower margin customers; and

•

increases in the European wholesale business of approximately
    $37.4 million on a constant-dollar basis, as well as a
    $28.4 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in
    the current period.

Retail net sales

— the increase primarily
    reflects:

•

an aggregate $48.7 million increase in comparable
    full-price and outlet store sales. This increase was driven by a
    5.5% increase in comparable full-price store sales and a 3.9%
    increase in comparable outlet store sales. Excluding a favorable
    $10.8 million effect on revenues from foreign currency
    exchange rates and an extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable
    full-price store sales increased 6.1% and comparable outlet
    store sales increased 4.9%.

•

the inclusion of $60.6 million of sales as a result of the
    consolidation of RL Media;

•

worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2005, the Company added
    30 stores and closed 13 stores. Our total store count at
    April 2, 2005 was 278 stores, compared to 261 stores at
    April 3, 2004; and

•

the stronger Euro during Fiscal 2005, which accounted for
    approximately $14.7 million of the increase in net sales.

Licensing revenue

— the net decrease
    primarily reflects:

•

the elimination of $34.6 million of royalties from our
    domestic licensing business due to the acquisition of the
    Childrenswear Business and a full year without royalties from
    the Lauren licensee; and

•

a $13 million increase in international licensing.


Cost of Goods Sold.

Cost of goods sold was
    $1,620.9 million for Fiscal 2005, compared to
    $1,326.4 million for Fiscal 2004. Expressed as a percentage
    of net revenues, cost of goods sold was 49.0% for Fiscal 2005,
    compared to 50.1% for Fiscal 2004. The reduction in cost of
    goods sold as a percentage of net revenues reflected our
    inventory management initiatives and reduced markdown activity.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit was
    $1,684.5 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of
    $361.2 million or 27.3% compared to $1,323.3 million for
    Fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
    increased to 51.0% from 49.9% primarily as a result of improved
    margins in our wholesale and retail businesses driven by reduced
    markdowns and our inventory management initiatives. Partially
    offsetting these improvements is the loss of licensing revenues
    from the Lauren and Childrenswear lines.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

SG&A increased $346.1 million,
    or 33.6%, to $1,377.6 million during Fiscal 2005 from
    $1,031.5 million in Fiscal 2004. SG&A as a percent of
    net revenues increased to 41.7% from 39.0%. The increase in
    SG&A was primarily driven by:

•

legal charges of $100 million recorded in connection with
    Jones-Related Litigation and a charge of $6 million
    recorded in connection with a credit card matter.

•

higher selling salaries and related costs of $85 million,
    on a constant dollar basis, in connection with the increase in
    retail sales and worldwide store expansion.

•

approximately $20 million of the increase in SG&A was
    due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
    fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the
    Euro during Fiscal 2005.

•

expenses of $30 million as a result of the consolidation of
    Ralph Lauren Media.

•

incremental expenses of $22 million associated with a full
    year’s activity in the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive
    of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and
    reduced royalty revenues received.

•

expenses of $38 million associated with the newly acquired
    Childrenswear Business.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
    increased to $3.4 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to
    $1.3 million during Fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from
    amortization of intangible assets as part of the Childrenswear
    Business acquired in July 2004.

Impairments of Retail Assets.

A non-cash
    impairment charge of $1.5 million was recognized during
    Fiscal 2005 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets used in
    certain of our retail stores, largely relating to our Club
    Monaco brand. The impairment charge primarily related to

lower-than-expected

store performance.

Restructuring Charges.

We recorded
    restructuring charges of $2.3 million during Fiscal 2005,
    compared to restructuring charges of $19.6 million during
    Fiscal 2004. The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge is primarily
    comprised of additional contract termination and severance costs
    related to the consolidation of our European business
    operations. The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charges related to a
    restructuring of our European operations, a restructuring of our
    retail operations and the closing of certain RRL retail stores.


Operating Income.

Operating income increased
    $28.8 million, or 10.6%, to $299.7 million in Fiscal
    2005, compared to $270.9 million in Fiscal 2004. Operating
    income for Fiscal 2005 was reduced by the $100 million
    Jones-Related Litigation charge and a $6 million legal
    charge in connection with a credit card matter. Operating income
    for our three business segments is provided below:

%

Wholesale operating income

increased primarily as a
    result of incremental net sales in our newly acquired
    Childrenswear Business and a full year of activity in the Lauren
    business.

Retail operating income

increased primarily as a result
    of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a
    percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially
    offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in
    connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store
    expansion.

Licensing income

decreased primarily due to the loss of
    the Lauren and Childrenswear royalties. This decrease was
    partially offset by improvements in our international licensing
    business.

Unallocated Corporate Expenses

increased primarily as a
    result of increased stock compensation expense and increased
    bonus accruals resulting from our increased operating
    performance.

Unallocated Legal and Restructuring
    Charges.

Unallocated legal and restructuring
    charges increased by $88.9 million in Fiscal 2005. The
    increase primarily related to the $100 million
    Jones-Related Litigation charge and $6 million credit card
    charge recognized in Fiscal 2005, offset in part by lower
    restructuring charges of $17.3 million in Fiscal 2005.

Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses.

The effect of
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain
    of $6.1 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to a
    $1.9 million loss during Fiscal 2004. These gains are
    unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar
    when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are
    translated to U.S. dollars.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased
    to $11.0 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to
    $12.7 million for Fiscal 2004. This decrease was due to the
    repayment of approximately $101 million of short-term
    borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as lower interest rates.

Interest Income.

Interest income increased to
    $4.6 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $2.7 million
    in Fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher average balances of
    invested cash.

Equity in income of equity-method
    investees.

Equity in the income of equity-method
    investees increased to $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005,
    compared to $5.5 million in Fiscal 2004. The increase
    principally related to the improved operating performance of our
    20% investment in Impact21, a company that holds the sublicenses
    for our men’s, women’s and jeans business in Japan.

Minority interest expense.

Minority interest
    expense increased to $8.0 million in Fiscal 2005, compared
    to $1.4 million in Fiscal 2004. The increase principally
    related to the allocation of income to the partners in our
    jointly owned RL Media venture, which was consolidated effective
    as of the end of Fiscal 2004.


Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for
    income taxes increased to $107.4 million in Fiscal 2005,
    compared to $93.9 million in Fiscal 2004. This increase
    related to an increase in our effective tax rate to 36.1% in
    Fiscal 2005 from 35.7% in Fiscal 2004. The increase in our
    effective tax rate principally resulted from the continued
    growth of our domestic wholesale and retail businesses, which
    led to a higher state tax impact.

Net Income.

Net income increased to
    $190.4 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to
    $169.2 million in Fiscal 2004. The $21.2 million
    increase in net income principally related to the increase in
    operating income previously discussed, which was reduced by
    approximately $106 million of litigation-related charges.

Net Income Per Share.

Net income per diluted
    share increased to $1.83 in Fiscal 2005, compared to $1.68 in
    Fiscal 2004. Net income per basic share increased to $1.88 in
    Fiscal 2005, compared to $1.71 in Fiscal 2004. The improvement
    in per share results was due to the higher level of net income
    associated with our underlying operating performance, offset in
    part by higher dilution associated with higher average shares
    outstanding.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Financial
    Condition

At April 1, 2006, the Company had $285.7 million of
    cash and cash equivalents, $280.4 million of debt (net cash
    of $5.3 million, defined as total cash and cash equivalents
    less total debt) and $2,049.6 million of stockholders’
    equity. This compares to $350.5 million of cash and cash
    equivalents, $291.0 million of debt (net cash of
    $59.5 million) and $1,675.7 million of
    stockholders’ equity at April 2, 2005.

The decrease in our net cash position principally related to the
    use of approximately $159 million in cash to fund capital
    expenditures and approximately $480 million of cash
    primarily to fund the Polo Jeans and Footwear transactions.
    These funding requirements more than offset the strong growth in
    the Company’s operating cash flow. The increase in
    stockholders’ equity principally related to the
    Company’s strong earnings growth in Fiscal 2006.

Cash
    Flows

Fiscal
    2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately
    $449 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $382 million in Fiscal 2005. This $67 million increase
    in cash flow was driven primarily by an increase in net income
    and lower working capital requirements, offset, in part, by a
    $100 million payment to settle the Jones-Related Litigation.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was approximately
    $539 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to approximately
    $417 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase in cash used in
    investing activities principally related to acquisition-related
    activities. In Fiscal 2006, the Company used approximately
    $380 million primarily to fund the acquisition of the Polo
    Jeans Business and Footwear Business, whereas in Fiscal 2005,
    the Company used approximately $243 million principally to
    fund the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business. In addition,
    net cash used in investing activities included capital
    expenditures of $159 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $174 million in Fiscal 2005.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.

Net
    cash provided by financing activities was approximately
    $34 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to approximately
    $32 million in Fiscal 2005. The $2 million increase in
    cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to
    the settlement of an interest rate swap agreement and an
    increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock
    options, partially offset by the cost associated with
    repurchases of common stock. The Company repurchased common
    stock under its common stock repurchase program at an aggregate
    cost of approximately $4 million in Fiscal 2006. The
    Company did not repurchase common stock under its common stock
    repurchase program in Fiscal 2005. Proceeds received from the
    exercise of stock options were $55 million in Fiscal 2006,
    compared to $53 million in Fiscal 2005. Cash dividends paid
    were $21 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to
    $22 million in Fiscal 2005.


Fiscal
    2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

Net
    cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $382 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to approximately
    $214 million in Fiscal 2004. This $168 million
    increase in cash flow was driven by an increase in net income
    before the $100 million non-cash, Jones-Related Litigation
    charge and $102 million of non-cash, depreciation and
    amortization expense, offset in part by higher working capital
    requirements.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.

Net
    cash used in investing activities was approximately
    $417 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to approximately
    $135 million in Fiscal 2004. The increase of cash used in
    investing activities principally related to acquisition-related
    spending of $243 million in Fiscal 2005, which was
    substantially utilized in connection with the purchase of the
    Childrenswear Business. In addition, capital expenditures
    increased to $174 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to
    $126 million in Fiscal 2004.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.

Net
    cash provided by financing activities was approximately
    $32 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to approximately
    $76 million of cash used in Fiscal 2004. Cash provided by
    financing activities during Fiscal 2005, consisted of the
    payment of $22 million in dividends, offset by proceeds of
    $53 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used
    by financing activities during Fiscal 2004 primarily consisted
    of the net repayment of short-term borrowings of approximately
    $101 million and the payment of $15 million in
    dividends, partially offset by $39 million of proceeds from
    the exercise of stock options.

Liquidity

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are the cash
    flow generated from its operations, which includes the
    approximate $200 million to be received in January 2007
    under its new Eyewear Licensing Agreement, $450 million of
    availability under its credit facility, available cash and
    equivalents and other potential sources of financial capacity
    relating to its under-leveraged capital structure. These sources
    of liquidity are needed to fund the Company’s ongoing cash
    requirements, including working capital requirements, retail
    store expansion, construction and renovation of
    shop-within-shops, investment in technological infrastructure,
    acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment, stock repurchases and
    other corporate activities. Management believes that the
    Company’s existing resources of cash will be sufficient to
    support its operating and capital requirements for the
    foreseeable future.

As discussed below under the section entitled “Debt and
    Covenant Compliance,” the Company had no borrowings under
    its credit facility as of April 1, 2006. However, in the
    event of a material acquisition, settlement of a material
    contingency or a material adverse business development, the
    Company may need to draw on its credit facility or other
    potential sources of financing. Also, as discussed below, the
    Company currently intends to refinance its Euro debt obligations
    that mature in November 2006 during the first half of Fiscal
    2007, subject to prevailing market conditions and its ability to
    refinance such debt obligations on acceptable terms.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

The Company currently has a common stock repurchase program that
    allows it to repurchase, from time to time, up to
    $100 million of Class A common stock. Share
    repurchases are subject to overall business and market
    conditions. The Company also had a pre-existing common stock
    repurchase program that expired at the end of Fiscal 2006. Under
    that pre-existing program, the Company repurchased 69.3 thousand
    shares of Class A common stock in Fiscal 2006 at a cost of
    approximately $4 million. No shares of Class A common
    stock were repurchased in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004.

Dividends

The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly
    dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision
    to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
    discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will
    depend on, among other things, the Company’s results of
    operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other
    factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.


The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per
    outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal
    2005. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was
    $21 million in Fiscal 2006, $22 million in Fiscal 2005
    and $15 million in Fiscal 2004.

Debt
    and Covenant Compliance

Euro
    Debt

The Company has outstanding approximately €227 million
    principal amount of 6.125% notes that are due in November
    2006 (the “Euro Debt”). The carrying value of the Euro
    Debt changes as a result of changes in Euro exchange rates and
    changes in its fair value associated with an interest-rate swap
    agreement that had been used until its termination in March 2006
    as an effective hedge against changes in the fair value of the
    Euro Debt.

As of April 2, 2006, the carrying value of the Euro Debt
    was $280.4 million, compared to $291.0 million at
    April 2, 2005. The Company has the option to redeem the
    Euro Debt at any time prior to its scheduled maturity. The
    Company currently intends to refinance the Euro Debt during the
    first half of Fiscal 2007, subject to prevailing market
    conditions and its ability to refinance such debt obligations on
    acceptable terms.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

The Company has a credit facility (the “Credit
    Facility”) that currently provides for a $450 million
    revolving line of credit, which can be increased to up to
    $525 million if one or more new or existing lenders under
    the facility agree to increase their commitments. The credit
    facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of April 1, 2006, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility, but the Company was
    contingently liable for $46 million of outstanding letters
    of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase commitments).

The Credit Facility expires on October 6, 2009. There are
    no mandatory reductions in borrowing availability throughout its
    term.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate
    equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Company’s
    option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of
    JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time and
    (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal funds rate (as
    published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) plus 50 basis
    points or (b) a LIBOR rate in effect from time to time, as
    adjusted for the Federal Reserve Board’s Euro currency
    liabilities maximum reserve percentage. The applicable margin
    was 62.5 basis points as of the end of Fiscal 2006 and is
    subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit ratings
    at the time of any borrowings.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    was 15 basis points as of the end of Fiscal 2006, and is
    subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exemptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the
    Company to maintain certain financial covenants, consisting of
    (i) a minimum ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
    Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (“EBITDAR”) to the
    sum of Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Lease
    Expense and (ii) a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to
    EBITDAR, as such terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of
    April 1, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all
    covenants under the Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenants described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an event of
    default will occur if


Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, and related entities fail to maintain a
    specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the
    Company’s common stock.

The following table summarizes certain of the Company’s
    aggregate contractual obligations at April 1, 2006, and the
    estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected
    to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flow in future
    periods. The Company expects to fund the firm commitments with
    operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business
    and, if necessary, availability under its $450 million
    credit facility or other potential sources of financing.

    Information has been presented separately for operating and
    capital leases. In addition to such amounts, the Company is
    normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs
    relating to its leased real estate properties.

Refer to Note 15 to the audited financial statements
    included elsewhere herein for a description of the
    Company’s contingent commitments, primarily letters of
    credit, not included in the above table.

MARKET
    RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates relating to both the cash flows generated by its
    international operations and the fair value of its international
    operations, as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of
    its fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments
    to manage such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative
    transactions for speculative purposes. The following is a
    summary of the Company’s risk management strategies and the
    effect of those strategies on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as
    hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce its
    risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases and
    intercompany royalty payments. As part of its overall strategy
    to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily exposure to changes in the
    value of the Euro and Yen, the Company hedges a portion of its


foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing
    twelve-month to two year period. In doing so, the Company uses
    foreign exchange contracts that generally have maturities of
    three months to two years to provide continuing coverage
    throughout the hedging period.

At April 1, 2006, the Company had contracts for the sale of
    $90 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these
    $90 million of sales contracts, $22 million were for
    the sale of Euros and $68 million were for the sale of
    Japanese Yen. The fair value of the forward contracts was an
    unrealized loss of $2 million. At April 2, 2005, the
    Company had contracts for the sale of $224 million of
    foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these $224 million of
    sales contracts, $124 million were for the sale of Euros
    and $100 million were for the sale of Japanese Yen. The
    fair value of the forward contracts was an unrealized loss of
    $7 million.

The Company records foreign currency exchange contracts at fair
    value in its balance sheets and designated these derivative
    instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB
    Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and subsequent
    amendments (“FAS 133”). As such, the related
    gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are then
    either recognized in income in the period in which the related
    royalties being hedged are received, or in the case of inventory
    purchases, recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being
    hedged when sold. However, to the extent that any of these
    foreign currency exchange contracts are not considered to be
    100% effective in offsetting the change in the value of the
    royalties or inventory purchases being hedged, any changes in
    fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these
    contracts is immediately recognized in income. No significant
    gains or losses relating to ineffective hedges were recognized
    in any period.

The Company had deferred net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in the amount of approximately $1 million at the
    end of Fiscal 2006, less than half of which is expected to be
    recognized in earnings in Fiscal 2007. Net losses on foreign
    currency exchange contracts in the amount of approximately
    $6 million were deferred at the end of Fiscal 2005. The
    Company recognized net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in earnings of $5 million for Fiscal 2006 and
    $11 million for Fiscal 2005.

Based on the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at
    April 1, 2006, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as
    compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for
    currencies under contract at April 1, 2006 would result in
    approximately $9 million of net unrealized losses.
    Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would
    result in approximately $9 million of net unrealized gains.
    Because the foreign currency exchange contracts are designated
    as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized
    loss or gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation
    would be largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged
    items.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company has outstanding approximately
    €227.0 million principal amount of Euro Debt. The
    entire principal amount of the Euro Debt has been designated as
    a fair-value hedge of the Company’s net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries in accordance with
    FAS 133. As required by FAS 133, the changes in fair
    value of a derivative instrument that is designated as, and is
    effective as, an economic hedge of the net investment in a
    foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a
    translation adjustment under FASB Statement No. 52,
    “Foreign Currency Translation,” to the extent it is
    effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the
    Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate are
    reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded
    gains (losses) in stockholders’ equity on the translation
    of the Euro Debt to U.S. dollars in the amount of
    approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2006, $(18) million for
    Fiscal 2005 and $(31) million for Fiscal 2004.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

Historically, the Company has used floating-rate interest rate
    swap agreements to hedge changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate Euro Debt. These interest rate swap agreements, which
    effectively converted fixed interest rate payments on the
    Company’s Euro Debt to a floating-rate basis, were
    designated as a fair value hedge in accordance with
    FAS 133. The Company had interest rate swap agreements on
    the amount of approximately


€205 million notional amount of indebtness as of the
    end of Fiscal 2005, but all of such swap agreements were
    terminated in March 2006. No other interest rate swap agreements
    were held as of the end of Fiscal 2006.

As a fair value hedge, the Company records interest rate swap
    agreements at fair value in its balance sheet. Changes in fair
    value of the interest rate swap agreements are offset in
    earnings against changes in the fair value of the underlying
    portion of the Euro Debt being hedged. In accordance with
    FAS 133, the Company has assumed no hedge ineffectiveness
    as the terms of the interest rate swaps mirrored the terms of
    the Euro debt.

In connection with the termination of these interest rate swap
    agreements in Fiscal 2006, the Company received a net settlement
    of approximately $5 million. Such amount has been reflected
    as an increase in the carrying value of the Euro Debt and will
    be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense (similar to
    the accounting for a debt premium) over the remaining maturity
    of the Euro Debt.

At April 1, 2006, the Company had no variable-rate debt
    outstanding. As such, the Company’s exposure to changes in
    interest rates primarily related to its fixed-rate Euro Debt. At
    April 1, 2006, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was
    $280.4 million and the fair value was $279.9 million.
    A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of
    interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the
    fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $0.4 million.
    Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain
    simplifying assumptions, including no changes in euro currency
    exchange rates and an immediate

across-the-board

increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no
    other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 60,
    “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
    Accounting Policies” (“FRR 60”), suggests
    companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those
    accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers
    an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the
    Company’s financial condition and results, and requires
    significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in
    its application. The Company believes that the following list
    represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by
    FRR 60. For a summary of all of the Company’s significant
    accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the audited
    financial statements included elsewhere herein.

Sales
    Allowances and Uncollectible Accounts

A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and
    net income is estimating the portion of revenues and related
    receivables that are not realizable. In particular, wholesale
    revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue,
    including

e-commerce

sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns.

In determining estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks, management
    analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic
    and market conditions and retailer performance. The Company
    reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The
    Company’s historical estimates of these costs have not
    differed materially from actual results.

Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to
    determine if they will ultimately be collected. In performing
    this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are
    included, including an analysis of specific risks on a

customer-by-customer

basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging
    analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has
    historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this
    information, management provides a reserve for the estimated
    amounts believed to be uncollectible.

See “Accounts Receivable” under Note 3 to the
    audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for an
    analysis of the activity in the Company’s reserves for
    sales allowances and uncollectible accounts for each of the
    three fiscal years ended April 1, 2006.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its


own stores directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail
    inventories are stated at lower of cost or estimated realizable
    value. Cost for wholesale inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories assessing slow-turning, ongoing product, as well as
    all fashion product. Estimated realizable value of distressed
    inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for
    this category of inventory of the Company’s individual
    product lines, the impact of market trends and economic
    conditions, and the value of current orders in-house relating to
    the future sales of this type of inventory. Estimates may differ
    from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products
    in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market
    conditions. The Company’s historical estimates of these
    costs and its provisions have not differed materially from
    actual results.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes” (“FAS 109”). Under this
    method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets, deferred tax
    liabilities, taxes currently payable/ refunds receivable and tax
    expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in
    the current year and include the results of any difference
    between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes
    reflect the tax effect of any net operating loss, capital loss
    and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax
    effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of
    assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax
    purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The
    financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted
    for in the period of enactment.

Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide
    provision for income taxes. That is, in the ordinary course of a
    global business, there are many transactions for which the
    ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is the Company’s
    policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable
    in future years as a result of an examination by tax
    authorities. The Company establishes those reserves based upon
    management’s assessment of the exposure associated with
    permanent tax differences and tax credits. In addition,
    valuation allowances are established when management determines
    that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax reserves and
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
    to those balances.

Purchase
    Accounting

The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the
    purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of
    acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on
    their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the
    purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets
    acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires
    management’s judgment and often involves the use of
    significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions
    with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount
    rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items.

In addition, in connection with its recent business
    acquisitions, the Company has settled certain pre-existing
    relationships. These pre-existing relationships include
    licensing agreements and litigation in the case of the
    acquisition of the Polo Jeans Business. In accordance with

EITF 04-1,

“Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the
    Parties to a Business Combination,” the Company is required
    to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these
    transactions between the value of the business acquired and the
    value of the settlement of the pre-existing relationship in
    proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the
    terms of the pre-existing relationship were determined to not be
    reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be
    recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is
    required to determine the respective fair values of the business
    acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre-existing
    relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent
    valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
    (“FAS 142”). Under FAS 142, goodwill,
    including any goodwill


included in the carrying value of investments accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting, and certain other
    intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not
    amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on
    comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying
    values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their
    respective useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets
    are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying
    amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement
    No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”).

In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is
    determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
    impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with
    its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If
    the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
    goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired
    and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If
    the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
    measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step
    of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value
    of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount
    of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
    goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
    the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
    business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting
    unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that
    unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the
    reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
    the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid
    to acquire the reporting unit.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first
    step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair
    value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit
    (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step
    of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and
    often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
    Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the
    fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
    impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any
    such charge. To assist in the process of determining goodwill
    impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from independent
    valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily
    determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and
    recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates
    and assumptions, including projected future cash flows
    (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent
    in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination
    of appropriate market comparables.

The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
    asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
    In addition, in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for
    recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future
    cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and
    eventual disposition in accordance with FAS 144. To the
    extent the estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows
    attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted
    cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between
    the carrying value of such asset and its fair value.

There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with
    the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other
    intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years ended
    April 1, 2006.

Impairment
    of Other Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with FAS 144, the recoverability of the
    carrying values of other long-lived assets, such as property and
    equipment, is evaluated whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that such values may be impaired. In
    evaluating a long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company
    uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the
    extent that estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows
    attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted
    cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between
    the carrying


value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of
    and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, whether
    through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of
    carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various
    factors into account, including changes in merchandising
    strategy, the impact of more experienced retail store managers,
    the impact of increased local advertising and the emphasis on
    retail store cost controls. Since the determination of future
    cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be
    future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not
    meet expectations.

The Company recognized impairment charges on retail fixed assets
    in the amounts of approximately $11 million for Fiscal 2006
    and $2 million for Fiscal 2005. No impairment charges were
    recognized in Fiscal 2004.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other
    procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
    issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time period specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
    Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
    files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated
    to the issuer’s management, including its principal
    executive and principal financial officers, or persons
    performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal
    year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation,
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were not effective as of the fiscal year end covered
    by this annual report due to the tax-related material weakness
    in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    described below in management’s report on internal control
    over financial reporting.

(b) Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in Securities Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and preparation of financial statements for external
    purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on
    the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this
    evaluation, management concluded that, as of April 1, 2006,
    the Company did not maintain effective internal control over
    financial reporting as there was more than a remote likelihood
    that a


material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim
    financial statements with respect to income taxes would not be
    prevented or detected, on a timely basis, by Company employees
    in the normal course of performing their assigned functions.

This control deficiency, which management first determined to be
    a material weakness under the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board’s Auditing Standard No. 2 in its
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2005, largely related to
    inadequate internal tax resources for a sufficient period of
    time, lack of formal training for tax personnel and inadequate
    controls and procedures over the tax accounting process to
    complete a comprehensive and timely review of the income tax
    accounts and required tax footnote disclosures. Because this
    material weakness was not fully remediated as of the end of
    Fiscal 2006, our management believes that, as of April 1,
    2006, we did not maintain effective internal control over
    financial reporting based on the COSO criteria.

The Company’s assessment of its internal control over
    financial reporting did not include an evaluation of the
    internal controls of its Footwear Business and Polo Jeans
    Business, which were acquired during Fiscal 2006. Accordingly,
    the Company’s conclusion regarding the effectiveness of its
    internal controls over financial reporting does not extend to
    the internal controls of such businesses. In the aggregate, the
    Footwear Business and Polo Jeans Business represented 14.7% of
    the total consolidated assets, 2.6% of total consolidated
    revenues and 1.5% of total consolidated operating income of the
    Company as of and for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2006.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting as of April 1, 2006 was
    audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,
    which is included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

(c) Changes in internal controls over financial
    reporting

Financial
    Closing and Reporting Process

In the Company’s Quarterly Report on

Form 10-Q

for the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2005, management
    reported that it had identified a material weakness in its
    financial closing and reporting process. This material weakness
    was attributable to an inadequate number of accounting personnel
    with sufficient training. The accounting resource issue
    contributed to (i) an inadequate review and analysis of
    select account balances and (ii) the lack of resolution of
    unusual or reconciling items in a timely manner.

Since that time, the Company has taken steps to remediate the
    material weakness noted in its financial closing and reporting
    process. These steps included, but were not limited to,
    (i) the hiring of a new Vice President and Corporate
    Controller in September 2005, (ii) the upgrade and
    expansion of technical accounting resources in the Corporate
    financial closing and reporting group, along with its divisions,
    (iii) improved internal training, development and
    communication of accounting standards across the Company and
    (iv) improved quarterly review procedures. Accordingly,
    since these controls were in place for a sufficient period of
    time and the operating effectiveness of internal controls over
    the financial closing and reporting process was tested during
    the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, management believes that the
    material weakness in the financial closing and reporting process
    identified earlier in the year was remediated as of
    April 1, 2006.

Income
    Tax Accounting Process

In its assessment of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2005, management
    reported that it had identified a material weakness in its
    income tax accounting process in accordance with the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board’s Auditing Standard
    No. 2. Management’s remediation plan, which was
    implemented in Fiscal 2006, included (i) the upgrade and
    expansion of internal tax staff with appropriate qualifications
    and training in accounting for income taxes,
    (ii) instituting formal training of tax personnel,
    (iii) reviewing income tax accounting processes and
    implementing changes, including technology enhancements, in
    order to strengthen the design and operation in internal
    controls and (iv) developing and implementing policies to
    ensure that all significant tax accounts are properly reconciled
    on a timely basis and that all tax calculations supporting the
    amounts reflected in our financial statements are accurate.


During Fiscal 2006, the Company made progress in its remediation
    efforts. In particular, the Company hired a new Vice President
    of Taxes in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006 and reorganized the
    tax department later in the year. The reorganization led to the
    addition of seven new tax professionals, substantially all of
    whom joined the Company during the fourth quarter of Fiscal
    2006. With the new tax team assembled, the Company conducted a
    review of its income tax accounting processes and identified
    additional areas for process improvement and strengthening of
    controls.

Although certain improvements and controls were implemented, the
    delay in upgrading tax resources related to competitive market
    conditions for the recruitment of tax accounting talent impeded
    the Company’s efforts to fully execute its tax remediation
    plan. As such, management concluded that its planned improved
    controls over tax accounting either had not been completely
    implemented or had not been operating effectively for a
    sufficient period of time in order to reduce the likelihood to
    remote that a material misstatement in its income tax accounts
    would occur. The Company intends to continue to implement
    process and system improvements, policies and stronger controls
    over tax accounting in Fiscal 2007 in accordance with its
    remediation plan.

Except for the matters described above, there were no changes
    during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.

Basis of
    Presentation

Basis
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
    Company and all entities in which the Company has a controlling
    voting interest. The consolidated financial statements also
    include the accounts of any variable interest entities in which
    the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary and such
    entities are required to be consolidated in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“US GAAP”). In particular, pursuant to the provisions
    of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 46R (“FIN 46R”), the
    Company consolidates (a) Polo Ralph Lauren Japan
    Corporation (“PRL Japan”, formerly known as New Polo
    Japan, Inc.), a 50% -owned venture, and (b) Ralph Lauren
    Media, LLC (“RL Media”), a 50%-owned venture with NBC
    Universal, Inc. and an affiliated company (collectively,
    “NBC”). RL Media conducts the Company’s

e-commerce

initiatives through a jointly owned internet site known as
    Polo.com.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to
    March 31. As such, all references to “Fiscal
    2006” represent the

52-week

fiscal year ending April 1, 2006, references to
    “Fiscal 2005” represent the

52-week

fiscal year ended April 2, 2005 and references to
    “Fiscal 2004” represent the

53-week

fiscal year ended April 3, 2004.

The financial position and operating results of the
    Company’s consolidated 50% interest in PRL Japan are
    reported on a one-month lag. Similarly, prior to the fourth
    quarter of Fiscal 2006, the financial position and operating
    results of RL Media were reported on a three-month lag. During
    the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, RL Media changed its fiscal
    year, which was formerly on a calendar-year basis, to conform
    with the Company’s fiscal-year basis. In connection with
    this change, the three-month reporting lag for RL Media was
    eliminated. Accordingly, the Company’s operating results
    for Fiscal 2006 include the operating results of RL Media for
    the

52-week

consecutive period ended April 1, 2006. The net effect from
    this change in RL Media’s fiscal year was not material and
    has been reflected in retained earnings as a component of
    stockholders’ equity.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include reserves
    for customer returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks; reserves for
    the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation matters;
    impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; useful
    lives to determine depreciation and amortization expense;
    accounting for income taxes; the valuation of stock-based
    compensation; and accounting for business combinations under the
    purchase method of accounting.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    periods’ financial information in order to conform to the
    current period’s presentation.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue within the Company’s wholesale segment is
    recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of
    estimates of returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks. Returns and
    allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts
    are based on trade terms. Estimates for

end-of-season

markdown allowances are based on historical trends, seasonal
    results, an evaluation of current economic and market
    conditions, and retailer performance. The Company reviews and
    refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s
    historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially
    from actual results.

Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at
    the time of sale to consumers.

E-commerce

revenue from sales of products ordered through the
    Company’s jointly owned retail internet site known as
    Polo.com is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment
    by our customers. Such revenue also is reduced by an estimate of
    returns.

Licensing revenue is initially recognized based upon the higher
    of (a) contractually guaranteed minimum royalty levels and
    (b) estimates of actual sales and royalty data received
    from our licensees.

Cost
    of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and
    produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in,
    import costs, as well as reserves for shrinkage and inventory
    obsolescence. The costs of selling merchandise, including
    preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing,
    warehousing and order charges, are included in selling, general
    and administrative expenses (“SG&A”).

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

The costs associated with shipping goods to customers are
    reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and
    handling costs incurred approximated $91 million,
    $70 million and $61 million in Fiscal 2006, Fiscal
    2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. Shipping and handling
    charges billed to customers are included in revenues.

Advertising
    Costs

In accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 93-7,

“Reporting on Advertising Costs,” advertising costs,
    including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed upon
    the first time that the advertisement is exhibited. Costs of

out-of-store

advertising paid to wholesale customers under cooperative
    advertising programs are expensed as an advertising cost if both
    the identified advertising benefit is sufficiently separable
    from the purchase of the Company’s products by customers
    and the fair value of such benefit is measurable. Costs of
    in-store advertising paid to wholesale customers under
    cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising
    costs, but are reflected as a reduction of revenues since the
    benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of
    the Company’s products by customers.

Advertising expense amounted to approximately $166 million
    for Fiscal 2006, $127 million for Fiscal 2005 and
    $112 million for Fiscal 2004. Deferred advertising costs,
    which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet
    been exhibited or services that have not yet been received, were
    approximately $4 million and $5 million at the end of
    Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and operating results of foreign
    operations are primarily consolidated using the local currency
    as the functional currency. Local currency assets and
    liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the
    balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are
    translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
    Resulting translation gains or loses are included in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity
    as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    Gains and losses on translation of intercompany loans with
    foreign subsidiaries of a long-term investment nature also are
    included in this component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company also recognizes gains and losses on foreign currency
    transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the
    foreign entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses also include amounts realized on
    the settlement of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries
    that are either short term or were previously of a long-term
    investment nature and deferred as a component of
    stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
    and losses are recognized in earnings and are separately
    disclosed in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders’
    equity, consists of net income (loss) and other gains and losses
    affecting equity that, under US GAAP, are excluded from net
    income (loss). The components of other comprehensive income
    (loss) for the Company primarily consist of foreign currency
    translation gains and losses and deferred gains and losses on
    hedging instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts
    and changes in the fair value of the Company’s
    Euro-denominated debt issuance that is designated as a hedge of
    the fair value of the Company’s net investment in certain
    of its European subsidiaries.

Net
    Income Per Common Share

Net income per common share is determined in accordance with
    FASB Statement No. 128, “Earnings per Share”
    (“FAS 128”). Under the provisions of
    FAS 128, basic net income per common share is computed by
    dividing the net income applicable to common shares after
    preferred dividend requirements, if any, by the weighted average
    of common shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average
    common shares include shares of the Company’s Class A
    and Class B Common Stock. Diluted net income per common
    share adjusts basic net income per common share for the effects
    of outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and any other

F-8

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

potentially dilutive financial instruments, only in the periods
    in which such effect is dilutive under the treasury stock method.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to
    calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to
    those shares used in calculating diluted net income per common
    share as follows:

Options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
    greater than the average market price of the common stock are
    anti-dilutive and, therefore, not included in the computation of
    diluted net income per common share. In addition, the Company
    has outstanding performance-based restricted stock units that
    are issuable only upon the satisfaction of certain performance
    goals. Such units only are included in the computation of
    diluted shares to the extent the underlying performance
    conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the reporting
    period. As of April 1, 2006, there was an aggregate of 765
    thousand additional shares issuable upon the exercise of
    anti-dilutive options and the vesting of performance-based
    restricted stock units that were excluded from the diluted share
    calculation.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Through the end of Fiscal 2006, the Company used the intrinsic
    value method to account for stock-based compensation in
    accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” (“APB 25”) and had adopted the
    disclosure-only provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended
    by FASB Statement No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”
    (“FAS 123”). Accordingly, no compensation cost
    has been recognized for fixed stock option grants. Had
    compensation costs for the Company’s stock option grants
    been determined

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less, including
    investments in debt securities. Investments in debt securities
    are diversified among high-credit quality securities in
    accordance with our risk-management policies, and primarily
    include commercial paper and money market funds.

Accounts
    Receivable

In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to
    customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts
    receivable, net, as shown in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets, is net of certain reserves and allowances. These
    reserves and allowances consist of (a) reserves for
    returns, discounts,

end-of-season

markdown allowances and operational chargebacks and
    (b) allowances for doubtful accounts. These reserves and
    allowances are discussed in further detail below.

A reserve for trade discounts is determined based on open
    invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers,
    and is treated as a reduction of revenue.

Estimated

end-of-season

markdown allowances are included as a reduction of revenue.
    These provisions are based on retail sales performance, seasonal
    negotiations with customers, historical deduction trends and an
    evaluation of current market conditions.

A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various
    deductions by customers relating to individual shipments. This
    reserve, net of expected recoveries, is included as a reduction
    of revenue. The reserve is based on chargebacks received as of
    the date of the financial statements and past experience. Costs
    associated with potential returns of products also are included
    as a reduction of revenues. These return reserves are based on
    current

information regarding retail performance, historical experience

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

In the wholesale business, the Company has three key
    department-store customers that generate significant sales
    volume. For Fiscal 2006, each of these customers contributed a
    range of 15% to 18% of all wholesale revenues, and approximately
    50% in the aggregate.

Inventories

The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale
    distribution channels to major department stores and specialty
    retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also
    holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly
    to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at
    lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale
    inventories is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and cost for retail
    inventories is determined on a moving-average cost basis.

The Company continually evaluates the composition of its
    inventories assessing slow-turning, ongoing (specially made for
    Retail) product, as well as all fashion product. Estimated
    realizable value of distressed inventory is determined based on
    historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the
    Company’s individual product lines, the impact of market
    trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders
    in-house relating to the future sales of this type of inventory.
    Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity,
    quality

F-11

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer
    preferences and market conditions. The Company’s historical
    estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed
    materially from actual results.

Investments

Investments in companies in which the Company has significant
    influence, but less than a controlling voting interest, are
    accounted for using the equity method. This is generally
    presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of
    the investee. However, as a matter of policy, if the Company had
    a greater than 50% ownership interest in an investee and the
    minority shareholders held certain rights that allowed them to
    participate in the

day-to-day

operations of the business, the Company would also use the
    equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, only the Company’s investment in
    and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in
    the consolidated balance sheet; only the Company’s share of
    the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in the
    consolidated operating results; and only the dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the investee,
    additional cash investments, loan repayments or other cash paid
    to the investee are included in the consolidated cash flows.

Investments in companies in which the Company does not have a
    controlling interest, or is unable to exert significant
    influence, are accounted for at market value if the investments
    are publicly traded and there are no resale restrictions greater
    than one year

(“available-for-sale

investments”). If there are resale restrictions greater
    than one year, or if the investment is not publicly traded, then
    the investment is accounted for at cost.

The Company’s only significant investment is a 20% equity
    interest in Impact21 Co., Ltd. (“Impact21”). Impact21
    is a public company and holds the sublicenses for the
    Company’s men’s, women’s and jeans businesses in
    Japan. The Company accounts for its interest in Impact21 using
    the equity method of accounting, which is included in other
    assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable
    assets. As of the end of Fiscal 2006, estimated useful lives
    were periods of up to seven years for furniture, fixtures,
    computer systems and equipment; periods for up to ten years for
    machinery and equipment; and periods of up to forty years for
    buildings and building improvements. Leasehold improvements are
    depreciated over periods equal to the shorter of the estimated
    useful lives of the assets and the life of the lease.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in
    accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
    (“FAS 142”). Under FAS 142, goodwill,
    including any goodwill included in the carrying value of
    investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting,
    and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment
    at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair
    values to their carrying values. Finite-lived intangible assets
    are amortized over their respective useful lives and, along with
    other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment
    periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“FAS 144”).

In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, including
    finite-lived intangibles and property and equipment, the Company
    uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and eventual disposition in accordance
    with FAS 144. To the extent that estimated future,
    undiscounted cash inflows attributable to the asset, less
    estimated future, undiscounted cash outflows, are less than the
    carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
    equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset
    and its

F-12

    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a
    committed plan of disposal, whether through sale or abandonment,
    are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less
    costs to sell.

Officers’
    Life Insurance

The Company maintains several whole-life and a few split-dollar
    life insurance policies for its senior executives. Whole life
    policies are recorded at their cash-surrender value in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Split-dollar policies
    are recorded at the lesser of their cash-surrender value or
    premiums paid to date. As of the end of Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal
    2005, amounts classified in other assets in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets relating to officers’ life
    insurance policies were $52 million and $51 million,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method
    prescribed by FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes” (“FAS 109”). Under this
    method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets, deferred tax
    liabilities, taxes currently payable/ refunds receivable and tax
    expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in
    the current year and include the results of any difference
    between US GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect
    the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and
    general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of
    temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and
    liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as
    determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The financial
    effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the
    period of enactment.

Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide
    provision for income taxes. That is, in the ordinary course of a
    global business, there are many transactions for which the
    ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is the Company’s
    policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable
    in future years as a result of an examination by tax
    authorities. The Company establishes those reserves based upon
    management’s assessment of the exposure associated with
    permanent tax differences and tax credits. In addition,
    valuation allowances are established when management determines
    that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax reserves and
    valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as
    events occur or circumstances change that warrant adjustments to
    those balances.

Deferred
    Rent Obligations

Rent expense under noncancelable operating leases with scheduled
    rent increases and landlord incentives are accounted for on a
    straight-line basis over the lease term beginning with the
    effective lease commencement date. The excess of straight-line
    rent expense over scheduled payment amounts and landlord
    incentives is recorded as a deferred liability. As of the end of
    Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, unamortized deferred rent
    obligations classified in other non-current liabilities in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets were approximately
    $85 million and $74 million, respectively.

Derivatives
    and Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance
    with FASB Statement No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and
    subsequent amendments (collectively, “FAS 133”).
    FAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition,
    FAS 133 provides that, for derivative instruments that
    qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are
    either (a) offset against the changes in fair value of the
    hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings
    or (b) recognized in stockholders’ equity until the
    hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the
    derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash
    flows. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in
    fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments
    approximates fair value, except for certain differences relating
    to fixed-rate debt, investments in other entities accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting and other financial
    instruments. However, other than differences in the fair value
    of fixed-rate debt as disclosed in Note 13, these
    differences were not significant at April 1, 2006 and
    April 2, 2005. The fair value of financial instruments
    generally is determined by reference to market values resulting
    from trading on a national securities exchange or an

over-the-counter

market. In cases where quoted market prices are not available,
    fair value is based on estimates using present value or other
    valuation techniques.

For cash flow reporting purposes, the Company classifies
    proceeds received or paid upon the settlement of a derivative
    financial instrument in the same manner as the item being hedged.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R and, in March
    2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
    (“SAB 107”). SAB 107 provides implementation
    guidance for companies to use in their adoption of
    FAS 123R. FAS 123R supersedes both APB 25, which
    permitted the use of the intrinsic-value method in accounting
    for stock-based compensation, and FAS 123, which allowed
    companies applying APB 25 to just disclose in their
    financial statements the pro forma effect on net income from
    applying the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based
    compensation.

Under FAS 123R, all forms of share-based payments to
    employees, including stock options, would be treated as
    compensation and recognized in the statement of operations based
    on their fair value at the date of grant for awards that
    actually vest. This standard is effective for awards granted,
    modified or settled by the Company beginning on April 2,
    2006. The Company has historically accounted for stock-based
    compensation under APB 25 and has adopted FAS 123R
    effective as of Fiscal 2007 under the modified prospective
    transition method.

The adoption of FAS 123R is expected to have a significant
    future impact on the Company’s reported net income and
    earnings per share. See “Stock-Based Compensation”
    under Note 3 for the pro forma impact of applying the
    fair-value method of accounting for all stock-based compensation
    awards in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123.

Other
    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
    (“FAS 154”). FAS 154 generally requires that
    accounting changes and errors be applied retrospectively.
    FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections
    of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2005. The Company does not expect FAS 154 to have a
    material impact on its financial statements.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”
    (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 provides clarification
    regarding the timing of liability recognition for legal
    obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible
    long-lived asset when the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditioned on a future event. The
    Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 during Fiscal
    2006. The application of FIN 47 did not have a material
    effect on the Company’s financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs” (“FAS 151”).
    FAS 151 clarifies standards for the treatment of abnormal
    amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
    spoilage. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect
    FAS 151 to have a material effect on its financial
    statements.

Acquisitions

Acquisition
    of Polo Jeans Business

On February 3, 2006, the Company acquired from Jones
    Apparel Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Jones”) all of
    the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun
    Apparel, Inc., the Company’s licensee for men’s and
    women’s casual apparel and sportswear in the United States
    and Canada (the “Polo Jeans Business”). The
    acquisition cost was approximately $260 million, including
    $5 million of transaction costs. The purchase price is
    subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In addition,
    simultaneous with the transaction, the Company settled all
    claims under its litigation with Jones for $100 million
    (see Note 15).

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. However,
    because the Company simultaneously purchased a business and
    settled all pre-existing litigation, the aggregate consideration
    exchanged was required to be allocated for accounting purposes
    in proportion to the underlying fair values of the legal
    settlement and the Polo Jeans Business acquired. Based on the
    arm’s-length negotiation with Jones, the Company determined
    that the fair value of the legal settlement was
    $100 million, which equaled the amount of a litigation
    reserve initially established by the Company during Fiscal 2005.
    The remaining $255 million of consideration exchanged was
    allocated to the Polo Jeans Business based on valuation analyses
    prepared by an independent valuation firm.

The results of operations for the Polo Jeans Business have been
    consolidated in the Company’s results of operations
    commencing February 4, 2006. In addition, the purchase
    price has been allocated on a preliminary basis as follows:
    inventory of $36 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
    $159 million (consisting of the re-acquired license of
    $97 million, customer relationships of $57 million and
    order backlog of $5 million); goodwill of
    $129 million; and deferred tax and other liabilities, net,
    of $64 million. Other than inventory, Jones retained the
    right to all working capital balances on the date of closing.

The Company is in the process of completing its assessment of
    the underlying fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed. As a result, the purchase price allocation to the
    underlying net assets is subject to change. The Company has
    entered into a transition services agreement with Jones to
    provide a variety of operational, financial and information
    systems services over a period of six to twelve months.

Acquisition
    of Footwear Business

On July 15, 2005, the Company acquired from Reebok
    International, Ltd. (“Reebok”) all of the issued and
    outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear
    Co., Inc., the Company’s global licensee for men’s,
    women’s and children’s footwear, as well as certain
    foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok (collectively, the
    “Footwear Business”). The acquisition cost was
    approximately $112 million in cash, including
    $2 million of transaction costs. In addition, Reebok and
    certain of its affiliates entered into a transition services
    agreement with the Company to provide a variety of operational,
    financial and information systems services over a period of
    twelve to eighteen months.

The Company determined that the terms of the pre-existing
    licensing relationship were reflective of market. As such, based
    on valuation analyses prepared by an independent valuation firm,
    the Company allocated all of the consideration exchanged to the
    purchase of the Footwear Business and no settlement gain or loss
    was recognized in connection with the transaction.

The results of operations for the Footwear Business for the
    period are included in the consolidated results of operations
    commencing July 16, 2005. In addition, the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the following
    preliminary allocation of the acquisition cost to the net assets
    acquired based on their respective estimated fair values: trade
    receivables of $17 million; inventory of $26 million;
    finite-lived intangible assets of $62 million (consisting
    of the footwear license at $38 million, customer
    relationships at $23 million and order backlog at
    $1 million); goodwill of $20 million; other assets of
    $1 million; and liabilities of $14 million.

Acquisition
    of Childrenswear Business

On July 2, 2004, the Company acquired certain assets and
    assumed certain liabilities of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC,
    the Company’s licensee holding the exclusive licenses to
    design, manufacture, merchandise and sell newborn, infant,
    toddler, girls and boys clothing in the United States, Canada
    and Mexico (the “Childrenswear Business”). The
    purchase price was approximately $264 million, including
    transaction costs, deferred payments of $15 million payable
    over the three years after the acquisition date and
    $5 million of contingent payments. The contingent payments
    were conditional on certain sales targets being attained and,
    during Fiscal 2005, the Company recognized the obligation with a
    corresponding increase in goodwill because it became probable
    that the sales targets would be attained. As of the end of
    Fiscal 2006, $13 million of the deferred and conditional
    payments were made and the remaining portion of approximately
    $7 million of deferred and conditional payments were
    classified as a component of current liabilities
    ($4 million) and other non-current liabilities
    ($3 million) in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets.

The results of operations for the Childrenswear Business for the
    period are included in the Company’s consolidated results
    of operations commencing July 2, 2004. In addition, the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    following allocation of the acquisition cost to the net assets
    acquired based on their respective fair values: inventory of
    $27 million; property and equipment of $8 million;
    finite-lived intangible assets, of $32 million (consisting
    of non-compete agreements of $2 million and customer
    relationships of $30 million); other assets of

As discussed in Note 3, the Company periodically evaluates
    the recoverability of the carrying value of fixed assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    assets’ values may be impaired. During Fiscal 2006, the
    Company recorded impairment charges of approximately
    $10.8 million to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets,
    primarily relating to its Club Monaco retail business, including
    its Caban Concept and Factory Outlet stores. This impairment
    charge primarily related to

lower-than-expected

store performance and preceded the Company’s implementation
    in February 2006 of a plan to restructure these operations. In
    measuring the amount of the impairment, fair value was
    determined based on discounted expected cash flows. See
    Note 11 for a discussion of the Club Monaco restructuring
    plan and related charges.

The Company recorded a similar $1.5 million retail store
    impairment charge during Fiscal 2005.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 3, the Company accounts for goodwill
    and other intangible assets in accordance with FAS 142.
    Under FAS 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets
    deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized.
    Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are
    subject to annual impairment testing. Finite-lived intangible
    assets continue to be amortized over their respective useful
    lives. Based on the Company’s annual impairment testing of
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of
    Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, no impairment charges
    were deemed necessary.

Restructuring
    Liabilities

The Company has recorded restructuring liabilities over the past
    few years relating to various cost-savings initiatives, as well
    as certain of its acquisitions. In accordance with US GAAP,
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition
    are capitalized as part of the purchase accounting for the
    transaction. Such acquisition-related restructuring costs were
    not material in any period. However, all costs for
    non-acquisition related restructuring initiatives are required
    to be expensed either in the period they were incurred or
    committed to, in accordance with US GAAP. A description of the
    nature of significant non-acquisition related restructuring
    activities and related costs is presented below.

Fiscal
    2006 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company committed
    to a plan to restructure the Company’s Club Monaco retail
    business. In particular, this plan consisted of the closure of
    all five Club Monaco factory outlet stores and the intention to
    dispose of by sale or closure all eight of Club Monaco’s
    Caban Concept Stores (collectively, the “Club Monaco
    Restructuring Plan”). In connection with this plan, an
    aggregate restructuring-related charge of $12 million was
    recognized in Fiscal 2006. This charge consisted of (a) a
    $3 million writedown of inventory to estimated net
    realizable value, which has been classified as a component of
    cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements
    of operations, (b) a $5 million writedown of fixed and
    other net assets, which has been classified as a component of
    restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations and (c) the recognition of a
    $4 million liability relating to lease termination costs,
    which has been classified as a component of restructuring
    charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations. The lease termination costs are expected to be paid
    by the end of Fiscal 2007.

In addition, during its first quarter of Fiscal 2007, the
    Company expects to recognize an additional $2 million
    restructuring charge relating to Club Monaco’s Caban
    Concept stores. Such costs will be incurred pursuant to the Club
    Monaco Restructuring Plan, but are not recognizable until Fiscal
    2007 in accordance with US GAAP because the leased space was
    still being used at the end of Fiscal 2006.

Fiscal
    2005 Restructurings

During Fiscal 2005, the Company incurred approximately
    $2 million of restructuring costs, principally relating to
    severance obligations in connection with its European
    operations. Such obligations were substantially paid by the end
    of Fiscal 2006, and the charge was classified as a component of
    restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

Fiscal
    2004 Restructurings

During Fiscal 2004, the Company incurred approximately
    $19 million of restructuring costs. These restructuring
    costs consisted of (a) approximately $8 million of
    mostly severance-related costs associated with a European
    restructuring, (b) approximately $10 million of
    lease-related costs associated with a retail restructuring and

    charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of

We have available federal, state and foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards of approximately $2 million, $16 million
    and $6 million, respectively, for tax purposes to offset
    future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards
    expire beginning in Fiscal 2007. The utilization of the federal
    net operating loss carryforwards is subject to the limitations
    of Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which applies
    following certain changes in ownership of the entity generating
    the loss carryforward.

Also, we have available state and foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards of approximately $22 million and
    $24 million, respectively, for which no net deferred tax
    asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has

been recorded since we do not believe that we will more likely
    than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future
    taxable income. Additionally, we have recorded a valuation
    allowance against certain other deferred tax assets relating to
    our foreign operations. Subsequent recognition of these deferred
    tax assets, as well as a portion of the foreign net operating
    loss carrryforwards, would result in an income tax benefit in
    the year of such recognition. These valuation allowances have
    been recorded because management has determined that it is more
    likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.

Provision has not been made for United States or additional
    foreign taxes on approximately $222 million of
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Those earnings
    have been and will continue to be reinvested. These earnings
    could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends,
    if foreign earnings were lent to PRLC, a subsidiary or a United
    States affiliate of PRLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries
    were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
    tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practical. We
    believe that the amount of the additional taxes that might be
    payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if remitted,
    would be partially offset by United States foreign tax credits.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs
    Act”) included a special one-time 85% dividends received
    deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
    U.S. taxpayer (the “Repatriation Provision”),
    provided that specified conditions and restrictions are
    satisfied, including a requirement that the foreign repatriated
    earnings are invested in the U.S. pursuant to a domestic
    reinvestment plan. The Company has evaluated the impacts of the
    Repatriation Provision, and has decided to continue to reinvest
    their foreign earnings in investments outside the U.S.

The Company is periodically examined by various federal, state
    and foreign tax jurisdictions. The tax years under examination
    vary by jurisdiction. We regularly consider the likelihood of
    assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions and have
    established tax allowances which represent management’s
    best estimate of the potential assessments. The resolution of
    tax matters could differ from the amount reserved. While that
    difference could be material to the result of operations and
    cash flows for any affected reporting period, it is not expected
    to have a material impact on consolidated financial position or
    consolidated liquidity

Euro
    Debt

The Company has outstanding approximately €227 million
    principal amount of 6.125% notes that are due in November
    2006 (the “Euro Debt”). The carrying value of the Euro
    Debt changes as a result of changes in Euro exchange rates and
    changes in its fair value associated with an interest-rate swap
    agreement that had been used as an effective hedge against
    changes in the fair value of the Euro Debt (see Note 14)

In the event of certain developments involving United States
    withholding taxes or changes in information reporting
    requirements, the Euro Debt may be redeemed in whole at any time
    at their principal amount, together with interest accrued to the
    date fixed for redemption. The Company also has the option to
    redeem the Euro Debt at any time at a price based on the sum of
    the present values on the remaining scheduled redemption dates,
    using a

discount rate based on the midmarket annual yield to maturity of
    the German Government Bund 6.25% due April 2006, or, if that
    security is no longer outstanding, a similar security in the
    reasonable judgment of an independent valuation firm, of the
    then remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on
    the Euro Debt to be redeemed, plus accrued interest. The
    redemption price will in no event be less than 100% of the
    principal amount of the Euro Debt to be redeemed.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

The Company has a credit facility (the “Credit
    Facility”) that currently provides for a $450 million
    revolving line of credit, which can be increased to up to
    $525 million if one or more new or existing lenders under
    the facility agree to increase their commitments. The credit
    facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of
    credit. As of April 1, 2006, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under the Credit Facility, but the Company was
    contingently liable for $46 million of outstanding letters
    of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase commitments).

The Credit Facility expires on October 6, 2009. There are
    no mandatory reductions in borrowing availability throughout its
    term.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate
    equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Company’s
    option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of
    JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time and
    (ii) the weighted-average overnight federal funds rate (as
    published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) plus
    50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in effect from
    time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Board’s
    Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve percentage. The
    applicable margin was 62.5 basis points as of the end of Fiscal
    2006 and is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s
    credit ratings at the time of any borrowings.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings
    under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a
    commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in
    respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate
    was 15 basis points as of the end of Fiscal 2006, and is
    subject to adjustment based on the Company’s credit ratings.

The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among
    other things, restrict the Company’s ability, subject to
    specified exemptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and
    contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including
    equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies;
    liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not
    in a related line of business; make loans, advances or
    guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make
    investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the
    Company to maintain certain financial covenants, consisting of
    (i) a minimum ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
    Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (“EBITDAR”) to the
    sum of Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Lease
    Expense and (ii) a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to
    EBITDAR, as such terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of
    April 1, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all
    covenants under the Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit
    Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the
    Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be
    immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a
    number of events of default (many of which are subject to
    applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure
    to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the
    covenants, including the financial covenants described above.
    Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an event of
    default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities fail
    to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power
    of the Company’s common stock.

Fair
    Value of Debt

Based on the level of market interest rates prevailing at
    April 1, 2006, the fair value of the Company’s
    fixed-rate debt approximated its carrying value. At
    April 2, 2005, the fair value of the Company’s
    fixed-rate debt exceeded

F-24

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

its carrying value by approximately $16 million. Unrealized
    gains or losses on debt do not result in the realization or
    expenditure of cash, unless the debt is retired prior to its
    maturity.

14.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates relating to both the cash flows generated by its
    international operations and the fair value of its foreign
    operations, as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of
    its fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates.
    Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments
    to manage such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative
    transactions for speculative purposes. The following is a
    summary of the Company’s risk management strategies and the
    effect of those strategies on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Foreign
    Currency Risk Management

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as
    hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce its
    risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases and
    intercompany royalty payments. As part of its overall strategy
    to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, primarily exposure to changes in the
    value of the Euro and the Japanese Yen, the Company hedges a
    portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the
    ensuing twelve-month to two year period. In doing so, the
    Company uses foreign exchange contracts that generally have
    maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing
    coverage throughout the hedging period.

At April 1, 2006, the Company had contracts for the sale of
    $90 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these
    $90 million of sales contracts, $22 million were for
    the sale of Euros and $68 million were for the sale of
    Japanese Yen. The fair value of the forward contracts was an
    unrealized loss of $2 million. At April 2, 2005, the
    Company had contracts for the sale of $224 million of
    foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these $224 million of
    sales contracts, $124 million were for the sale of Euros
    and $100 million were for the sale of Japanese Yen. The
    fair value of the forward contracts was an unrealized loss of
    $7 million.

The Company records foreign currency exchange contracts at fair
    value in its balance sheet and designated these derivative
    instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with FAS 133.
    As such, the related gains or losses on these contracts are
    deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains and
    losses are then either recognized in income in the period in
    which the related royalties being hedged are received, or in the
    case of inventory purchases, recognized as part of the cost of
    the inventory being hedged when sold. However, to the extent
    that any of these foreign currency exchange contracts are not
    considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in
    the value of the royalties or inventory purchases being hedged,
    any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of
    these contracts are immediately recognized in earnings. No
    significant gains or losses relating to ineffective hedges were
    recognized in any period.

The Company had deferred net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in the amount of approximately $1 million at the
    end of Fiscal 2006, less than half of which is expected to be
    recognized in earnings in Fiscal 2007. Net losses on foreign
    currency exchange contracts in the amount of approximately
    $6 million were deferred at the end of Fiscal 2005. The
    Company recognized net losses on foreign currency exchange
    contracts in earnings of $5 million for Fiscal 2006 and
    $11 million for Fiscal 2005.

Hedge of
    a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries

The Company has outstanding approximately
    €227.0 million principal amount of Euro Debt. The
    entire principal amount of the Euro Debt has been designated as
    a fair-value hedge of the Company’s net investment in
    certain of its European subsidiaries in accordance with
    FAS 133. As required by FAS 133, the changes in fair
    value of a derivative instrument that is designated as, and is
    effective as, an economic hedge of the net investment in a

F-25

    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a
    translation adjustment under FASB Statement No. 52,
    “Foreign Currency Translation,” to the extent it is
    effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the
    Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate are
    reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded
    gains (losses) in stockholders’ equity on the translation
    of the Euro Debt to U.S. dollars in the amount of
    approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2006, $(18) million for
    Fiscal 2005 and $(31) million for Fiscal 2004.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

Historically, the Company has used floating-rate interest rate
    swap agreements to hedge changes in the fair value of its
    fixed-rate Euro Debt. These interest rate swap agreements, which
    effectively converted fixed interest rate payments on the
    Company’s Euro Debt to a floating-rate basis, were
    designated as a fair value hedge in accordance with
    FAS 133. The Company had interest rate swap agreements on
    the amount of approximately €205 million notional
    amount of indebtness as of the end of Fiscal 2005, but all of
    such swap agreements were terminated in March 2006. No other
    interest rate swap agreements were held as of the end of Fiscal
    2006.

As a fair value hedge, the Company records interest rate swap
    agreements at fair value in its balance sheet. Changes in fair
    value of the interest rate swap agreements are offset in
    earnings against changes in the fair value of the underlying
    portion of the Euro Debt being hedged. In accordance with
    FAS 133, the Company had assumed no hedge ineffectiveness
    as the terms of the interest rate swaps mirrored the terms of
    the Euro debt.

In connection with the termination of these interest rate swap
    agreements in Fiscal 2006, the Company received a net settlement
    of approximately $5 million. Such amount has been reflected
    as an increase in the carrying value of the Euro Debt and will
    be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense (similar to
    the accounting for a debt premium) over the remaining maturity
    of the Euro Debt.

Credit
    Risk

The Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality
    of, the financial institutions that are party to any of its
    financial transactions. Credit risk related to derivative
    financial instruments is considered low because the agreements
    are entered into with strong creditworthy counterparties.

15.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

The Company operates its retail stores under various leasing
    arrangements. The Company also occupies various office and
    warehouse facilities and uses certain equipment under many lease
    agreements. Such leasing arrangements are accounted for in
    accordance with US GAAP as either an operating lease or a
    capital lease. In this context, capital leases include leases
    whereby the Company is considered to have the substantive risks
    of ownership during construction of a leased property pursuant
    to the provisions of EITF

No. 97-10,

“The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset
    Construction” (“EITF 97-10”). Information on
    the Company’s operating and capital leasing activities is
    set forth below.

Operating
    Leases

The Company is typically required to make minimum rental
    payments and often contingent rental payments under its
    operating leases. Substantially all outlet and full-price retail
    store leases provide for contingent rentals based upon sales,
    and certain rental agreements require payment based solely on a
    percentage of sales. Rent expense, net of sublease income which
    was not significant, was $137 million in Fiscal 2006,
    $128 million in Fiscal 2005 and $108 million in Fiscal
    2004. Such amounts include contingent rental charges of
    $12 million in Fiscal 2006, $10 million in Fiscal 2005
    and $8 million in Fiscal 2004. In addition to such amounts,
    the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and
    occupancy costs relating to the leased real estate properties.

    $55 million at April 1, 2006.

In addition, the Company has the right to purchase the 50%

Litigation

Jones
    Apparel Litigation

Since June 2003, the Company had been involved in litigation
    with Jones, primarily relating to certain alleged breaches of
    the terms of the Lauren license agreement between the parties.
    In February 2006, simultaneous with the transaction to acquire
    the Polo Jeans Business from Jones, the Company settled all
    claims under the litigation at a negotiated cost of
    $100 million. The settlement amount equaled the reserve
    initially established by the Company during the fourth quarter
    of Fiscal 2005. Accordingly, the settlement had no effect on the
    Company’s consolidated operating results for Fiscal 2006.

Credit
    Card Matters

We are indirectly subject to various claims relating to
    allegations of a security breach in 2004 of our retail point of
    sale system, including fraudulent credit card charges, the cost
    of replacing cards and related monitoring expenses and other
    related claims. These claims have been made by various banks in
    respect of credit cards issued by them pursuant to the rules of
    Visa

®

and
    MasterCard

credit card associations. We recorded an initial charge of
    $6.2 million to establish a reserve for this matter in the
    fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, representing management’s
    best estimate at the time of the probable loss incurred.
    However, in September 2005, we were notified by our agent bank
    that the aggregate amount of claims had increased to
    $12 million, with an estimated $1 million of
    additional claims yet to be asserted. Accordingly, we recorded
    an additional $6.8 million charge during the second quarter
    of Fiscal 2006 to increase our reserve against this revised
    estimate of total exposure. Such charge has been classified as a
    component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from
    the amounts recorded and could be material to the results of
    operations for any affected period. However, management does not
    expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity or
    financial position.

Wathne
    Imports Litigation

On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd., our domestic
    licensee for luggage and handbags (“Wathne”), filed a
    complaint in the U.S. District Court in the Southern
    District of New York against us and Ralph Lauren, our Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer, asserting, among other things,
    Federal trademark law violations, breach of contract, breach of
    obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
    misrepresentation. The complaint sought, among other relief,
    injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of
    $250 million and punitive damages of not less than
    $750 million. On September 13, 2005, Wathne withdrew
    this complaint from the U.S. District Court and filed a
    complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
    York County, making substantially the same allegations and
    claims (excluding the Federal trademark claims), and seeking
    similar relief. On February 1, 2006, the court granted our
    motion to dismiss all of the causes of action, including the
    cause of action against Mr. Lauren, except for the breach
    of contract claims, and denied Wathne’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction against our production and sale of
    men’s and women’s handbags. On May 16, 2006, a
    discovery schedule was established for this case running through
    November 2006. We believe this suit to be without merit and
    intend to continue to contest it vigorously. Accordingly,
    management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this
    matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Polo
    Trademark Litigation

On October 1, 1999, we filed a lawsuit against the United
    States Polo Association Inc. (“USPA”), Jordache, Ltd.
    and certain other entities affiliated with them, alleging that
    the defendants were infringing on our trademarks. In connection
    with this lawsuit, on July 19, 2001, the USPA and Jordache
    filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court
    for the Southern District of New York. This suit, which was
    effectively a counterclaim by them in connection with the
    original trademark action, asserted claims related to our
    actions in connection with our pursuit of claims against the
    USPA and Jordache for trademark infringement and other unlawful
    conduct. Their claims stemmed from our contacts with the United
    States Polo Association’s and Jordache’s retailers in
    which we informed these retailers of our position in the
    original trademark action. All claims and counterclaims, except
    for our claims that the defendants violated the Company’s
    trademark rights, were settled in September 2003. We did not pay
    any damages in this settlement. On July 30, 2004, the Court
    denied all motions for summary judgement, and trial began on
    October 3, 2005 with respect to the four “double
    horseman” symbols that the defendants sought to use. On
    October 20, 2005, the jury rendered a verdict, finding that
    one of the defendant’s marks violated our world famous Polo
    Player Symbol trademark and enjoining its further use, but
    allowing the defendants to use the remaining three marks. On
    November 16, 2005, we filed a motion before the trial court
    to overturn the jury’s decision and hold a new trial with
    respect to the three marks that the jury found not to be
    infringing. The USPA and Jordache have opposed our motion, but
    have not moved to overturn the jury’s decision that the
    fourth double horseman logo did infringe on our trademarks.
    Pending the judge’s ruling on our motion, it is our belief
    that the USPA and Jordache cannot produce or sell products
    bearing any of the double horseman marks. We have preserved our
    rights to appeal if our motion is denied.

California
    Labor Law Litigation

On September 18, 2002, an employee at one of our stores
    filed a lawsuit against the Company and our Polo Retail, LLC
    subsidiary in the United States District Court for the District
    of Northern California alleging violations of California
    antitrust and labor laws. The plaintiff purported to represent a
    class of employees who had allegedly been injured by a
    requirement that certain retail employees purchase and wear
    Company apparel as a condition of their employment. The
    complaint, as amended, sought an unspecified amount of actual
    and punitive damages, disgorgement of profits and injunctive and
    declaratory relief. The Company answered the amended complaint
    on November 4, 2002. A hearing on cross motions for summary
    judgment on the issue of whether the Company’s policies
    violated California law took place on August 14, 2003. The
    Court granted partial summary judgment with respect to certain
    of the plaintiff’s claims, but concluded that more
    discovery was necessary before it could decide the key issue as
    to whether the Company had maintained for a period of time a
    dress code policy that violated California law. On
    January 12, 2006, a proposed settlement of the purported
    class action was submitted to the court for approval. A hearing
    on the settlement has been scheduled for June 29, 2006. The
    proposed settlement cost of $1.5 million does not exceed
    the reserve for this matter that we established in Fiscal 2005.
    The proposed settlement would also result in the dismissal of
    the similar purported class action filed in San Francisco
    Superior Court as described below.

On April 14, 2003, a second punitive class action was filed
    in the San Francisco Superior Court. This suit, brought by
    the same attorneys, alleges near identical claims to these in
    the Federal class action. The class representatives consist of
    former employees and the plaintiff in the federal court action.
    Defendants in this class action include us and our Polo Retail,
    LLC, Fashions Outlet of America, Inc., Polo Retail, Inc. and
    San Francisco Polo, Ltd. subsidiaries as well as a
    non-affiliated corporate defendant and two current managers. As
    in the federal action, the complaint seeks an unspecified amount
    of actual and punitive restitution of monies spent, and
    declaratory relief. If the judge in the federal class action
    accepts the proposed settlement, the state court class action
    would subsequently be dismissed.

On March 2, 2006, a former employee at our Club Monaco
    store in Los Angeles, California filed a lawsuit against us in
    the San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations of
    California wage and hour laws. The plaintiff

purports to represent a class of Club Monaco store employees who
    allegedly have been injured by being improperly classified as
    exempt employees and thereby not receiving compensation for
    overtime and not receiving meal and rest breaks. The complaint
    seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    disgorgement of profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    relief. We believe this suit is without merit and intend to
    contest it vigorously. Accordingly, management does not expect
    that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

On June 2, 2006, a second punitive class action was filed
    by different attorneys by a former employee of our Club Monaco
    store in Cabazon, California against us in the Los Angeles
    Superior Court alleging virtually identical claims as to the
    San Francisco action and consisting of the same class
    members. As in the San Francisco action, the complaint
    seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    disgorgement of profits, attorneys’ fees and injunctive
    relief. We believe this suit is without merit and intend to
    contest it vigorously. Accordingly, management does not expect
    that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

On May 30, 2006, four former employees of our Ralph Lauren
    stores in Palo Alto and San Francisco, California filed a
    lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court alleging violations
    of California wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs purport to
    represent a class of employees who allegedly have been injured
    by not properly being paid commission earnings, not being paid
    overtime, not receiving rest breaks, and being forced to work
    off the clock while waiting to enter or leave the store and
    being falsely imprisoned while waiting to leave the store. The
    complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,
    damages for emotional distress, disgorgement of profits,
    punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive and
    declaratory relief. We believe this suit is without merit and
    intend to contest it vigorously. Accordingly, management does
    not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Other
    Matters

We are otherwise involved from time to time in legal claims
    involving trademark and intellectual property, licensing,
    employee relations and other matters incidental to our business.
    We believe that the resolution of these other matters currently
    pending will not individually or in the aggregate have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Capital
    Stock

The Company’s capital stock consists of two classes of
    common stock. There are 500 million shares of Class A
    common stock and 100 million shares of Class B common
    stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and
    Class B common stock have substantially identical rights,
    except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A
    common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of
    Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share.
    Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class
    on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval,
    except with respect to the election and removal of directors or
    as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares
    of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren,
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

The Company currently has a common stock repurchase program that
    allows it to repurchase, from time to time, up to
    $100 million of Class A common stock. Share
    repurchases are subject to overall business and market
    conditions. The Company also had a pre-existing common stock
    repurchase program that expired at the end of Fiscal 2006. Under
    that pre-existing program, the Company repurchased 69.3 thousand
    shares of Class A common

stock in Fiscal 2006 at a cost of approximately $4 million.
    No shares of Class A common stock were repurchased in
    Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. Repurchased shares are accounted
    for as treasury stock at cost.

Dividends

In May 2003, the Board of Directors approved a regular,
    quarterly cash dividend program of $0.05 per common share,
    or $0.20 per common share on an annual basis. Dividends
    paid amounted to $21 million in Fiscal 2006,
    $22 million in Fiscal 2005 and $15 million in Fiscal
    2004.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Company has various stock-based incentive plans under which
    it may grant certain equity securities to employees and
    non-employee directors of the Company. Historically, under these
    plans, the Company has issued options to purchase Class A
    common stock, restricted shares of Class A common stock and
    restricted stock units that are payable in shares of
    Class A common stock.

Historically, the Company has used the intrinsic value method to
    account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    APB 25. Accordingly, as stock options have been granted to
    employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal
    to fair market value at the date of grant, compensation cost
    generally has not been recognized for stock option awards.
    However, in accordance with APB 25 compensation cost has
    been recognized for grants of shares of restricted stock and
    restricted stock units.

F-31

POLO
    RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As discussed in Note 4, the Company adopted the fair
    value-based measurement principles of FAS 123R effective in
    Fiscal 2007. Accordingly, all forms of stock-based compensation
    will be accounted for as compensation cost and recognized in the
    statements of operations for Fiscal 2007 and thereafter. See
    Note 3 for the pro forma impact on the Company’s
    historical financial statements of adopting FAS 123R.

A summary of activity for each type of stock-based award is
    presented below:

Stock
    Options

Stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the
    date of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable
    ratably, over a three-year vesting period for employees and a
    two-year vesting period for non-employee directors. The stock
    options generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

For purposes of applying the pro forma disclosure requirements
    of FAS 123, the fair value of each stock option grant was
    estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions
    were used for all grants in Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal
    2004: annual dividend rates of $0.20, $0.20 and $0.20,
    respectively; expected volatility of 29.1%, 35.0% and 40.4%,
    respectively; risk-free interest rates of 3.66%, 3.29% and
    2.56%, respectively; and expected terms to exercise of
    5.2 years for all periods. The weighted-average fair value
    of a stock option granted to employees and non-employee
    directors of the Company was $14.50 in Fiscal 2006, $11.90 in
    Fiscal 2005 and $10.83 in Fiscal 2004.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units

The Company grants a combination of (a) restricted shares
    of Class A common stock, (b) service-based, restricted
    stock units and (c) performance-based, restricted stock
    units to its key executives and non-employee directors.
    Restricted shares of Class A common stock generally vest
    over a five-year period of time, subject to the executive’s
    continuing employment. Service-based, restricted stock units are
    payable in shares of Class A common stock and generally
    vest over a five-year period of time, subject to the
    executive’s continuing employment. Performance-based
    restricted stock units also are payable in shares of
    Class A common stock and generally vest over a three-year
    period of time, subject to the executive’s continuing
    employment and the Company’s satisfaction of certain
    performance goals. In addition, holders of certain restricted
    stock units are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the
    form of additional restricted stock units in connection with the
    payment of dividends on the Company’s Class A common
    stock.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Profit
    Sharing Retirement Savings Plans

The Company sponsors two defined contribution benefit plans
    covering substantially all eligible United States employees not
    covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include
    a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal
    Revenue Code. The Company makes discretionary contributions to
    the plans and contributes an amount equal to 50% of the first 6%
    of salary contributed by an employee.

Under the terms of the plans, a participant is 100% vested in
    Company matching and discretionary contributions after five
    years of credited service. Contributions under these plans
    approximated $5 million, $4 million and
    $4 million in Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004,
    respectively.

Supplemental
    Retirement Plan

The Company has a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for
    certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the
    401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans are expected to
    be constrained by the operation of certain Internal Revenue Code
    limitations. These supplemental benefits vest over time and the
    compensation expense related to these benefits is recognized
    over the vesting period. The amounts accrued under these plans
    were $25 million and $21 million at April 1, 2006
    and April 2, 2005, and are reflected in other non-current
    liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
    Total compensation expense related to these benefits was
    $5 million, $4 million and $4 million in Fiscal
    2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plans

The Company has deferred compensation arrangements for certain
    key executives which generally provide for payments upon
    retirement, death or termination of employment. The amounts
    accrued under these plans were $1 million and
    $2 million at April 1, 2006 and April 2, 2005,
    and are reflected in other non-current liabilities in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation
    expense related to these compensation arrangements was
    $0.3 million for Fiscal 2006, $0.4 million for Fiscal
    2005 and $0.7 million for Fiscal 2004. The Company funds a
    portion of these obligations through the establishment of trust
    accounts on behalf of the executives participating in the plans.
    The trust accounts are reflected in other assets in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Union
    Pension Plan

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is
    required to make contributions to the Union of Needletrades
    Industrial and Textile Employees (“Union”) for dues
    based on wages paid to union employees. A portion of these dues
    is allocated by the Union to a retirement fund which provides
    defined benefits to substantially all unionized workers. The
    Company does not participate in the management of the plan and
    has not been furnished with information with respect to the type
    of benefits provided, vested and non-vested benefits or assets.

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a
    multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its
    proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits.
    Such withdrawal liability was assumed in conjunction with the
    acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee.
    The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the
    plan.

20.

Segment
    Information

The Company has three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail and
    Licensing. Such segments offer a variety of products through
    different channels of distribution. Our Wholesale segment
    consists of women’s, men’s and children’s
    apparel, accessories and related products which are sold to
    major department stores, specialty stores and our owned and
    licensed retail stores in the United States and overseas. Our
    Retail segment consists of the Company’s worldwide retail
    operations, which sell our products through our full price and
    factory outlet stores, as well as Polo.com, our 50%-owned

e-commerce

website. The stores and the website sell products purchased from
    our licensees, our suppliers and our Wholesale segment. Our
    Licensing segment generates revenues from royalties earned on
    the sale of our home and other products internationally and
    domestically through our licensing alliances. The licensing
    agreements grant the licensees rights to use our various
    trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of
    designated products in specified geographical areas.

The accounting policies of our segments are consistent with
    those described in Note 3. Sales and transfers between
    segments are recorded at cost and treated as transfers of
    inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in
    consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating segment
    performance. Each segment’s performance is evaluated based
    upon operating income before restructuring charges and one-time
    items, such as legal charges. Corporate overhead expenses
    (exclusive of expenses for senior management, overall
    branding-related

    $34 million in Fiscal 2005 and $29 million in Fiscal
    2004.

In addition, Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company’s Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer, sometimes uses the services of
    certain employees of the Company for non-Company related
    purposes. Mr. Lauren reimburses the Company for the direct
    expenses incurred in connection with those services, including
    an allocation of such employees’ salaries and benefits.
    Such costs and related reimbursements were less than
    $1 million in the aggregate in each of the three fiscal
    years ended April 1, 2006.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of April 1, 2006 and April 2,
    2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended April 1, 2006. These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Polo
    Ralph Lauren Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 1,
    2006 and April 2, 2005, and the results of their operations
    and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended April 1, 2006, in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of April 1, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated June 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and
    an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting because of a material
    weakness.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report of Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting under Item 9A, that Polo Ralph Lauren
    Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) did not
    maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 1, 2006, because of the effect of the material
    weakness identified in management’s assessment based on
    criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. As described in Management’s Report of Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from their
    assessment the internal control over financial reporting of its
    Footwear Business and Polo Jeans Business, which were acquired
    during the year ended April 1, 2006 and whose financial
    statements, in the aggregate, reflect total assets and revenues
    constituting 14.7 and 2.6 percent, respectively, of the
    related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
    the year ended April 1, 2006. Accordingly, our audit did
    not include the internal control over financial reporting of the
    Company’s Footwear Business and Polo Jeans Business. The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination
    of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
    likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
    financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
    following material weakness has been identified and included in
    management’s assessment: As of April 1, 2006, certain
    controls designed to prevent and detect errors related to income
    tax accounting and disclosures did not operate effectively. This
    was largely related to inadequate internal tax resources for a
    sufficient period of time, lack of formal training for tax
    personnel and inadequate controls and procedures over the tax
    accounting process to complete a comprehensive and timely review
    of the income tax accounts and required tax footnote
    disclosures. This material weakness was considered in
    determining the nature, timing, and extent of

F-41

audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial
    statements of the Company as of and for the year ended
    April 1, 2006, and this report does not affect our report
    on such financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    did not maintain effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 1, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the effect
    of the material weakness described above on the achievement of
    the control objectives of the control criteria, the Company has
    not maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 1, 2006, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for
    each of the three years in the period ended April 1, 2006
    and our report dated June 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those financial statements.
