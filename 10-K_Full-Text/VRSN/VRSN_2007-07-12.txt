EXPLANATORY NOTE

In this
Form 10-K, we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004.

We are also restating the unaudited quarterly
financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and the unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The decision to restate was based on the results of an independent review
into our stock option accounting that was conducted under the direction of an ad hoc group of our independent directors who had not served on our Compensation Committee before 2005 (“Ad Hoc Group”). As part of the restatement, we have also
made adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 to correct errors identified for these fiscal years, which were not material to our financial statements in the aggregate or
for any prior fiscal year.

Previously filed annual reports on
Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied upon.

We first learned of the potential issues associated with our past stock option grants from a May 16, 2006 article published by the Center for
Financial Research and Analysis (“CFRA”) in which we were referenced as one of 15 public companies with one or two stock grants between 1997 and 2002 that the CFRA suggested were timed at, or close to, 40-day lows in the applicable
company’s stock price or preceding a material change in the stock price. Promptly after learning of the CFRA article, and prior to receiving the grand jury subpoena or the informal SEC request described below, the Ad Hoc Group, with the
assistance of independent outside counsel, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP (“Cleary Gottlieb”), began reviewing the facts and circumstances of the timing of our historical stock option grants for the period January 1998
to May 2006 (“relevant period”). We believe that the analysis was properly limited to the relevant period. In addition to Cleary Gottlieb, the Ad Hoc Group was assisted in its Review by independent forensic accountants (collectively
the “Review Team”).

On June 27, 2006, we
announced that we had received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents relating to our stock option grants and practices dating back to January 1, 1995, and had received an
informal request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) related to our stock option grants and practices. On February 9, 2007, we subsequently received a formal order of investigation from the SEC. We
are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s investigation and the SEC investigation.

On November 21, 2006, we announced that the Ad Hoc Group had determined the need to restate our historical financial statements to record additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to past stock
option grants.

On March 30, 2007, we requested guidance
from the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC (the “OCA”) concerning certain accounting issues relating to the restatement of our historical financials and the Review. On June 25, 2007, we concluded our discussions with the OCA
regarding these accounting issues.

On May 29, 2007, we
announced that Stratton Sclavos, our then-current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, had resigned from his position with the Company. Following Mr. Sclavos’ resignation, the Board elected director William A. Roper, Jr. as our President
and CEO and Edward Mueller as our Chairman of the Board of Directors.

On July 10, 2007, Dana L. Evan, our then-current Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer resigned from her position with VeriSign.



On July 5, 2007 and July 12, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Albert E. Clement as Chief Accounting
Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of the Company.

The Review Team tested grants made on 239 dates, incurred 21,800 person-hours, searched more than 11 million pages of physical and electronic
documents and conducted 75 interviews of 33 current and former directors, officers, employees, and advisors. We announced on January 31, 2007 that the Ad Hoc Group’s Review was substantially completed and that, based on a review of the
totality of evidence and the applicable law, the Review did not find intentional wrongdoing by any current member of the senior management team or the former CEO. The Ad Hoc Group’s Review concluded that we failed to implement appropriate
processes and controls for granting, accounting for, and reporting stock option grants and that corporate records in certain circumstances were incomplete or inaccurate.

The Review Team examined all grants to Section 16 officers and directors during the relevant period, as well as 7
annual performance grants to rank and file employees and 179 acquisition, new hire and promotion, and other grants to rank and file employees on 239 dates from January 1998 through January 2006.

The Review Team identified 8,164 stock option grants made on 41 dates during
the relevant period for which measurement dates were incorrectly determined. The measurement dates required revision because the stated date either preceded or was subsequent to the proper measurement date and the stock price on the stated date was
generally lower than the price on the proper measurement date. In several instances, the Review Team also determined that the stock price assigned on the initial grant dates was subsequently modified, without being given the required accounting and
disclosure treatment.

Consistent with the accounting
literature and recent guidance from the SEC, as part of the restatement, the grants during the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was finalized. The evidence related to each category of
grant was analyzed including, but not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, and consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the
SEC, the controlling accounting standards were applied to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required,
resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related income tax effects.

Measurement Date Hierarchy

We have adopted
the following framework for determining the measurement dates of our stock option grants and have applied this framework to each grant based on the facts, circumstances and availability of documentation.

•

We reviewed the date of the minutes of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee meetings for grants made at such meetings when the number of options and
exercise price for each recipient had been clearly approved. Where the Review Team determined that the meeting date was not the measurement date, the Review Team determined the actual date of approval of the grant via other documentary evidence and
interviews.

•

When a grant was approved by unanimous written consent (“UWC”), the measurement date was the date of the Compensation Committee’s approval of the UWC
as established by available evidence, such as receipt of signature pages of the UWC, contemporaneous telephone and/or e-mail communications.

•

If a grant was approved by the CEO under authority delegated by the Compensation Committee, the measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval
to the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price.

•

If a grant was approved by the CEO based on the mistaken belief that he had delegated authority to do so (de facto or “substantive” authority), the
measurement date was the date on which the CEO



communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the
number of options and exercise price.

•

In the event the date on which the CEO communicated approval was not evident from the approval forms, the measurement date was the date on which other available
evidence, such as the surrounding e-mail communications, established the date the CEO approved the grant.

•

In the event the date of CEO approval could not be established by reviewing other available evidence, such as e-mails, the measurement date was the date on which
the number of options and exercise price were entered into our option tracking database (Equity Edge).

•

Except for grants to Section 16 officers which require Compensation Committee approval, for new hire grants and promotion grants, prior to March 13, 1998,
the measurement date was the date the Compensation Committee approved the grant (as described above). For new hire grants and promotion grants after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and after September 30, 2002, the measurement
date was the 15th day or the last day of the month (or the prior business day if that day was not a business day) following the actual and documented start date or promotion date of the respective employee receiving the grant. New hire grants and
promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval. For new hire grants and promotion grants in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002, the measurement date was
the date on which the CEO communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price. If that date could not be
determined, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge.

After determining the measurement date through the steps in the above Measurement Date Hierarchy, we then determined if there were any changes to the
individual recipients, exercise prices or amount of shares granted after such measurement date. If there were no changes following such measurement date, then that date would be used. If we identified changes following such measurement date, then we
would evaluate whether the changes should delay the measurement date for the entire list of grants on that date, result in a repricing, or result in separate accounting for specific grants.

Director Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    Grants to directors under the 1998 Director Plan (the
“Director Plan”) were automatic and non-discretionary; the Director Plan did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee to review or approve director grants. Each new director received an initial grant of a specified
number of options on the date of his or her appointment and annually on the anniversary of the initial grant to be priced on the appointment or anniversary date, respectively. Directors serving before the Director Plan was adopted received an annual
grant on the anniversary of their previous grant.

Method
for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    For the initial grant, the measurement date was the date the director was appointed to the Board, as reflected in Board minutes. In the absence of Board minutes, the measurement
date was the date specified in the proxy statement or, if not clear, the date of the first Board meeting attended by the new director. For anniversary grants, the measurement date was the annual anniversary of the initial grant (or the next business
day if such date was not a business day).

Executive Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation
Committee is required to approve all grants to executive officers. For grants to the former CEO, the Review Team concluded that, in all but three cases (including the February 2002 grant described below), the Compensation Committee or the Board of
Directors approved the grant on the stated grant date, resulting in a correct measurement date.



Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    For grants other than the
February/May 2002 grant described below, including the other two grants to the former CEO referred to above, please refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Acquisition Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    CEO authorization required. The Board of Directors implicitly delegated to the CEO authority to
approve grants to employees from acquisitions when the Board approved an acquisition.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Annual Refresh Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation Committee was required to approve all annual refresh grants through and
including the 2004 annual refresh grant. In 2005, the Compensation Committee delegated to the CEO the authority to approve rank and file annual refresh grants.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Extended Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors is required to
approve all extensions of grants.

Method for Determining
Proper Measurement Dates

:    Extended grants are a modification of a previous award. Available documentation was used to establish the modification date and to measure the additional compensation charge.

Retention and Off-Cycle Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation
Committee is required to approve all retention and off-cycle grants.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Documentation Hierarchy above. For the February/May 2002 retention grant described below, the former CEO approved the grants to rank and file
employees.

New Hire and Promotion Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    New hire grants and
promotion grants made after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and those made after September 30, 2002 were automatic and did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee review or approval. Prior to March 13,
1998, the Compensation Committee was required to approve all new hire and promotion grants. New hire grants and promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement
Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

The 8,164 grants previously identified as having incorrectly determined measurement dates were classified into the following six categories: (1) 27 grants on 11 dates to persons elected or appointed as
members of the Board of Directors (“Director Grants”); (2) 33 grants to executive officers (“Executive Grants”); (3) 2,908 grants to employees issued after an acquisition, newly hired employees and promoted employees
under the new hire and promotion grants program described below (“New Hire and Promotion Grants Program”), and other grants to a



large number of non-executives; (4) 4,226 grants made in broad-based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (“Annual
Refresh Grants”); (5) 964 off-cycle performance grants; and (6) 6 grants whereby the expiration dates were extended (“Extended Grants”). All references to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices
have been adjusted for all subsequent stock splits.

As
discussed below, it was determined that the originally assigned grant dates for 8,164 grants were not ascribed the proper measurement dates for accounting purposes. Accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures, stock-based compensation expense of
$171.4 million on a pre-tax basis was recognized over the respective awards’ vesting terms for the periods from 1998 to 2006. As noted below, we also considered alternative measurement dates for eight grant dates which, if applied, would have
resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of approximately $25.7 million. The adjustments made to reflect the proper measurement dates for accounting purposes and the financial statement impact of the alternative measurement dates
considered by us, were determined by category as follows:

Director Grants

:    64 director grants were made on 36 dates during the relevant period. Of the 64 grants, there were 27 grants to directors for which it was determined that the originally determined grant dates
preceded or succeeded the measurement dates, 11 grants were in excess of plan parameters, and some of the dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. Of the 27 grants with measurement date issues, 26 of the grants involved
periods of 5 days or less and resulted in a stock-based compensation expense of less than $100,000 in the aggregate. Revisions to measurement dates for director grants were made where the wrong date was selected based on the requirements of the
Director Plan and where incorrect start dates were used for the date the director joined the Board of Directors. The excess grants have been historically honored by us. As a result, $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

Executive Officer Grants

:    It was
determined that for 33 of the grants to executive officers, the originally determined grant dates preceded the measurement dates or the grant dates and exercise prices were subsequently changed. Some of these dates were selected in hindsight based
on an advantageous share price. As the stock prices on the originally determined grant dates were lower than the stock prices on the proper measurement date, $28.1 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized. The revised measurement
dates for various executive officer grants were based on Compensation Committee meeting dates, signed UWCs, delayed CEO approval, and for one date the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were
entered into Equity Edge. We also considered an alternative measurement date for one grant date which would have increased the compensation expense by approximately $130,000 for that grant. The authority for 21 grants, which have been historically
honored by us, is based on the CEO’s presumed authority.

New Hire and Promotion Grants Program

:    We concluded that the new hire and promotion grants made pursuant to the New Hire and Promotion Grants Program within the pre-established guidelines did not require an
adjustment, with the exception of the grants made from September 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002. For the 1,728 grants made during that time period, management concluded that the measurement dates occurred only on the dates of the CEO
approval. Due to practical difficulties in ascertaining the actual dates of the CEO approval for many new hire and promotion grants in that time period, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price
were entered into Equity Edge. The incremental stock-based compensation expense associated with the New Hire and Promotion Grants during the relevant period was $11.9 million.

Acquisition Grants

:    After the consummation of certain acquisitions, we granted stock options
to employees of the acquired entities. It was determined that the measurement dates for 1,180 option grants required revision because the stated grant dates preceded the proper measurement dates and the approval authority was based on CEO approval.
Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. Of the 1,180 grants, 1,048 grants were extinguished as part of our exchange program which commenced in November 2002. Due to issues associated with the
measurement dates for the acquisition grants, $36.2 million of additional stock-based compensation expense was recognized during the relevant period. We also considered an



alternative measurement date for three different acquisition grant dates which, if they had been used, would have increased the compensation expense by
approximately $675,000.

Annual Refresh
Grants

:    During the relevant period, 3,782 broad-based grants were made to employees under an annual program (the “Refresh Grants”) for which the originally assigned grant dates were not the proper measurement
dates. Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, and the authority for some of the Refresh Grants was the CEO’s presumed authority. For one of the annual Refresh Grants which occurred in
August 2000, there was conflicting documentation and inconclusive evidence with respect to the measurement date. It was determined that the most appropriate measurement date, due to the lack of affirmative evidence otherwise, was the date on
which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge, and based on that date, $19.2 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the period 2000 to 2002. These grants were extinguished in December 2002
as part of our exchange program which commenced in November 2002. We did not approve or process any stock option grants to existing employees during the period of the tender offer or agree or imply that we would compensate employees for any
increases in the market price during the tender period. The Review also determined that the annual refresh grants for the years 1999, 2001, 2004, and a portion of the 2003 grant had a measurement date that was later than the date that was originally
used. In these cases, where the measurement dates were revised, the authority for the grants varied and included new dates based on UWCs by the Compensation Committee or approvals by the CEO. Where approval was not determinable based on the above,
we utilized the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. Due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the annual refresh grants, stock-based compensation expense of $55.1 million was recognized.
We also considered alternative measurement dates for two Refresh Grants which did not create additional compensation charge where one alternative measurement date had a lower price than the original grant date and the options for the second
alternative measurement date were cancelled prior to the one-year cliff vesting date.

Off-Cycle Performance Grants

:    There were 964 performance grants made to employees on March 15, 2001 and October 1, 2003. These dates were chosen in hindsight based on an
advantageous share price, and the authority for these grants was the CEO’s de facto authority. The revised measurement dates were based on the dates of the UWC for the March 15, 2001 grant and e-mail correspondence for the October 1,
2003 grant. Due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the off-cycle performance grants, stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million was recognized. We also considered an alternative measurement date for the October 1, 2003
grant which, if it had been used, would have decreased the compensation expense by approximately $100,000 for that grant.

Extended Grants

:    During the relevant period, there were 6 stock option extensions (including one to the former CEO described
below) whereby an option was extended beyond its expiration or termination date and for which a compensation charge had not been recorded. As a result, $2.1 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

The former CEO received certain options from Network Solutions, Inc.
(“NSI”) in his capacity as a NSI director prior to our acquisition of NSI. Upon receiving legal advice, management extended the term of those options beyond their original expiration date. The former CEO exercised those options on
May 24, 2002. The Ad Hoc Group reviewed the extension of these options and determined that the legal advice was incorrect and that the options should not have been extended. Upon learning of this determination in January 2007, the former CEO
voluntarily paid $174,425 to us, reflecting the after-tax net profit he received from the exercise of those options.

2002 Retention Grants

:    Between February and May 2002, the Compensation Committee considered special option grants as a
retention incentive for executive officers and other executives and key employees, since in many cases the exercise prices of options previously granted to these individuals were significantly above the then-current market price for shares of our
common stock. These retention grants are summarized as follows:

Grants to Executive Officers and Other Executives

:    We determined that 68 grants of options for a total of 4,631,000 shares to executive officers and other executives were finalized on April 10, 2002 rather
than the



stated grant date of February 21, 2002. The Review Team was unable, after review of detailed documentation, including multiple draft versions of the
February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee minutes, approval forms (which were undated) and email correspondence, to affirmatively determine when the grants to executive officers and other executives were approved. In accordance with our
measurement date hierarchy for grants described above, we determined that April 10, 2002 was the correct measurement date because that was the date that other grants, including certain executive grants, were entered into Equity Edge. The grant
price as of the measurement date was $23.74, the closing market price of our stock on April 10, 2002. Because the stated exercise price of the grants was set based on the closing market price on February 21, 2002 of $22.71 and preceded the
measurement date, an incremental $1.3 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

We also determined that the Compensation Committee repriced 1,870,000 of these options on May 24, 2002, with an exercise price of $10.08, the closing
market price of our stock on May 24, 2002. We determined that these grants were a reprice based on a UWC of the Compensation Committee. The accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval
and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. In accordance with FIN 44 and after applying variable accounting, we recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately $15.8 million, net of reversals, for
the periods between 2002 and 2006. Had we considered an alternative measurement date between the periods from February 13, 2002 through April 25, 2002, compensation expense would have increased by up to $25.0 million for these grants.

Grants to Employees

:    Broad-based
employee grants were also considered during the February to May 2002 period. The Review Team determined that the CEO, under his presumed authority, approved 305 broad-based employee grants on or about March 20, 2002 with a grant price
of $26.42, the closing market price of our stock on that date. These awards were communicated shortly thereafter to the employees. We determined that March 20, 2002 was a definitive measurement date for the awards to the employees.

The grants to employees previously approved by the CEO on March 20,
2002 were submitted for approval to the Compensation Committee as evidenced in a UWC dated May 24, 2002. The Compensation Committee approved the 305 employee grants with an exercise price of $10.08, the market value of our common stock on
May 24, 2002. Therefore the employee awards were re-priced on that date. Although the awards had been communicated to the employees and disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2002, the accounting impact of the repricing was not
recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing, and after applying variable accounting, approximately $6.6 million, net of reversals of
additional stock-based compensation expense, has been recorded for the periods between 2002 and 2006.

Retention Grants to our former CEO

:    In the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee meeting, the Committee considered
the number and vesting period of a proposed option award to the CEO. The Review Team found multiple draft versions of the minutes for the February 12, 2002 meeting of the Compensation Committee and concluded that the signed minutes were
inaccurate. Attendees at the meeting have different recollections of the business conducted. One draft, unapproved version of those minutes, stated the number of options to be awarded to the CEO was 1,200,000, while the signed version of the minutes
approved by the members of the Compensation Committee in late May 2002 stated that the number of options to be awarded was 600,000. Both versions of the minutes stated that the grant date and the exercise price was February 21, 2002 and
$22.71. The minutes of a Board meeting held on February 12, 2002, after the Compensation Committee meeting, also indicate that the CEO was awarded 1,200,000 options at the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee meeting.

We have determined that the measurement date for the 1,200,000 options to the
CEO was February 12, 2002 with a grant price of $26.31, the closing market price of our stock on that date, and that the options were repriced on February 21, 2002 with a grant price of $22.71, the closing market price of our stock on that
date. Subsequently, 600,000 options of the 1,200,000 options were repriced on May 24, 2002 with a grant price of $10.08, the closing market price of our stock on that date. The accounting impact of the repricings was not



recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing,
and after applying variable accounting, approximately $7.5 million, net of reversals, of additional stock-based compensation expense has been recorded for the periods between 2002 and 2006.

Actions Taken by the Board with respect to
Grants

:    As part of the Review, the Board of Directors confirmed all option grants (including those to our former CEO and CFO) that the Review Team concluded had authority issues as legally binding and enforceable
obligations of us as of the date of such grant. In addition, the Board of Directors decided to modify the following grants to the former CEO and CFO in 2007 and no reversal of compensation expense was recorded for these negative modifications in the
financial statements.

Former
CEO

:    An option grant to the former CEO of 100,000 shares originally dated December 29, 2000 at an exercise price of $74.188 was modified to a new exercise price of $127.31.

Former CEO

:    The February 2002 option grant to
the former CEO of 600,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $26.31.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to the CFO of 25,000 shares originally dated December 29, 2000 at an exercise price of
$74.188 was modified to a new exercise price of $127.31.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to the CFO of 125,000 shares originally dated August 1, 2000 at an exercise price of $151.25 was modified to a new exercise price of $165.22.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to the CFO of
40,000 shares originally dated March 15, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.438 was modified to a new exercise price of $42.26. The CFO’s 409A tax election described below modified 1,667 of these options and the Board of Directors determined
to modify the remaining 38,333 options.

Former
CFO

:    A grant to the CFO of 90,000 shares originally dated September 6, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.16 was modified to a new exercise price of $38.30. The CFO’s 409A tax election described below modified
11,250 of these options and the Board of Directors determined to modify the remaining 78,750 options.

Former CFO

:    The February 2002 option grant to the CFO of 100,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an
exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $23.74.

Other

:    The Company and the Review Team also determined that the former CEO received an option grant in October 1998 for 100,000 shares (95,928 non-qualified stock options
(“NQSOs”) and 4,072 incentive stock options (“ISOs”)), which split to options for 200,000 shares in May 1999 and then split again to options for 400,000 shares in November 1999 when we announced a stock split during
those respective periods. The account statements and monthly reporting statements for November 1 and December 1, 2000 showed that the former CEO held options for 400,000 shares at the split-adjusted price of $7.67. However, the Ad Hoc
Group determined that sometime between December 1, 2000 and January 1, 2001, we erroneously changed the former CEO’s options to reflect the pre-split amount of 100,000 shares instead of 400,000 shares, but at the post-split price of
$7.67. The error was never subsequently corrected. Therefore, the former CEO did not receive the benefit of the additional 300,000 options arising from the two stock splits, which expired in 2005. Based on a determination by the Board of Directors
after the Ad Hoc Group’s Review in May 2007, we have agreed to pay the former CEO $5,459,430, reflecting the gain he would have realized from the exercise of these options prior to their expiration, based on the weighted-average price of stock
options exercised by the former CEO in August 2005.

The other
principal factual findings of the Review included the following:

•

The human resources, accounting, and legal departments failed to implement appropriate processes and controls. During 2000 through 2003, the option grant process
was characterized by a high degree of informality and relatively little oversight.



•

The Review found no evidence that accounting personnel were aware of the deficient practices used in selecting grant dates.

•

The Review found instances of incomplete and inaccurate corporate records, including two sets of Committee minutes that were inaccurate.

•

The Review found no evidence of fictitious individuals being granted options.

•

Options found to be misdated, have a date chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, repriced, or unauthorized with a stated exercise price lower
than the share price at the actual approval date will result in adverse tax consequences to the recipients and us.

•

In light of the Review’s other findings, our disclosures related to option grants were inaccurate in some respects.

The principal recommendations of the Ad Hoc Group’s Review included the
following:

•

The Board or the Compensation Committee should approve all grants that the Review found to be unauthorized, with the exception of certain grants made to our former
CEO and CFO. The Board or the Compensation Committee should consider whether to cancel or request forfeiture of any options granted to the former CEO and CFO that were determined to be unauthorized, misdated, have a date chosen in hindsight based on
an advantageous share price, or repriced, and then should consider the appropriate equity compensation for these officers for the periods covered by the Review.

•

We should develop and implement detailed written grant policies.

•

We should designate individuals in the legal and accounting departments to oversee the documentation of and accounting for option grants.

•

We should develop and implement improved training and controls relating to option granting practices to ensure that all personnel involved in the granting and
administration of stock options understand the relevant option plans and accounting, tax, and disclosure requirements.

•

We should award regular grants (new hire, promotion, and annual performance) at predetermined dates and with all approvals documented and finalized on those dates.

The Board has adopted all of the
Review’s findings and recommendations. The Company, under the direction of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, and with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has implemented or is in the process of implementing the
recommendations.

Based on the results of the Review, we have
recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense (benefit) and related income tax effects related to past stock option grants of $1.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, ($21.6 million) and $36.9 million in
fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. These adjustments were recorded based on the evidence and findings from the Ad Hoc Group’s review, including analysis of the measurement dates for the 8,164 stock option grants made on 41 dates during
the relevant period that the Review determined were incorrect.



The incremental impact from recognizing stock-based compensation expense resulting from the Ad Hoc
Group’s Review of past stock option grants is as follows (in thousands):

(1)

Pre-tax expense adjustments are through March 31, 2006 and represents amounts being reported pursuant to FAS 123R whereas amounts for all other years represent amounts being
reported pursuant to APB 25.

(2)

Includes $0.8 million of other stock-based compensation adjustments that were unrelated to past stock option grants.

Additionally, the pro forma expense under SFAS No. 123 in Note 1 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K has been restated to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

As noted above we considered alternative measurement dates for eight grants
which, if applied, would have resulted in additional stock-based compensation of approximately $25.7 million. With the exception of these eight grants, there was no uncertainty on the measurement date for option grants. The table below shows what
the incremental impact to stock-based compensation expense would have been by category of grant had these alternative measurement dates been applied (in thousands):

Tax Implications

We evaluated the impact of the restatements on our global tax provision and
have determined that a portion of the tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation expense formerly associated with stock option deductions is attributable to continuing operations. We identified deferred tax assets totaling $16.3 million at
December 31, 2005 which reflect the benefit of tax deductions from future employee stock option exercises. We have not realized this or any other deferred tax asset relating to taxing jurisdictions within the United States as of



December 31, 2005. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our realization of United States-based deferred tax assets.

We also believe that we should not have taken a tax deduction
under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m) in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives. Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. As a result, our tax
net operating losses associated with the stock option intra-period allocation have decreased by $12.6 million. We continue to apply a valuation allowance to our tax net operating losses relating to stock options exercised prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

”. Pursuant to Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R, we recognize financial statement benefit of these tax net operating losses when such losses reduce cash taxes paid.

Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 409A”)
imposes significant penalties on individual income taxpayers who were granted stock options that were unvested as of December 31, 2004 and that have an exercise price of less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant
(“Affected Options”). These tax consequences include income tax at vesting, an additional 20% tax and interest charges. In addition, the issuer of Affected Options must comply with certain reporting and withholding obligations under
Section 409A.

These adverse tax consequences may be
avoided for unexercised Affected Options if the exercise price of the Affected Option is adjusted to reflect the fair market value at the time the option was granted (as such measurement date is determined for financial reporting purposes). Under
Treasury regulations, Affected Options held by executive officers or directors were to be amended on or before December 31, 2006 to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A; holders of Affected Options who are not executive
officers or directors have until December 31, 2007 to amend their Affected Options to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A. Four of our current and former executive officers and a current director holding Affected Options
elected to increase the exercise price of their Affected Options to the market price on December 31, 2006. Effective December 31, 2006, the exercise prices of Affected Options held by D. James Bidzos, a current board member, Dana Evan,
former Chief Financial Officer, Robert Korzeniewski, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, Judy Lin, former Executive Vice President of Security Services and Mark McLaughlin, Executive Vice President of Products, Marketing and Customer
Support, were adjusted so that these options will not be subject to Section 409A. We are currently considering actions to avoid or alleviate certain of the adverse tax consequences associated with Affected Options for employees who are not
executive officers of the Company and whether to offer compensation to the executive officers and director who elected to increase the exercise price of their Affected Options as of December 31, 2006. Should we decide to take actions to avoid
or alleviate these adverse tax consequences associated with current and former employees’ outstanding Affected Options, we estimate the related compensatory payments would be approximately $11.6 million. In June 2007, we made payments of
approximately $0.9 million on behalf of current and former employees who exercised Affected Options in 2006 under the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board 409A Compliance Resolution Programs. We estimate the cost to participate in these
compliance resolution programs, including a gross-up payment to the affected employees, will be approximately $1.9 million.

their communications. Consumer customers may pay bills online and obtain information on charges, while business users may conduct sophisticated analyses and cost allocations.

Operations Infrastructure

Our operations infrastructure consists of secure data centers in Mountain View, California; Dulles, Virginia; Lacey, Washington; Providence, Rhode Island;
Overland Park, Kansas; Melbourne, Australia; and Kawasaki, Japan. We are currently in the process of building a new secure data center in New Castle, Delaware. Most of these secure data centers operate on a 24-hours-a-day, 7 days per week,
365-days-a-year basis, supporting our business units and services. Key features of our operations infrastructure include:

•

Distributed Servers.

We deploy a large number of high-speed servers to support capacity and availability demands that in conjunction
with our proprietary software offers automatic failover, global and local load balancing and threshold monitoring on critical servers.

•

Advanced Telecommunications.

We deploy and maintain redundant telecommunications and routing hardware and maintain high-speed
connections to multiple Internet service providers (“ISPs”) to ensure that our mission critical services are readily accessible to customers at all times.

•

Network Security.

We incorporate architectural concepts such as protected domains, restricted nodes and distributed access control in
our system architecture. We have also developed proprietary communications protocols within and between software modules that are designed to prevent most known forms of electronic attacks. In addition, we employ firewalls and intrusion detection
software, and contract with security consultants who perform periodic probes to test our systems and assess security risks.

As part of our operations infrastructure for our domain name registry services, we operate all domain name servers that answer domain name lookups for the

.com

and

.net

zones. We also operate two of the thirteen externally visible root zone server addresses, including the “A” root, which is considered to be the authoritative root zone server of the Internet’s domain name
system (“DNS”). The domain name servers provide the associated name server and IP address for every

.com

and

.net

domain name on the Internet and a large number of other top-level domain queries, resulting in an average of
over 19 billion responses per day during 2006. These name servers are located around the world, providing local domain name service throughout North America, Europe,



and Asia. Each server facility is a controlled and monitored environment, incorporating security and system maintenance features. This network of name
servers is one of the cornerstones of the Internet’s DNS infrastructure.

To provide our communications services, we operate a SS7 network composed of specialized switches, computers and databases strategically located across the United States. These elements interconnect our customers and
U.S. telecommunications carriers through leased lines. Our network currently consists of 16 mated pairs of SS7 signal transfer points (“STPs”) that are specialized switches that route SS7 signaling messages, and into which our customers
connect. We own ten pairs of STPs and lease capacity on six pairs of STPs from regional providers. Our SS7 network control center, located in Overland Park, Kansas, is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Call Centers and Help Desk.

We provide customer
support services through our phone-based call centers, email help desks and Web-based self-help systems. Our California call center is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and employs an automated call directory system to support our Security
Services business. Our Georgia call center is staffed from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time and our Washington state call center is staffed from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time and employs an automated call directory system to support our
Communications Services business. Our Virginia call center is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to support our Information Services business. All call centers have a staff of trained customer support agents and provide Web-based support
services that are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, utilizing customized automatic response systems to provide self-help recommendations.

Operations Support and Monitoring

.    We have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and
performance of our critical database systems and our global resolution systems. Our distributed Network Operations Centers are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Disaster Recovery Plans

.    We have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that
are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities. Our Information Services business maintains dual mirrored data centers that allow rapid failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity. Our Security
Services business is similarly protected by having service capabilities that exist in both of our East and West Coast data center facilities. Our critical data services (including digital certificates, domain name registration, telecommunications
services and global resolution) use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as mirroring and remote replication.

Marketing, Sales and Distribution

We market our services worldwide through multiple distribution channels, including the Internet, direct sales, telesales, direct marketing through all
media, mass merchandisers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and VeriSign Affiliates. We intend to increase our direct sales force in the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group both in the United States and abroad,
and to expand our other distribution channels in both businesses.

Our direct sales and marketing organization at December 31, 2006 consisted of 989 individuals, including managers, sales representatives, and marketing, technical and customer support personnel. We have field sales offices throughout
the world.

Research and Development

As of December 31, 2006, we had 1,022 employees dedicated to research
and development. We believe that timely development of new and enhanced Internet security, e-commerce, information, and communications services and technologies are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend to
continue recruiting and hiring experienced research and development personnel and to make additional investments in research and development.



Our future success will
depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services. In the past, we have developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major
customers. We have also, in certain circumstances, acquired or licensed technology from third parties. Although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts, we expect that most of the future
enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally or acquired through business acquisitions.

The markets for our services are dynamic, characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry
standards. The constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services, particularly in response to competitive offerings, and to
introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors.

Competition

We compete
in markets with our naming services, security services, commerce services, communication services, content services, and managed security services. We compete with numerous companies in each of these services categories. The overall number of our
competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time.

Several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more
quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or
services directly to customers through bundling or other means. If such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers, the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to
distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished.

New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure. We cannot assure you that competing technologies developed
by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our markets are characterized by announcements of
collaborative relationships involving our competitors. The existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, we may not be able to
compete effectively with current or future competitors, and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business. See the section titled “The business environment is highly competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, we
may suffer price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share” of Item 1A of the “Risk Factors” for additional details regarding our competition.

Industry Regulation

Information Services.

Within the U.S. Government, oversight of Internet administration is provided by the U.S. Department of
Commerce (“DOC”). On September 29, 2006, the DOC and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) signed a Joint Project Agreement to continue the transition of the coordination of the technical
functions relating to the management of the Internet Domain Name and Addressing System to the private sector.

As the exclusive registry of domain names within the

.com

and

.net

generic top-level domains (“gTLDs”), we have entered into
certain agreements with ICANN and the DOC:

Agreement and Amendment No. 30 of the Cooperative Agreement are qualified in their entirety by the text of
the complete agreements that are filed as exhibits to this report.

Security Services.

Some of our security services utilize and incorporate encryption technology. Exports of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the United
States and various non-United States governments. We have obtained approval to export many of the security services we provide to customers globally under applicable United States export law, including our server digital certificate services. As the
list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or changed, government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international
markets. If we do not obtain required approvals, we may not be able to sell some of our security services in international markets.

There are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certification authorities, but a limited number of states have enacted
legislation or regulations with respect to certification authorities. If we do not comply with these state laws and regulations, we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us. Moreover, if our market for
digital certificates grows, the United States federal, state, or foreign governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certification authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services. These
regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business.

Communications Services.

Our communications customers are subject to FCC regulation, which indirectly affects our
communications services business. We cannot predict when, or upon what terms and conditions, further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or deregulation on our business. Several services that we offer may be indirectly
affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services, which may increase our costs of operations. In addition, future services we may provide could be subject to direct government regulation.



Intellectual Property

We rely primarily on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks,
patents, restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property. We also enter into confidentiality and/or invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and current and potential affiliates, customers and
business partners. We also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information.

We have been issued numerous patents in the United States and abroad, covering a wide range of our technology. Additionally, we have filed numerous patent
applications with respect to certain of our technology in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices outside the United States. Patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded, such
patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property.

We have obtained trademark registrations for various VeriSign marks in the United States and other countries. We have also filed numerous applications to register VeriSign trademarks and claims, and have common law
rights in many other proprietary names. We take steps to enforce and police VeriSign’s marks.

With regard to our Security Services business, we also rely on certain licensed third-party technology, such as public key cryptography technology
licensed from RSA and other technology that is used in our security services to perform key functions. RSA has granted us a perpetual, royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide license to use RSA’s products relating to certificate issuing,
management and processing functionality. We develop services that contain or incorporate the RSA BSAFE products and that relate to digital certificate-issuing software, software for the management of private keys and for digitally signing computer
files on behalf of others, and software for customers to preview and forward digital certificate requests to them. RSA’s BSAFE product is a software tool kit that allows for the integration of encryption and authentication features into
software applications.

With regard to our Information Services
business, our principal intellectual property consists of, and our success is dependent upon, proprietary software used in our registry service business and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation
of our current and future registry services and Internet-based products and services businesses, including the conversion of internationalized domain names. We own our proprietary shared registration system through which competing registrars submit

.com

and

.net

second-level domain name registrations. Some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors.

With regard to our Communications Services Group, we offer a wide variety of
services, including network connectivity and interoperability, intelligent database, content and applications, and clearing and settlement services, each of which are protected by trade secret, patents and/or patent applications. We have also
entered into agreements with third-party providers and licensors, including third-party providers of content such as music, games and logos.

Employees

The following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function:



We have never had a work stoppage, and no U.S.-based employees are represented under collective
bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate highly
qualified sales, technical and managerial personnel, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry
and in some of our geographical locations is intense, particularly for software development personnel.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because
these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained in
this Form 10-K as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Note: The following risk factors are intended to be current as of the date of the filing of this report.

Our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are
uncertain.

Our operating results have varied in the past
and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. These factors include the following:

•

the long sales and implementation cycles for, and potentially large order sizes of, some of our security and communications services and the timing and execution of
individual customer contracts;

•

volume of domain name registrations and customer renewals in our naming services business;

•

the mix of all our services sold during a period;

•

our success in marketing and market acceptance of our services by our existing customers and by new customers;

•

changes in marketing expenses related to promoting and distributing our services;

•

customer renewal rates and turnover of customers of our services;

•

continued development of our direct and indirect distribution channels for our security services and communications services, both in the U.S. and abroad;

•

changes in the level of spending for information technology-related products and services by enterprise customers;

•

our success in assimilating the operations, products, services and personnel of any acquired businesses;

•

the timing and execution of individual customer contracts, particularly large contracts;

•

the impact of price changes in our communications services and security services or our competitors’ products and services;

•

the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R that will require us to record a charge to earnings for stock-based compensation; and

•

general economic and market conditions as well as economic and market conditions specific to the telecommunications and Internet industries.

Our operating expenses may increase. If an
increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues, our operating results will suffer, particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service, rather than
immediately when the customer pays for them, unlike our sales and marketing expenditures, which are expensed in full when incurred.



Due to all of the above
factors, our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future
performance. Also, operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods. If this were to occur, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.

Our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain
geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions.

Adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to downturns in the telecommunications and technology industries in the past and could impact our business in the future, resulting in:

•

reduced demand for our services as a result of a decrease in information technology and telecommunications spending by our customers;

•

increased price competition for our products and services; and

•

higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenues.

Recent political turmoil in many parts of the world, including terrorist and military actions, may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.
If the economic and market conditions in the United States and globally do not continue to improve, or if they deteriorate, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition as a consequence of
the above factors or otherwise.

Our limited operating history under our
current business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results.

We have acquired many companies, a number of which operated in different businesses from our then-current business. Therefore, we have only a limited
operating history on which to base an evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects. Our success will depend on many factors, many of which are not entirely under our control, including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the successful integration of acquired companies;

•

the use of the Internet and other Internet Protocol (“IP”) networks for electronic commerce and communications;

•

the extent to which digital certificates and domain names are used for electronic commerce or communications;

•

growth in the number of Web sites;

•

growth in wireless networks and communications;

•

growth in demand for our services;

•

the continued evolution of electronic and mobile commerce as a viable means of conducting business;

•

the competition for any of our services;

•

the perceived security of electronic commerce and communications over the Internet and other IP networks;

•

the perceived security of our services, technology, infrastructure and practices;

•

the significant lead times before a new product or service begins generating revenues;

•

the varying rates at which telecommunications companies, telephony resellers and Internet service providers use our services;

•

the success in marketing and overall demand for our content services to consumers and businesses;



•

the loss of customers through industry consolidation or customer decisions to deploy in-house or competitor technology and services; and

•

our continued ability to maintain our current, and enter into additional, strategic relationships.

To address these risks we must, among other things:

•

successfully market our services to new and existing customers;

•

attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

•

respond to competitive developments;

•

successfully introduce new services; and

•

successfully introduce enhancements to our services to address new technologies and standards and changing market conditions.

The internal review of our historical stock option granting practices, the restatement of
certain of our historical consolidated financial statements, investigations by the SEC and related events have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on us.

The Ad Hoc Group of independent directors of the Board of Directors conducted a review of our historical stock option
granting practices for the period January 1998 through May 2006. During the course of the review, the Ad Hoc Group identified stock option grants with incorrect measurement dates, without required documentation, or with initial grant dates and
exercise prices that were subsequently modified. Consequently, we have recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option grants. In this Form 10-K, we are restating our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We are restating the unaudited quarterly
financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and the unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Details of the restatement and its underlying circumstances are discussed in
the Explanatory Note in Note 2 “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this report.

As a result of the events described above, we have become subject to a number of significant risks, each of which could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:

•

we are subject to significant pending civil litigation, including shareholder class action lawsuits and derivative claims made on behalf of us, the defense of which
will require us to devote significant management attention and to incur significant legal expense and which litigation, if decided against us, could require us to pay substantial judgments, settlements or other penalties;

•

we are subject to a continuing formal order of investigation from the SEC and a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California
which could require significant management time and attention and cause us to incur significant accounting and legal expense and which could require us to pay substantial fines or other penalties;

•

we are subject to the risk of additional litigation and regulatory proceedings or actions; and

•

many members of our senior management team and our Board of Directors have been and will be required to devote a significant amount of time on matters relating to
the continuing formal order of investigation from the SEC and a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, remedial efforts and related litigation.



We have identified a material weakness in
our internal controls over financial reporting that could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and result in a decrease in the value of our securities.

Our management has identified a material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 arising from a combination of internal control deficiencies in our stock administration policies and practices, as discussed in “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting” in Item 9A. In addition, due to the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2006 our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

We will
continue to evaluate, upgrade and enhance our internal controls. Because of inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, errors or omissions, and any projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate. We cannot be certain
in future periods that other control deficiencies that may constitute one or more “significant deficiencies” (as defined by the relevant auditing standards) or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not
be identified. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls, our business and results of operations could be harmed, the results of
operations we report could be subject to adjustments, we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls or meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material
adverse effect on the price of our securities.

Through the
twelve-month period ended December 31, 2006, we expended significant resources in connection with the Section 404 process. In future periods, we will likely continue to expend substantial amounts in connection with the Section 404
process and with ongoing evaluation of, and improvements and enhancements to, our internal control over financial reporting. These expenditures may make it difficult for us to control or reduce the growth of our general and administrative and other
expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our securities.

If our cost reduction and restructuring efforts are ineffective, our revenues and profitability may be hurt.

In the first quarter of 2007, we have undertaken various cost reduction and restructuring activities that replaced our previous business unit structure
with a functional organization consisting of a combined worldwide sales and services team and an integrated marketing and product development organization. The restructuring, impairment and other charges are estimated to be approximately $26.9
million in the first quarter of 2007; however, if we incur additional restructuring-related charges, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In addition, the cost reduction and restructuring activities may not produce the full
efficiencies and benefits we expect or the efficiencies and benefits might be delayed. There can be no assurance that these efforts, as well as any potential future cost reduction and restructuring activities, will not adversely affect our business,
operations or customer perceptions, or result in additional future charges. In addition, we have recently experienced changes in our management, which together with these cost reduction and restructuring activities, could also cause our remaining
employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our remaining employees, which in turn may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future.

We have faced difficulties assimilating, and may incur costs associated with, acquisitions and dispositions.

We made numerous acquisitions and dispositions in the last six years and
will pursue additional acquisitions and dispositions in the future. We have experienced difficulty in, and in the future may face difficulties, integrating the personnel, products, technologies or operations of companies or businesses we acquire or
divest. Assimilating acquired businesses and dispositions involve a number of other risks, including, but not limited to:

•

the potential disruption of our ongoing business;



•

the potential impairment of relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners;

•

the need to manage more geographically-dispersed operations, such as our offices in the states of Georgia, Kansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island,
Texas, Virginia, and Washington, and globally in Australia, Europe, India, Japan, South Africa and South America;

•

greater than expected costs and/or lower than expected revenues and the assumption of unknown liabilities;

•

the diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses in identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions;

•

the inability to retain the key employees of the acquired businesses;

•

adverse effects on the existing customer relationships of acquired companies;

•

the inability to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our operations infrastructure;

•

the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;

•

the potential incompatibility of business cultures;

•

additional regulatory requirements;

•

any perceived adverse changes in business focus;

•

entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience;

•

the need to incur debt, which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, or issue equity securities, which may dilute the ownership interests of
our existing stockholders; and

•

the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies.

If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future acquisitions and dispositions, our business could be
harmed.

Additionally, there is risk that we may incur
additional expenses associated with an impairment of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions for acquisitions and dispositions. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to evaluate
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and to evaluate other intangible assets as events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired. These evaluations could result in further impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.

We may not realize the benefits we are seeking from our investments in the
Jamba joint ventures as a result of lower than predicted operating results, larger funding requirements or lower cash distributions or otherwise.

We have a 49% equity interest in two joint ventures related to our former Jamba business. We will incur our proportionate share of the income or losses of
these joint ventures in our consolidated statements of income. We do not have control over the budget, day-to-day management or many of the other operating expenditures of the joint ventures, and therefore, we cannot predict with certainty the
extent of the impact on our financial statements of these joint ventures for any particular period. Accordingly, our share of the income or losses of these joint ventures could materially affect our results of operations in future periods.

The joint venture agreements contain provisions requiring
minimum cash distributions to the members. However, these provisions are subject to conditions and limitations, and therefore, we cannot assure you that we will ever receive cash distributions from these joint ventures. If the joint ventures require
capital to fund their operations, we could be required to make capital contributions or loans to the joint ventures. The business operated by the U.S. joint venture is a newer business and therefore it may be more likely to require additional
funding, although we cannot assure that the Netherlands joint venture will not require additional funding as well.



If the Netherlands joint venture makes cash distributions to its members, to the extent we seek to use the cash in the U.S., we would be required to pay
taxes on those funds if they are brought to the U.S., and therefore we would not receive the full benefit of any cash distribution. Additionally, we could be required to pay additional amounts to the joint ventures if it is later determined that we
breached any of the representations of warranties in the formation agreement for the joint ventures.

The value of our investment in these joint ventures is subject to general economic, technological and market trends, as well as to the operating and
financial decisions of the management team of the joint venture, all of which are outside of our control. In addition, these joint ventures may not gain the expected number of customers and/or generate the expected level of revenues, and
consequently, we may never receive any cash distributions from these joint ventures, and in fact, they may require additional funding, any of which could diminish the value of or dilute our investment. Our investments in these joint ventures may not
provide the economic returns we are seeking and may not increase in value above the minimum amounts that we can require Fox or News Corporation to buy our shares from us. We cannot assure you that the commercial agreements, including the Gateway
Services Agreement, will provide us any benefit. It is also possible that Fox and News Corporation could purchase our shares from us in the future, prior to the businesses of the joint ventures reaching their full potential. Therefore, we cannot
provide you with any assurance as to whether we will achieve a favorable return on our investment.

We also entered into various other commercial relationships with the joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you we will derive significant revenues
from these other relationships.

The expansion of our international
operations subjects our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business.

We intend to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. For example, we expect to expand our operations and
marketing activities throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America and South America. We have approximately 1,870 employees outside the United States. Expansion in these international markets has required and will continue to require significant management
attention and resources. We may also need to tailor some of our other services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships. We have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing
international distribution or operating relationships. We may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets. Failure to do so could harm our business. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from
those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States regulations
applicable to us. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors or agents could result in financial
reporting problems, fines, penalties, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there are risks inherent in doing business on an international basis,
including, among others:

•

competition with foreign companies or other domestic companies entering the foreign markets in which we operate;

•

differing and uncertain regulatory requirements;

•

legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with foreign laws;

•

export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

longer sales and payment cycles;



•

problems in collecting accounts receivable;

•

currency fluctuations, as our international revenues from Europe, South Africa, Japan, South America and Australia are not denominated in U.S. Dollars;

•

potential problems associated with adapting our services to technical conditions existing in different countries;

•

the necessity of developing foreign language portals and products for our services;

•

difficulty of authenticating customer information for digital certificates and other purposes;

•

political instability;

•

failure of foreign laws to protect our U.S. proprietary rights adequately;

•

more stringent privacy policies in foreign countries;

•

additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting U.S. interests abroad;

•

seasonal reductions in business activity; and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

Our failure to manage past and future growth in our business could harm our business.

Between December 31, 1995 and December 31, 2006, we grew from 26 to 5,331 employees. This was achieved through
internal growth, as well as acquisitions. During this time period, we opened new sales offices and significantly expanded our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. To successfully manage past growth and any future growth, we will need to continue to
implement additional management information systems, continue the development of our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our executive, engineering, accounting, finance,
marketing, sales and operations organizations. Any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business.

The business environment is highly competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, we may suffer price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.

Competition in Security
Services

.    Our security services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for Internet security services, including network security, authentication and validation, which enable secure electronic commerce and
communications over wireline and wireless IP networks. The market for security services is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry
participants.

Principal competitors generally fall within one
of the following categories: (1) companies such as RSA Security, Inc. and Entrust Technologies, which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves; (2) companies such as Digital
Signature Trust Company (a subsidiary of Identrus) that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authority related services; (3) companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as CyberTrust; and
(4) companies offering competing SSL certificate and other security services, including GoDaddy and other domain name registrars. We also experience competition from a number of smaller companies, and we believe that our primary long-term
competitors may not yet have entered the market. Furthermore, Netscape and Microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates, and we believe that other companies could introduce similar
products.

In addition, browser companies that embed our
interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their Web browsers or on their Web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future.



Competition in Managed
Security Services

.    Consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with Internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services. These companies include large
systems integrators and consulting firms, such as Accenture, IBM Global Services, Getronics and Lucent NetCare. We also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services, such as
Symantec and ISS, as well as a number of providers such as CyberTrust and BT Counterpane that offer managed security services. Telecommunications providers, such as Verizon Business, a provider of managed security services, are also potential
competitors. In addition, we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of IP addresses and name maps throughout enterprise-wide intranets, and with companies with internally developed systems integration
efforts.

Competition in Communications
Services.

The market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure. Competition in this area arises from two primary sources. Incumbent carriers provide competing in-house
services in their respective regions. In addition, we face direct competition from national, unregulated companies, including Syniverse Technologies, Telcordia, NeuStar and other carriers such as Southern New England Telephone Diversified Group, a
unit of AT&T. Furthermore, customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third-party providers, such as VeriSign, and
further increase competitive pricing pressures.

Competition
in Commerce Services

.    Our wireless billing and payment services are also subject to competition from providers such as Comverse, Amdocs, Convergys Corporation and Boston Communications Group. We are also aware of major
Internet service providers, software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are or may in the future be focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that may compete directly with ours. Furthermore,
customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third-party providers such as VeriSign and further increase competitive pricing
pressures.

Competition in Content Services.

The market for content services is extremely competitive. Competitors include developers of content and entertainment products and services in a variety of domestic and
international markets, such as Infospace, Itouch, Arvato mobile, Monstermob, and Motricity This business also faces competition from mobile network operators such as Cingular, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corporation, T-Mobile, Vodafone,

, Orange, E-Plus and Telefónica, as well as Internet portal operators such as Yahoo!, AOL, T-Online and
Google. Additional competitors are handset manufacturers such as Nokia and software providers such as Microsoft and Apple. As the market for wireless data, including information and entertainment data, matures, new categories of competitors, such as
mobile phone companies, broadcasters, music publishers, other content providers or others have begun to develop competing products or services.

Competition in Naming Services.

We face competition in the domain name registry space from other gTLD and ccTLD registries
that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a Web presence, including registries offering services related to the .

mobi

, .

biz

,

.name, .pro, .aero, .museum

and

.coop

gTLDs
and registries offering services related to ccTLDs. There are currently 16 gTLD registries and over 240 ccTLD registries.

We also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration, resolutions and other DNS services to organizations that
require a reliable and scalable infrastructure. Among the competitors are UltraDNS, NeuLevel, Affilias, Register.com and Tucows.com.

Competition in Intelligent Supply Chain Services.

There are a number of companies that provide intelligent supply chain
services. For point-of-sale data, we face competition from IRI and AC Nielsen, as well as smaller software companies. For consulting services, we face competition from traditional consulting firms.



Competition in Real-Time Publisher Services

.    We face competition from
various smaller companies providing similar services.

Competition in Digital Brand Management Services.

We face competition from companies providing services similar to some of our Digital Brand Management Services. In the monitoring services, registration and
domain name asset management area of our business, our competition comes primarily from ICANN accredited registrars and various smaller companies providing similar services.

Several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial,
technical, marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and
more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means. If such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers, the
demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished. New technologies and the expansion of existing
technologies may increase the competitive pressure.

New
technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure. We cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive
position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors. The existence or announcement of any such
relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors, and competitive pressures that we face
could materially harm our business.

Our communications services business
depends in part on the acceptance of our SS7 network and the telecommunications industry’s continuing use of SS7 technology.

Our future growth in our communications services business depends, in part, on the commercial success and reliability of our SS7 network. Our SS7 network
is a vital component of our intelligent network services and has been a significant source of revenues for our Communications Services Group. Our communications services business will suffer if our target customers do not use our SS7 network. Our
future financial performance will also depend on the successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced SS7-based services. We are not certain that our target customers will choose our particular SS7 network solution or
continue to use our SS7 network. In the future, we may not be successful in marketing our SS7 network or any new or enhanced services.

The inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our business.

Significant technical challenges exist in our signaling
and network services business because many of our customers:

•

purchase and implement SS7 network services in phases;

•

deploy SS7 connectivity across a variety of telecommunication switches and routes; and

•

integrate our SS7 network with a number of legacy systems, third-party software applications and engineering tools.

Customer implementation currently requires participation by our order
management and our engineering and operations groups, each of which has limited resources. Some customers may also require us to develop



costly customized features or capabilities, which increases our costs and consumes a disproportionate share of our limited customer service and support
resources. Also, we typically charge one-time fees for initially connecting a customer to our SS7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the connection is established. If new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products
or require significant amounts of our engineering service support, we may experience reduced operating margins. Our customers’ ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and integrate them successfully within their systems
depends on our customers’ capabilities and the complexity involved. Difficulty in deploying those services could reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause potential delays in recognizing revenues until the
services are implemented.

Our failure to achieve or sustain market
acceptance of our communications services at desired pricing levels and industry consolidation could adversely impact our revenues and cash flow.

The telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price competition. Competition and industry consolidation in our communications services
could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion of our market share. Pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in the selling price of our services. For example, our competitors may provide customers with reduced
communications costs for Internet access or private network services, reducing the overall cost of services and significantly increasing pricing pressures on us. We would need to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of
our customers, generating higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs, and we may not be able to do so successfully. We believe that the business of providing network connectivity and related network services will see increased
consolidation in the future. Consolidation could decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries, which could erode our market share, revenues and operating margins in our Communications Services Group. Consolidation in the
telecommunications industry has led to the merging of many companies, including AT&T Wireless, MCI, Nextel and Price Communications, customers of our Communications Services Group. Our business could be harmed if these mergers result in the loss
of customers by our Communications Services Group. Furthermore, customers may choose to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services thereby reducing the demand for technologies and services we offer which could harm our
business.

Our content services business depends on agreements with many
different third parties, including wireless carriers and content providers. If these agreements are terminated or not renewed, or are amended to require us to change the way our content services are offered to customers, our business could be
harmed.

Our content services business depends on our
ability to enter into and maintain agreements with many different third parties including wireless carriers and other mobile phone service providers, upon which this business is highly dependent for billing its customers.

These agreements are typically for a short term, or are otherwise terminable
upon short notice, and in the case of agreements with carriers, other mobile phone service providers and content developers, are non-exclusive. If these third parties reduce their commitment to us, terminate their agreements with us or enter into
similar agreements with our competitors, our content services business could be materially harmed.

Our business depends on the continued growth of the Internet and adoption and continued use of IP networks.

Our future success depends, in part, on continued growth in the use of the Internet and IP networks. If the use of, and interest in, the Internet and IP
networks does not grow, our business would be harmed. To date, many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the Internet and IP networks for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:

•

potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure;

•

security concerns, particularly for online commerce, including the potential for merchant or user impersonation and fraud or theft of stored data and information
communicated over IP networks;



•

privacy concerns, including the potential for third parties to obtain personally identifiable information about users or to disclose or sell data without notice to
or the consent of such users;

•

other security concerns such as attacks on popular Web sites by “hackers”;

•

inconsistent quality of service;

•

inability to integrate business applications on IP networks;

•

the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products;

•

limited bandwidth access; and

•

government regulation.

The widespread acceptance of the Internet and IP networks will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging
information. Organizations that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods. Also, individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting
payments may be reluctant to change.

A number of states, as
well as the U.S. Congress, have been considering various initiatives that could permit sales and use taxes on Internet sales. If any of these initiatives are adopted, it could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and therefore
hinder the growth in the use of the Internet and IP networks, which could harm our business.

Many of our target markets are evolving, and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets, our business could suffer.

We target our security services at the market for trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications over IP and other networks. Our Information Services business unit is developing managed services designed to work with the EPCglobal Network and radio frequency identification (“RFID”), technology,
point-of-sale data services and real-time publisher services. These are rapidly evolving markets that may not continue to grow. Even if these markets grow, our services may not be widely accepted. Accordingly, the demand for our services is very
uncertain. The factors that may affect market acceptance of our services include the following:

•

market acceptance of products and services based upon technologies other than those we use;

•

public perception of the security of our technologies and of IP and other networks;

•

the introduction and consumer acceptance of new generations of mobile handsets;

•

demand for supply chain information services, including acceptance of RFID technology, the EPCglobal Network and point-of-sale data services;

•

the ability of the Internet infrastructure to accommodate increased levels of usage; and

•

government regulations affecting electronic commerce and communications over IP networks.

If the market for electronic commerce and communications over IP and other
networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market, our business would be materially harmed.

Governmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth, increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability.

The growth and development of the Internet has led to new
laws and regulations, as well as the application of existing laws to the Internet and wireless communications. Application of these laws can be unclear. The costs of complying or failure to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our
ability to operate in our



markets, expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and time-consuming litigation.

Foreign, federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business.
For example, recent laws include those designed to restrict the on-line distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions or obligations for on-line services when dealing with minors. Such legislation
may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities.

Due to the nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate Internet
transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for
us, force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business.

Our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business.

The emerging nature of the Internet, other communication networks, content, digital certificate, and domain name
registration markets, and their rapid evolution, require us continually to improve the performance, features and reliability of our services, particularly in response to competitive offerings. In particular, the market for entertainment and
information is characterized by changing technology, developing industry standards, changing customer preferences and trends (which also vary from country to country), and the constant introduction of new products and services. In order to remain
competitive, we must continually improve our access technology and software, support the latest transmission technologies, and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and customer preferences. When entertainment products are
placed on the market, it is difficult to predict whether they will become popular.

The communications network services industry is also characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements. Significant technological changes could make our technologies
obsolete and other changes in our markets could result in some of our other products and services losing market share. Accordingly, we must continually improve the responsiveness, reliability and features of our services and develop new features,
services and applications to meet changing customer needs in our target markets. For example, we sell our SS7 network services primarily to traditional telecommunications companies that rely on traditional voice networks. Many emerging companies are
providing convergent Internet protocol-based network services. Our future success could also depend upon our ability to provide products and services to these Internet protocol-based telephony providers, particularly if IP-based telephony becomes
widely accepted. We cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost-effective way to adequately meet them. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers
or market share.

New products and services developed or introduced by us
may not result in any significant revenues.

We must
commit significant resources to develop new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including
proper new definition and timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. For example, our selection in January 2004 by EPCglobal, a not-for-profit standards organization, to operate the Object Naming Service as the root directory for the
EPCglobal Network, may not increase our revenues in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner,
or achieve market acceptance of our products and services, or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our inability to successfully market new
products and services may harm our business.



Issues arising from our agreements with ICANN and the Department of Commerce could harm our registry business.

The U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) has
adopted a plan for the phased transition of the DOC’s responsibilities for the domain name system to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”). As part of this transition, as the exclusive registry of domain
names within the .

com

and .

net

generic top-level domains (“gTLDs”), we have entered into agreements with ICANN and with the DOC as described elsewhere in this report.

We face risks from the transition of the DOC’s responsibilities for the
domain name system to ICANN, including the following:

•

ICANN could adopt or promote policies, procedures or programs that are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of the

.com

and

.net

gTLDs or that
are inconsistent with our current or future plans;

•

the DOC or ICANN could terminate our agreements to be the registry for the

.com

or

.net

gTLDs under the circumstances described elsewhere in this
report;

•

if the .

com

and .

net

Registry Agreements are terminated, it could have a material adverse impact on our business;

•

the DOC’s or ICANN’s interpretation of provisions of our agreements with either of them could differ from ours;

•

the DOC could revoke its recognition of ICANN, as a result of which the DOC could take the place of ICANN for purposes of our agreements with ICANN, and could take
actions that are harmful to us;

•

the U.S. Government could refuse to transfer certain responsibilities for domain name system administration to ICANN due to security, stability or other reasons,
resulting in fragmentation or other instability in domain name system administration; and

•

our registry business could face legal or other challenges resulting from our activities or the activities of registrars.

Challenges to ongoing privatization of Internet administration could harm our domain name
registry business.

Risks we face from challenges by third
parties, including governmental authorities in the United States and other countries, to our role in the ongoing privatization of the Internet include:

•

legal, regulatory or other challenges could be brought, including challenges to the agreements governing our relationship with the DOC or ICANN, or to the legal
authority underlying the roles and actions of the DOC, ICANN or us;

•

the U.S. Congress could take action that is unfavorable to us;

•

ICANN could fail to maintain its role, potentially resulting in instability in domain name system administration; and

•

some governments and governmental authorities outside the U.S. have in the past disagreed with, and may in the future disagree with, the actions, policies or
programs of ICANN, the U.S. Government and us relating to the domain name system. These foreign governments or governmental authorities may take actions or adopt policies or programs that are harmful to our business.

As a result of these and other risks, it may be difficult for us to introduce
new services in our domain name registry business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted.



If we encounter system interruptions, we
could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer.

We depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems, secure data centers and other computer and communication networks. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

•

power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures;

•

damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, and other natural disasters;

•

computer viruses or software defects; and

•

physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.

Most of our systems are located at, and most of our customer information is
stored in, our facilities in Mountain View, California and Kawasaki, Japan, both of which are susceptible to earthquakes; Providence, Rhode Island; Dulles, Virginia; Lacey, Washington; Overland Park, Kansas, Melbourne, Australia and Berlin, Hamburg
and Verl, Germany. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business
interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism.

In addition, our ability to issue digital certificates, our domain name registry services and other of our services depend on the efficient operation of
the Internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system. These connections depend upon the efficient operation of Internet service providers and Internet backbone service providers,
all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past.

A failure in the operation of our domain name zone servers, the domain name root servers, or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the Internet for a period of time. A failure in
the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time. A failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain
could result in the deletion of one or more top-level domains from the Internet and the discontinuation of second-level domain names in those top-level domains for a period of time. Any of these problems or outages could decrease customer
satisfaction, which could harm our business.

If we experience security
breaches, we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer.

We retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems. It is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are
perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against
interruption, and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system. The root zone servers and top-level domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations.
Therefore, we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure.

Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar disruptive
problems. It is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems. Any physical or electronic break-in or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers
and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers. In such an event, we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant
to use our



services. Such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of electronic
commerce and communications over IP networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services.

The reliance of our network connectivity and interoperability services and content services on third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control.

The success of our network connectivity and
interoperability services and content services depends on our network infrastructure, including the capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers. In particular, we rely on AT&T, MCI, Sprint and other telecommunications providers for leased
long-haul and local loop transmission capacity. These companies provide the dedicated links that connect our network components to each other and to our customers. Our business also depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of the
infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect telephone calls. Specifically, we currently lease capacity from regional providers on four of the fourteen mated pairs of SS7 signal transfer points that comprise our network.

We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a
significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. We depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections. If one or more of these companies is
unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future, our operations could be severely interrupted. In addition, rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies. These mergers
may cause the availability, pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services that we use to increase significantly.

Our signaling and SS7 services rely on links, equipment and software provided to us from our vendors, the most important of
which are gateway equipment and software from Tekelec and Agilent Technologies, Inc. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to maintain current
purchasing terms or ensure product availability with these vendors, we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products and services.

Capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and
upgrade our systems to meet increased use.

If traffic
from our telecommunication and content customers through our network increases, we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software. We may not be able to expand and upgrade, in a timely manner, our systems and
network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network. If we do not appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software, we may lose customers and revenues.

We rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route Internet
communications.

We currently administer and operate only
two of the thirteen root zone servers. The others are administered and operated by independent operators on a volunteer basis. Because of the importance to the functioning of the Internet of these root zone servers, our registry services business
could be harmed if these volunteer operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers, which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate.

Further, our registry services business could be harmed if any of these
volunteer operators fail to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls. In the event and to the extent that ICANN is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server
system, as provided in our registry agreement with ICANN, it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the top-level domain zone servers designated by us. If ICANN does not do this, our business could be harmed.



Undetected or unknown defects in our
services could harm our business and future operating results.

Services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain undetected defects or errors. Despite testing, defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services, which could result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of
market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, tort or warranty claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. The
performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third-party applications and services that utilize our services, which could result in legal claims against us,
harming our business. Furthermore, we often provide implementation, customization, consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services, which typically involves working with
sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance,
injury to our reputation and increased costs.

Services offered by our
Internet Services Group rely on public key cryptography technology that may compromise our system’s security.

Services offered by our Internet Services Group depend on public key cryptography technology. With public key cryptography technology, a user is given a
public key and a private key, both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and that it is not lost, stolen or otherwise
compromised. The integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as “factoring.” This integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their
prime number components is difficult. Should an easy factoring method be developed, the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, any significant advance in techniques
for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing PKI services obsolete or unmarketable. If improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed, we would likely have to reissue digital
certificates to some or all of our customers, which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business. In the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths
and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data. This type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates. This
negative public perception could harm our business.

Some of our security
services have lengthy sales and implementation cycles.

We
market many of our security services directly to large companies and government agencies and we market our communications services to large telecommunication carriers. The sale and implementation of our services to these entities typically involves
a lengthy education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources. This process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers’ internal budgeting and other procedures for
approving large capital expenditures, deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations. As a result, the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain of our services
can be lengthy, potentially lasting from three to nine months. Our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized.

Failure of VeriSign Affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain
the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business.

We have licensed to VeriSign Affiliates our Processing Center platform, which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the VeriSign
Affiliate to offer back-end processing of PKI services for enterprises. The VeriSign Processing Center platform provides a VeriSign Affiliate with the knowledge and



technology to offer PKI services similar to those offered by us. It is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in
issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although we provide the VeriSign Affiliate with training in security and trust practices, network management and customer service and
support, these practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control. Any failure of a VeriSign Affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and therefore
adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over IP networks generally.

We rely on our intellectual property, and any failure by us to protect, or any misappropriation of, our intellectual property could harm
our business.

Our success depends on our internally
developed technologies, patents and other intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization.
Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent U.S. law protects these rights in the United States. In addition, it is possible that others may independently develop
substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer. In the future, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our
trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This type of litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources.

We also license third-party technology that is used in our products and
services to perform key functions. These third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies. A third-party
could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right. Litigation between the licensor and a third-party or between us and a third-party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which
indemnification is insufficient, or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or our inability to obtain or maintain, any of these technology licenses could delay the introduction of
our Internet infrastructure services until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. This could harm our business.

We could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others, which could be costly to defend and which could harm our business.

Claims relating to infringement of intellectual property
of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future. In addition, we use news content as part of our real-time publisher service. It is possible that we could become subject to
additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause delays or require us
to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us, we
could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined. If we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business could be harmed.

In addition, legal standards relating to the validity,
enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. Because of the growth of the Internet and Internet-related businesses, patent applications are continuously and
simultaneously being filed in connection with Internet-related technology. There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest, and we believe that there has been, and is likely to continue to
be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.



We must establish and maintain strategic
and other relationships.

One of our significant business
strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts. We may need to enter into additional relationships
to execute our business plan. We may not be able to enter into additional, or maintain our existing, strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms. If we fail to enter into additional relationships, we would have to devote substantially
more resources to the distribution, sale and marketing of our security services and communications services than we would otherwise.

Our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the
ability of these parties to market our services successfully.

Furthermore, our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple distribution channels. Failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result
in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business. If we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships, this could harm our business.

We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in
attracting and retaining such personnel.

We depend on the
performance of our senior management team and other key employees. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel,
both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, our stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel, which consist of background checks into prospective employees’ criminal and financial histories, further limit the number of qualified
persons for these positions.

We have no employment agreements
with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving VeriSign at any time. In addition, we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees. The loss of the services of any of our senior management team or
other key employees or failure to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business.

Compliance with rules and regulations concerning corporate governance is costly and could harm our business.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates, among other things, that companies adopt
new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for
companies, their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their
internal controls. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance. These laws, rules and regulations have increased the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate
governance, reporting and disclosure practices, and our compliance efforts have required significant management attention. It has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we have been
required to accept reduced coverage and incur substantially higher costs to obtain the reduced level of coverage. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in
connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business.



We have anti-takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders.

Our amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:

•

our stockholders may take action only at a meeting and not by written consent;

•

our board must be given advance notice regarding stockholder-sponsored proposals for consideration at annual meetings and for stockholder nominations for the
election of directors;

•

we currently have a classified Board of Directors, with the board being currently divided into three classes that serve staggered three-year terms, although we
intend to declassify our board commencing in connection with our 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;

•

vacancies on our board may be filled until the next annual meeting of stockholders only by majority vote of the directors then in office; and

•

special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the president or the board, and not by our stockholders.

VeriSign has also adopted a stockholder
rights plan that may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult. Under the rights plan:

•

The rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the plan, including the acquisition of 20% of VeriSign’s outstanding
common stock by a person or group.

•

Each right entitles the holder, other than an “acquiring person,” to acquire shares of VeriSign’s common stock at a 50% discount to the
then-prevailing market price.

•

VeriSign’s Board of Directors may redeem outstanding rights at any time prior to a person becoming an “acquiring person,” at a price of $0.001 per
right. Prior to such time, the terms of the rights may be amended by VeriSign’s Board of Directors without the approval of the holders of the rights.

Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous
foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
We are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical
income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Note: The following description of pending legal proceedings is intended to be current as of June 30, 2007.

On September 7, 2001, NetMoneyIN, an Arizona corporation, filed a complaint alleging patent infringement against VeriSign and several other
previously-named defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona asserting infringement of U.S. patent Nos. 5,822,737 and 5,963,917. NetMoneyIN amended its complaint on October 15, 2002, alleging infringement by
VeriSign and several other defendants of a third U.S. patent (No. 6,381,584) in addition to the two patents previously asserted. On August 27, 2003, NetMoneyIN filed a third amended complaint alleging direct infringement of the same three
patents by VeriSign and several other previously-named defendants. NetMoneyIN dropped its claim of active inducement of infringement by VeriSign. Some of the other current defendants include IBM, BA Merchant Services, Wells Fargo Bank, Cardservice
International, InfoSpace, E-Commerce Exchange and Paymentech. VeriSign filed an answer denying any infringement and asserting that the three asserted patents are invalid and later filed an amended answer asserting, in addition, that the asserted
patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The complaint alleged that VeriSign’s Payflow payment products and services directly infringe certain claims of NetMoneyIN’s three patents
and requested the Court to enter judgment in favor of NetMoneyIN, a permanent injunction against the defendants’ alleged infringing activities, an order requiring defendants to provide an accounting for NetMoneyIN’s damages, to pay
NetMoneyIN such damages and three times that amount for any willful infringers, and an order awarding NetMoneyIN attorney fees and costs. NetMoneyIN has withdrawn its allegations of infringement of the ‘584 patent and the Court has dismissed
with prejudice all claims of infringement of the ‘584 patent. In its ruling on the claim construction issues, the Court found four of the five claims asserted against VeriSign, claims 1, 13 and 14 of the ‘737 patent and claim 1 of the
‘917 patent, invalid. NetMoneyIN may file an appeal after a final judgment seeking to overturn this ruling. Thus, only claim 23 of the ‘737 patent remains in the case. The Court granted the defendants’ motion to strike certain of the
Plaintiff’s assertions of infringement, including all charges of infringement under the so-called “doctrine of equivalents.” The Court recently granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment of no inducement and no
contributory infringement. Fact and expert witness discovery are completed. On September 29, 2006, VeriSign filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on Non-Infringement. On October 20, 2006, VeriSign filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on
Invalidity. On November 1, 2006, NetMoneyIN filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on Infringement. On July 9, 2007, the Court is scheduled to hear oral argument on the pending motions for summary judgment. While we cannot predict the outcome
of this lawsuit, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

Beginning in May of 2002, several class action complaints were filed against VeriSign and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. These actions were consolidated under the heading In re VeriSign, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. C-02-2270 JW (HRL), on July 26, 2002. The consolidated action seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a class of persons who purchased VeriSign stock from January 25, 2001 through April 25, 2002. An amended consolidated complaint was
filed on November 8, 2002. On April 14, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended and consolidated complaint. On May 5, 2004, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint
that was substantially identical to the amended consolidated complaint except that it purported to add a claim under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of a subclass of persons who acquired shares of VeriSign
pursuant to the registration statement and prospectus filed October 10, 2001 and amended October 26, 2001 for the acquisition of Illuminet Holdings, Inc. by VeriSign.
Plaintiffs’ second amended class action complaint was dismissed by the court on November 2, 2005 for failure to adequately plead loss causation. Plaintiffs were given leave to file an amended
complaint. Plaintiffs filed a third amended class action Complaint on December 22, 2005. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On April 6, 2006, that motion was granted in part
and denied in part. Plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint on May 12, 2006. Plaintiffs’ request for reconsideration of the April 6, 2006 order was granted on June 5, 2006. Plaintiffs filed a fifth amended complaint on
June 30, 2006. VeriSign moved to dismiss the fifth amended complaint. Parallel derivative actions have also



been filed against certain of VeriSign’s current and former officers and directors in state courts in California and Delaware. VeriSign is named as a
nominal defendant in these actions. Several of these derivative actions were filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court of California and these actions have since been consolidated under the heading In re VeriSign, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case
No. CV 807719.

The consolidated derivative action seeks
unspecified damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the California Corporations Code. Defendants’ demurrer to these claims was granted with leave to amend on February 4, 2003. Plaintiffs have indicated their
intention to file an amended complaint. Another derivative action was filed in the Court of Chancery New Castle County, Delaware, Case No. 19700-NC, alleging similar breaches of fiduciary duty. Defendants’ motion to dismiss these claims
was granted by the Court of Chancery with prejudice on September 30, 2003.

On April 24, 2007, the District Court entered Final Judgment and Order dismissing the Securities Litigation with prejudice based on final approval of the parties settlement of the Securities Litigation and the
Derivative Litigation. On May 15, 2007, the State Court entered a final Stipulation and Proposed of Dismissal with Prejudice of the Derivative Litigation. Under the terms of the settlement, liability insurers for the Company and its directors
and officers paid $80 million in settlement of the lawsuits, within applicable insurance limits. The time for appeal in both matters has now passed.

On August 27, 2004, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN in the Superior Court of the State of California Los Angeles County. The lawsuit alleges
that ICANN breached its

.com

Registry Agreement with VeriSign, including, without limitation, by overstepping its contractual authority and improperly attempting to regulate our business. The complaint seeks, among other things, specific
performance of the

.com

Registry Agreement, an injunction prohibiting ICANN from improperly regulating VeriSign, and monetary damages. On November 12, 2004, ICANN filed an answer denying VeriSign’s claims and a cross-complaint
against VeriSign for declaratory relief and breach of the .com Registry Agreement, alleging that VeriSign’s introduction of new services breached the .com Agreement. ICANN seeks a declaration from the court that it has acted in compliance with
the parties’ contractual obligations with regard to the .com registry; that VeriSign has breached the parties’ agreement through VeriSign’s actions with respect to, among other things, SiteFinder; and that ICANN has the right to
terminate the

.com

registry agreement if VeriSign offers “Registry Services” without ICANN’s approval, including among others SiteFinder. On December 28, 2004, VeriSign filed an answer denying the claims in ICANN’s
cross-complaint and a cross-complaint against ICANN for breach of contract, violation of the unfair competition laws, and declaratory relief, alleging, among other things, that ICANN’s accreditation of “thread” registrars is improper
and causes direct injury to VeriSign. On February 14, 2005, ICANN filed an answer to VeriSign’s cross-complaint denying VeriSign’s allegations.

On or about November 12, 2004, ICANN filed a Request for Arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of
Arbitration (the “ICC”) alleging that VeriSign violated its 2001

.net

Registry Agreement with ICANN when, among other things, VeriSign operated the SiteFinder service without ICANN approval. ICANN seeks a declaration from the ICC
that it has acted in compliance with the parties’ contractual obligations with regard to the .net registry; that VeriSign has breached the parties’ agreement through VeriSign’s actions with respect to, among other things, SiteFinder;
and that ICANN has the right to terminate the .net registry agreement if VeriSign offers “Registry Services” without ICANN’s approval, including among others SiteFinder. ICANN also seeks a declaration that, in evaluating
VeriSign’s bid to become the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain after the term of the 2001 agreement expires on or about June 30, 2005, ICANN is entitled to consider VeriSign’s alleged breaches of
the existing agreement. VeriSign cannot predict the outcome of this action or the affect this lawsuit will have on our relationship with ICANN.

On January 18, 2005, VeriSign filed a request for arbitration before the ICC against ICANN regarding the process by which ICANN solicited and
reviewed bids from companies, including VeriSign, to become the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain after the 2001 Registry Agreement expired on or about June 30, 2005. VeriSign alleges that the “request
for proposal” (“RFP”) process constitutes a breach of the 2001



.net registry agreement because, among other things, the RFP process fails to constitute an open and transparent process by which ICANN can reasonably select
the best qualified successor to operate the .net registry and does not constitute a valid “consensus policy” as defined in the 2001 .net agreement. ICANN has not yet responded to our arbitration request. On June 8, 2005, ICANN
announced that it had selected VeriSign as the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain, and ICANN and VeriSign have entered into a contract to confirm that selection. VeriSign anticipates that its selection as the .net
registry operator will resolve its request for arbitration.

In
October 2005, the Company and ICANN announced a proposed settlement of the various claims between them. The settlement was conditioned upon, among other things, approval of the agreement by the United States Department of Commerce. On
November 29, 2006, the United States Department of Commerce approved the new .com Registry Agreement. With that approval, the settlement is finalized and implemented. Accordingly, pending litigation with ICANN was dismissed.

On February 14, 2005, Southeast Texas Medical Associates, LLP filed a
putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, alleging violations of the unfair competition laws, breach of express warranty and unjust enrichment relating to our Secure Site Pro SSL certificates. The complaint is brought on
behalf of a class of persons who purchased the Secure Site Pro certificate from February 2001 to present. On April 17, 2006, the class was certified and class notice was issued on May 21, 2007. VeriSign disputes these claims. While we
cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

On March 8, 2005, plaintiff Charles Ford filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, alleging
fraud, negligent misrepresentation, false advertising, and violations of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act and unfair competition laws relating to marketing and advertising of mobile phone “ringtones” and other content by
VeriSign’s subsidiaries, Jamster International Sarl and Jamba! GmbH. The complaint is brought on behalf of classes of persons who responded to advertising by sending a text message on their mobile phones or registered over the Internet to
purchase ringtone or other content. On April 18, 2005, VeriSign removed the action to the federal district court for the Southern District of California. VeriSign disputes the claims in this action. While we cannot predict the outcome of this
matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

On April 11, 2005, Prism Technologies, LLC filed a complaint against VeriSign in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that VeriSign’s “Go Secure suite of application and related hardware and software
products and its Unified Authentication solution and related hardware and software products, including the VeriSign Identity Protection (“VIP”) product” infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,516,416, entitled “Subscription Access
System for Use With an Untrusted Network.” Prism Technologies seeks judgment in favor of Prism Technologies, a permanent injunction from infringement, damages in an amount not less than a reasonable royalty, attorneys’ fees and costs.
Prism Technologies has also named RSA Security, Inc., Netegrity, Inc. Computer Associates International, Inc and Johnson & Johnson as co -defendants. VeriSign responded on June 6, 2005 by filing a counterclaim for declaratory
relief and an answer denying any infringement and asserting that the patent is invalid. On November 9, 2006, the Court held a Markman claim construction hearing. On February 9, 2007, Plaintiff withdrew its claim against Go Secure,
leaving claims against Unified Authentication and VIP. On April 2, 2007, the Court issued a ruling from the Markman claim construction hearing. On April 13, 2007, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Leave to File Amended Answers
and Counterclaims to add an inequitable conduct defense. On April 23, 2007, on the basis of the Markman claim construction ruling, the Court entered a stipulated Final Judgment of Non-Infringement, dismissing all claims and counterclaims in the
case. On April 27, 2007, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to
vigorously defend against them.

On June 2, 2005, the
Company received an access letter from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for information to determine whether VeriSign, using the trade name Jamster, was engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5 of the Federal
Trade Commission Act in its advertising, offering and



billing for content services and products. The Company also received civil investigative demands from the Illinois State Attorney General (dated
June 30, 2005) and from the Florida State Attorney General (dated October 6, 2005). Each of these letters requested information related to the marketing of Jamster ringtone and other downloadable content services.

In August 2005 and October 2005, respectively, VeriSign received two
additional similar putative class action lawsuits, one in state court in Arkansas (short title, Page v. VeriSign), alleging claims for fraud, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and one in federal district
court for the Southern District of California (short title, Herrington v. VeriSign), alleging claims for fraud, negligence and negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, breach of contract, breach of warranty, false advertising,
and unfair competition. These lawsuits relate to the marketing and advertising of mobile phone “ringtones” and other mobile phone content by VeriSign and its subsidiary Jamster International Sarl. VeriSign disputes the claims in these
actions. On April 14, 2006 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings in the Ford, Page, and Herrington actions (short title, In Re Jamster Marketing Litigation). On June 16, 2006, the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conditionally transferred one additional similar putative class action lawsuit, alleging violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act and Illinois Automatic Contract Renewal Act (short title, Harmon v.
VeriSign), from the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois to the federal district court for the Southern District of California, where it will be coordinated with the Ford matter for pretrial proceedings. Similarly, on
September 14, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conditionally transferred another similar putative class action lawsuit, alleging violations of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (short title, Edwards v.
VeriSign), from the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida to the federal district court for the Southern District of California, where it will likely be coordinated with the Ford matter for pretrial proceedings. While we cannot
predict the outcome of these matters, VeriSign believes the allegations are without merit.

On February 24, 2006, GEMA, the German music authors collecting society, submitted an application to the Schiedsstelle, an arbitration board responsible for copyright matters at the German Patent and Copyright
Office, requesting arbitration of GEMA’s claim for alleged underpaid royalties in connection with Jamba GmbH’s sale of ringtones as downloadable content for mobile phones. Jamba is a wholly owned subsidiary of VeriSign,
Inc. Jamba pays royalties to GEMA on a “per download” basis for ringtones. GEMA claims that Jamba should also pay royalties for all GEMA-represented ringtones made available to Jamba customers, regardless of whether or
not the content represented by GEMA has been downloaded by a Jamba customer. On April 11, 2006, the Schiedsstelle notified Jamba! that it will conduct an arbitration of GEMA’s claim. Jamba submitted a response to
GEMA’s application on May 22, 2006. GEMA submitted an answer to Jamba’s response on August 6, 2006. Jamba submitted a reply to GEMA’s answer on or about October 23, 2006. Arbitration has not yet been
scheduled. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

On June 26, 2006, VeriSign received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents
relating to VeriSign’s stock option grants and practices. VeriSign also received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requesting documents related to VeriSign’s stock option grants and
practices. On February 9, 2007, VeriSign received a formal order of investigation from the SEC. VeriSign is cooperating fully with the U.S. Attorney’s investigation and the SEC investigation.

On July 6, 2006, a stockholder derivative complaint (Parnes v.
Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) was filed against the Company, as a nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former directors and executive officers related to certain historical stock option grants. The complaint seeks
unspecified damages on behalf of VeriSign, constructive trust and other equitable relief. Two other derivative actions were filed, one in federal court (Port Authority v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign), and one in state court (Port Authority v.
Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) on August 14, 2006. VeriSign is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. The federal actions have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on November 20, 2006. Motions to
dismiss



the consolidated federal court complaint were heard on May 23, 2007. Motions to stay the state court action are pending. On May 15, 2007, a
putative class action (Mykityshyn v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) was filed in state court naming the Company and certain current and former officers and directors, alleging false representations and disclosure failures regarding certain historical
stock option grants. The plaintiff purports to represent all individuals who owned VeriSign common stock between April 3, 2002 and August 9, 2006. The complaint seeks rescission of amendments to the 1998 and 2006 Option Plans and the
cancellation of shares added to the 1998 Option Plan. The complaint also seeks to enjoin defendants from granting any stock options and from allowing the exercise of any currently outstanding options granted under the 1998 and 2006 Option Plans. The
complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, costs and attorneys fees. The matter was removed to federal court on June 25, 2007. VeriSign and the individual defendants dispute all of these claims.

On November 7, 2006, a judgment was entered against VeriSign by an
Italian trial court in the matter of Penco v. VeriSign, Inc., for Euro 5.8 million plus fees arising from a lawsuit brought by a former consultant who claimed to be owed commissions. VeriSign was granted a stay on execution of
the judgment. VeriSign has appealed the lower court’s ruling on the merits and the hearing on the appeal is likely to be scheduled in May 2008. VeriSign believes the claims are without merit.

On November 30, 2006, Freedom Wireless, Inc. filed a complaint against
VeriSign and other defendants alleging that VeriSign infringes certain patents by making, using, selling or supplying products, methods or services relating to supplying prepaid wireless telephone services to telecommunications companies. VeriSign
filed an answer to the complaint on January 25, 2007. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. No scheduling conference has been set. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter,
VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

On January 31, 2007, VeriSign and News Corporation finalized a joint venture giving News Corporation a controlling interest in VeriSign’s wholly
owned Jamba subsidiary. Accordingly, effective January 31, 2007, VeriSign transferred to the joint venture direction and control of all litigation relating to Jamba! GmbH and Jamster International Sarl. Litigation and other legal matters
covered by that transfer include, but are not limited to, In Re Jamster Marketing Litigation (Ford, Page, Herrington, Harmon and Edwards), the Federal Trade Commission access letter, the Illinois Attorney General Civil Investigative Demand, the
Florida Attorney General Subpoena Duces Tecum, and the GEMA application for arbitration.

On May 31, 2007, plaintiffs Karen Herbert, et al., on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of consumers, filed a complaint against VeriSign, Inc., m-Qube, Inc., and other defendants
alleging that defendants collectively operate an illegal lottery under the laws of multiple states by allowing viewers of the NBC television show “Deal or No Deal” to incur premium text message charges in order to participate in
an interactive television promotion called “Lucky Case Game.” The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division. While we cannot predict the outcome of this
matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

On June 5, 2007, plaintiffs Cheryl Bentley, et al., on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of consumers, filed a complaint
against VeriSign, Inc., m-Qube, Inc., and other defendants alleging that defendants collectively operate an illegal lottery under the laws of multiple states by allowing viewers of the NBC television show “The Apprentice” to
incur premium text message charges in order to participate in an interactive television promotion called “Get Rich With Trump.” The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western
Division. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

On June 7, 2007, plaintiffs Michael and Michele Hardin, on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class
of consumers, filed a complaint against VeriSign, Inc. and other defendants alleging that defendants collectively operate various “gambling games” in violation of Georgia state law. Plaintiffs allege that
interactive television



promotions contained in various broadcasts, including NBC’s “Deal or No Deal,” wrongly permit participants to incur premium text message
charges in order to participate in the promotions to win a prize. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Gainesville Division. While we cannot predict the outcome
of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

VeriSign is involved in various other investigations, claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business, none of which, in our opinion
will harm its business. VeriSign cannot assure that it will prevail in any litigation. Regardless of the outcome, any litigation may require VeriSign to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management
attention.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Price Range of Common Stock

VeriSign’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
under the symbol “VRSN.” The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share for our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market:

On June 29, 2007,
there were 845 holders of record of our common stock; although we believe there are approximately 150,000 beneficial owners since many brokers and other institutions hold our stock on behalf of stockholders. On June 29, 2007, the reported last
sale price of our common stock was $31.73 per share as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and significantly affected by factors such as:

•

general market and economic conditions and market conditions affecting technology and Internet stocks generally;

•

announcements of technological innovations, acquisitions or investments by us or our competitors;

•

developments in Internet governance; and

•

industry conditions and trends.

The market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors.
Reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views. To the extent we have met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations in the past does not necessarily mean that we will be able to do so in the future. In the past,
securities class action lawsuits have often followed periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention
and resources.

We have never declared or paid any cash
dividends on our common stock or other securities and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, for future growth. Information regarding our equity compensation plans
may be found in Part III, Items 11 and 12, of this report. Further information regarding our equity compensation plans may be found in Note 11 “Stockholders’ Equity” in Item 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements
of this report.



Share Repurchases

To facilitate the stock repurchase program, designed to return value to the
stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties.

In 2001, the Board of Directors of VeriSign authorized the repurchase of up
to $350 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase program was completed in the third quarter of 2005. In 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase
up to $500 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase was completed in the second quarter of 2006. On May 16, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion
stock of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. The 2006 stock program has no determined end date. As of December 31, 2006, we have approximately $984.7 million available under the 2006 stock repurchase program.

The following table sets forth the total amount of shares
repurchased and net purchase price for the years presented:

From the inception of
the stock purchase program in 2001 to December 31, 2006, a total of 35.3 million shares have been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $865.3 million.



Performance Graph

The information contained in the Performance Graph shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or “filed” with the SEC or
subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the Exchange Act.

The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index, and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. The graph assumes that $100 was invested in our
common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index on December 31, 2001, and calculates the return quarterly through December 31, 2006. The stock price performance on the following graph is not

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
have been restated as set forth below. The data for the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 have been
restated, but such restated data has not been audited and is derived from the books and records of the Company. The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of results of future operations, and should be read in conjunction with
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K to fully
understand factors that may affect the comparability of the information presented below. The information presented in the following tables has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Company’s financial results, which is more fully
described in Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

We have not amended our previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods affected by this
restatement. The financial information that has been previously filed or otherwise reported for these periods is superseded by the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the financial statements and related financial information
contained in such previously filed reports should no longer be relied upon.

We have completed a number of acquisitions over the last three fiscal years, each of which was accounted for as a purchase transaction, which may affect year-over-year comparisons of our selected financial data. See a
description of such acquisitions fully described in Note 3, “Business Combinations” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the results of the acquired companies’ operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. We sold certain assets related to our payment gateway business in November 2005. We accounted for this business as discontinued operations and accordingly, we have reclassified the
selected financial data for all periods to reflect this business as discontinued operations. We completed the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business in November 2003.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Except for historical information, this Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our anticipated costs and expenses and revenue mix. Forward-looking
statements include, among others, those statements including the words “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “believes” and similar language. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in
the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors.” You should carefully review the risks described in other documents
we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K that we file in 2007. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.

In this Form 10-K, we are restating our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We are also restating the unaudited
quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and the unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006.

The decision to restate was based on the results of an independent review into our stock option accounting that was
conducted under the direction of an ad hoc group of our independent directors who had not served on our Compensation Committee before 2005 (“Ad Hoc Group”). As part of the restatement, we have also made adjustments to our consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 to correct errors identified for these fiscal years, which were not material to our financial statements in the aggregate or for any prior fiscal year.

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form
10-Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied upon.

We first learned of the potential issues associated with our past stock option grants from a May 16, 2006 article published by the Center for Financial Research and Analysis (“CFRA”) in which we were
referenced as one of 15 public companies with one or two stock grants between 1997 and 2002 that the CFRA suggested were timed at, or close to, 40-day lows in the applicable company’s stock price or preceding a material change in our stock
price. Promptly after learning of the CFRA article, and prior to receiving the grand jury subpoena or the informal SEC request described below, the Ad Hoc Group, with the assistance of independent outside counsel, Cleary Gottlieb Steen &
Hamilton LLP (“Cleary Gottlieb”), began reviewing the facts and circumstances of the timing of our historical stock option grants for the period January 1998 to May 2006 (“relevant period”). We believe that the analysis
was properly limited to the relevant period. In addition to Cleary Gottlieb, the Ad Hoc Group was assisted in its Review by independent forensic accountants (collectively the “Review Team”).

On June 27, 2006, we announced that we had received a grand jury
subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents relating to our stock option grants and practices dating back to January 1, 1995, and had received an informal request for information from the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) related to our stock option grants and practices. On February 9, 2007, we subsequently received a formal order of investigation from the SEC. We are fully cooperating with the U.S.
Attorney’s investigation and the SEC investigation.



On November 21, 2006, we announced that the Ad Hoc Group had determined the need to restate our
historical financial statements to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense related to past stock option grants.

On March 30, 2007, we requested guidance from the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC (the “OCA”) concerning certain accounting
issues relating to the restatement of our historical financials and the Review. On June 25, 2007, we concluded our discussions with the OCA regarding these accounting issues.

On May 29, 2007, we announced that Stratton Sclavos, our then-current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, had
resigned from his position with VeriSign. Following Mr. Sclavos’ resignation, the Board elected director William A. Roper, Jr. as our President and CEO and Edward Mueller as our Chairman of the Board of Directors.

On July 10, 2007, Dana L. Evan, our then-current Executive Vice President of
Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, resigned from her position with VeriSign.

On July 5, 2007 and July 12, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Albert E. Clement Chief Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance and
Chief Financial Officer, respectively of the Company.

The
Review Team tested grants made on 239 dates, incurred 21,800 person-hours, searched more than 11 million pages of physical and electronic documents and conducted 75 interviews of 33 current and former directors, officers, employees, and
advisors. We announced on January 31, 2007 that the Ad Hoc Group’s Review was substantially completed and that, based on a review of the totality of evidence and the applicable law, the Review did not find intentional wrongdoing by any
current member of the senior management team or the former CEO. The Ad Hoc Group’s Review concluded that we failed to implement appropriate processes and controls for granting, accounting for, and reporting stock option grants and that
corporate records in certain circumstances were incomplete or inaccurate.

The Review Team examined all grants to Section 16 officers and directors during the relevant period, as well as 7 annual performance grants to rank and file employees and 179 acquisition, new hire and promotion,
and other grants to rank and file employees on 239 dates from January 1998 through January 2006.

The Review Team identified 8,164 stock option grants made on 41 dates during the relevant period for which measurement dates were incorrectly determined.
The measurement dates required revision because the stated date either preceded or was subsequent to the proper measurement date and the stock price on the stated date was generally lower than the price on the proper measurement date. In several
instances, the Review Team also determined that the stock price assigned on the initial grant dates was subsequently modified, without being given the required accounting and disclosure treatment.

Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC,
as part of the restatement, the grants during the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was finalized. The evidence related to each category of grant was analyzed including, but not limited
to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, and consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, the controlling accounting standards
were applied to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock-based compensation
expense and related income tax effects.



Measurement Date Hierarchy

We have adopted the following framework for determining
the measurement dates of our stock option grants and have applied this framework to each grant based on the facts, circumstances and availability of documentation.

•

We reviewed the date of the minutes of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee meetings for grants made at such meetings when the number of options and
exercise price for each recipient had been clearly approved. Where the Review Team determined that the meeting date was not the measurement date, the Review Team determined the actual date of approval of the grant via other documentary evidence and
interviews.

•

When a grant was approved by unanimous written consent (“UWC”), the measurement date was the date of the Compensation Committee’s approval of the UWC
as established by available evidence, such as receipt of signature pages of the UWC, contemporaneous telephone and/or e-mail communications.

•

If a grant was approved by the CEO under authority delegated by the Compensation Committee, the measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval
to the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price.

•

If a grant was approved by the CEO based on the mistaken belief that he had delegated authority to do so (de facto or “substantive” authority), the
measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price.

•

In the event the date on which the CEO communicated approval was not evident from the approval forms, the measurement date was the date on which other available
evidence, such as the surrounding e-mail communications, established the date the CEO approved the grant.

•

In the event the date of CEO approval could not be established by reviewing other available evidence, such as e-mails, the measurement date was the date on which
the number of options and exercise price were entered into our option tracking database (Equity Edge).

•

Except for grants to Section 16 officers which require Compensation Committee approval, for new hire grants and promotion grants, prior to March 13, 1998,
the measurement date was the date the Compensation Committee approved the grant (as described above). For new hire grants and promotion grants after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and after September 30, 2002, the measurement
date was the 15th day or the last day of the month (or the prior business day if that day was not a business day) following the actual and documented start date or promotion date of the respective employee receiving the grant. New hire grants and
promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval. For new hire grants and promotion grants in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002, the measurement date was
the date on which the CEO communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price. If that date could not be
determined, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge.

After determining the measurement date through the steps in the above Measurement Date Hierarchy, we then determined if there were any changes to the
individual recipients, exercise prices or amount of shares granted after such measurement date. If there were no changes following such measurement date, then that date would be used. If we identified changes following such measurement date, then we
would evaluate whether the changes should delay the measurement date for the entire list of grants on that date, result in a repricing, or result in separate accounting for specific grants.



Director Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    Grants to directors under the 1998 Director Plan (the
“Director Plan”) were automatic and non-discretionary; the Director Plan did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee to review or approve director grants. Each new director received an initial grant of a specified
number of options on the date of his or her appointment and annually on the anniversary of the initial grant to be priced on the appointment or anniversary date, respectively. Directors serving before the Director Plan was adopted received an annual
grant on the anniversary of their previous grant.

Method
for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    For the initial grant, the measurement date was the date the director was appointed to the Board, as reflected in Board minutes. In the absence of Board minutes, the date specified
in the proxy statement or, if not clear, the date of the first Board meeting attended by the new director. For anniversary grants, annually on the date of the initial grant (or the next business day if such date was not a business day).

Executive Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation
Committee is required to approve all grants to executive officers. For grants to the former CEO, the Review Team concluded that, in all but three cases (including the February 2002 grant described below), the Compensation Committee or the Board of
Directors approved the grant on the stated grant date, resulting in a correct measurement date.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    For grants other than the February/May 2002 grant described below,
including the other two grants to the former CEO referred to above, please refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Acquisition Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    CEO authorization required. The Board of Directors implicitly delegated to the CEO authority to
approve grants to employees from acquisitions when the Board approved an acquisition.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Annual Refresh Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation Committee was required to approve all annual refresh grants through and
including the 2004 annual refresh grant. In 2005, the Compensation Committee delegated to the CEO the authority to approve rank and file annual refresh grants.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Extended Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation
Committee or the Board of Directors is required to approve all extensions of grants.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Extended grants are a modification of a previous award. Available documentation was used to establish the modification date and to measure
the additional compensation charge.

Retention and
Off-Cycle Grants

Required Granting
Actions

:    The Compensation Committee is required to approve all retention and off-cycle grants.



Method for Determining
Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Documentation Hierarchy above. For the February/May 2002 retention grant described below, the former CEO approved the grants to rank and file employees.

New Hire and Promotion Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    New hire grants and
promotion grants made after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and those made after September 30, 2002 were automatic and did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee review or approval. Prior to March 13,
1998, the Compensation Committee was required to approve all new hire and promotion grants. New hire grants and promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement
Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

The 8,164 grants previously identified as having incorrectly determined measurement dates were classified into the following six categories: (1) 27 grants on 11 dates to persons elected or appointed as
members of the Board of Directors (“Director Grants”); (2) 33 grants to executive officers (“Executive Grants”); (3) 2,908 grants to employees issued after an acquisition, newly hired employees and promoted employees
under the new hire and promotion grants program described below (“New Hire and Promotion Grants Program”), and other grants to a large number of non-executives; (4) 4,226 grants made in broad-based awards to large numbers of
employees, usually on an annual basis (“Annual Refresh Grants”); (5) 964 off-cycle performance grants; and (6) 6 grants whereby the expiration dates were extended (“Extended Grants”). All references to the number of
option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices have been adjusted for all subsequent stock splits.

As discussed below, it was determined that the originally assigned grant dates for 8,164 grants were not ascribed the proper measurement dates for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures, stock-based compensation expense of $171.4 million on a pre-tax basis was recognized over the respective awards’ vesting terms for the periods from 1998 to 2006. As noted
below, we also considered alternative measurement dates for eight grant dates which, if applied, would have resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of approximately $25.7 million. The adjustments made to reflect the proper
measurement dates for accounting purposes and the financial statement impact of the alternative measurement dates considered by us, were determined by category as follows:

Director Grants

:    64 director grants were made on 36 dates during the relevant period. Of the
64 grants, there were 27 grants to directors for which it was determined that the originally determined grant dates preceded or succeeded the measurement dates, 11 grants were in excess of plan parameters, and some of the dates were selected in
hindsight based on an advantageous share price. Of the 27 grants with measurement date issues, 26 of the grants involved periods of 5 days or less and resulted in a stock-based compensation expense of less than $100,000 in the aggregate. Revisions
to measurement dates for director grants were made where the wrong date was selected based on the requirements of the Director Plan and where incorrect start dates were used for the date the director joined the Board of Directors. The excess grants
have been historically honored by us. As a result, $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

Executive Officer Grants

:    It was determined that for 33 of the grants to executive officers, the originally determined grant
dates preceded the measurement dates or the grant dates and exercise prices were subsequently changed. Some of these dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. As the stock prices on the originally determined grant dates
were lower than the stock prices on the proper measurement date, $28.1 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized. The revised measurement dates for various executive officer grants were based on Compensation Committee meeting dates,
signed UWCs, delayed CEO approval, and for one date the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. We also considered an alternative measurement date for one grant date
which would have increased the compensation expense by approximately $130,000 for that grant. The authority for 21 grants, which have been historically honored by us, is based on the CEO’s presumed authority.



New Hire and Promotion Grants Program

:    We concluded that the new hire and
promotion grants made pursuant to the New Hire and Promotion Grants Program within the pre-established guidelines did not require an adjustment, with the exception of the grants made from September 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002. For the
1,728 grants made during that time period, management concluded that the measurement dates occurred only on the dates of the CEO approval. Due to practical difficulties in ascertaining the actual dates of the CEO approval for many new hire and
promotion grants in that time period, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. The incremental stock-based compensation expense associated with the New Hire and
Promotion Grants during the relevant period was $11.9 million.

Acquisition Grants

:    After the consummation of certain acquisitions, we granted stock options to employees of the acquired entities. It was determined that the measurement dates for 1,180 option grants required
revision because the stated grant dates preceded the proper measurement dates and the approval authority was based on CEO approval. Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. Of the 1,180 grants, 1,048 grants
were extinguished as part of our exchange program which commenced in November 2002. Due to issues associated with the measurement dates for the acquisition grants, $36.2 million of additional stock-based compensation expense was recognized
during the relevant period. We also considered an alternative measurement date for three different acquisition grant dates which, if they had been used, would have increased the compensation expense by approximately $675,000.

Annual Refresh Grants

:    During the relevant
period, 3,782 broad-based grants were made to employees under an annual program (the “Refresh Grants”) for which the originally assigned grant dates were not the proper measurement dates. Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based
on an advantageous share price, and the authority for some of the Refresh Grants was the CEO’s presumed authority. For one of the annual Refresh Grants which occurred in August 2000, there was conflicting documentation and inconclusive
evidence with respect to the measurement date. It was determined that the most appropriate measurement date, due to the lack of affirmative evidence otherwise, was the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity
Edge, and based on that date, $19.2 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the period 2000 to 2002. These grants were extinguished in December 2002 as part of our exchange program which commenced in November 2002. We did
not approve or process any stock option grants to existing employees during the period of the tender offer or agree or imply that we would compensate employees for any increases in the market price during the tender period. The Review also
determined that the annual refresh grants for the years 1999, 2001, 2004, and a portion of the 2003 grant had a measurement date that was later than the date that was originally used. In these cases, where the measurement dates were revised, the
authority for the grants varied and included new dates based on UWCs by the Compensation Committee or approvals by the CEO. Where approval was not determinable based on the above, we utilized the date on which the number of options and exercise
price were entered into Equity Edge. Due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the annual refresh grants, stock-based compensation expense of $55.1 million was recognized. We also considered alternative measurement dates for two refresh
grants which did not create additional compensation charge where one alternative measurement date had a lower price than the original grant date and the options for the second alternative measurement date were cancelled prior to the one-year cliff
vesting date.

Off-Cycle Performance
Grants

:    There were 964 performance grants made to employees on March 15, 2001 and October 1, 2003. These dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, and the authority for these grants was
the CEO’s de facto authority. The revised measurement dates were based on the dates of the UWC for the March 15, 2001 grant and e-mail correspondence for the October 1, 2003 grant. Due to the errors in measurement dates associated
with the off-cycle performance grants, stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million was recognized. We also considered an alternative measurement date for the October 1, 2003 grant which, if it had been used, would have decreased the
compensation expense by approximately $100,000 for that grant.

Extended Grants

:    During the relevant period, there were 6 stock option extensions (including one to the former CEO described below) whereby an option was extended beyond its expiration or termination date and
for



which a compensation charge had not been recorded. As a result, $2.1 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

The former CEO received certain options from Network Solutions, Inc.
(“NSI”) in his capacity as a NSI director prior to our acquisition of NSI. Upon receiving legal advice, management extended the term of those options beyond their original expiration date. The former CEO exercised those options on
May 24, 2002. The Ad Hoc Group reviewed the extension of these options and determined that the legal advice was incorrect and that the options should not have been extended. Upon learning of this determination in January 2007, the former CEO
voluntarily paid us $174,425, reflecting the after-tax net profit he received from the exercise of those options.

2002 Retention Grants

:    Between February and May 2002, the Compensation Committee considered special option grants as a
retention incentive for executive officers and other executives and key employees, since in many cases the exercise prices of options previously granted to these individuals were significantly above the then-current market price for shares of our
common stock. These retention grants are summarized as follows:

Grants to Executive Officers and Other Executives

:    We determined that 68 grants of options for a total of 4,631,000 shares to executive officers and other executives were finalized on April 10, 2002 rather
than the stated grant date of February 21, 2002. The Review Team was unable, after review of detailed documentation, including multiple draft versions of the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee minutes, approval forms (which were
undated) and email correspondence, to affirmatively determine when the grants to executive officers and other executives were approved. In accordance with our measurement date hierarchy for grants described above, we determined that April 10,
2002 was the correct measurement date because that was the date that other grants, including certain executive grants, were entered into Equity Edge. The grant price as of the measurement date was $23.74, the closing market price of our stock on
April 10, 2002. Because the stated exercise price of the grants was set based on the closing market price on February 21, 2002 of $22.71 and preceded the measurement date, an incremental $1.3 million of stock-based compensation expense was
recognized.

We also determined that the Compensation Committee
repriced 1,870,000 of these options on May 24, 2002, with an exercise price of $10.08, the closing market price of our stock on May 24, 2002. We determined that these grants were a reprice based on a UWC of the Compensation Committee. The
accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. In accordance with FIN 44 and after applying variable accounting, we
recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately $15.8 million, net of reversals, for the periods between 2002 and 2006. Had we considered an alternative measurement date between the periods from February 13, 2002
through April 25, 2002, compensation expense would have increased by up to $25.0 million for these grants.

Grants to Employees

:    Broad-based employee grants were also considered during the February to May 2002 period. The
Review Team determined that the CEO, under his presumed authority, approved 305 broad-based employee grants on or about March 20, 2002 with a grant price of $26.42, the closing market price of our stock on that date. These awards were
communicated shortly thereafter to the employees. We determined that March 20, 2002 was a definitive measurement date for the awards to the employees.

The grants to employees previously approved by the CEO on March 20, 2002 were submitted for approval to the Compensation Committee as evidenced in a
UWC dated May 24, 2002. The Compensation Committee approved the 305 employee grants with an exercise price of $10.08, the market value of our common stock on May 24, 2002. Therefore the employee awards were re-priced on that date. Although
the awards had been communicated to the employees and disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2002, the accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly
disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing, and after applying variable accounting, approximately $6.6 million, net of reversals of additional stock-based compensation expense, has been recorded for the periods between
2002 and 2006.



Retention Grants to our former CEO

:    In the February 12, 2002
Compensation Committee meeting, the Committee considered the number and vesting period of a proposed option award to the CEO. The Review Team found multiple draft versions of the minutes for the February 12, 2002 meeting of the Compensation
Committee and concluded that the signed minutes were inaccurate. Attendees at the meeting have different recollections of the business conducted. One draft, unapproved version of those minutes, stated the number of options to be awarded to the CEO
was 1,200,000, while the signed version of the minutes approved by the members of the Compensation Committee in late May 2002 stated that the number of options to be awarded was 600,000. Both versions of the minutes stated that the grant date
and the exercise price was February 21, 2002 and $22.71. The minutes of a Board meeting held on February 12, 2002, after the Compensation Committee meeting, also indicate that the CEO was awarded 1,200,000 options at the February 12,
2002 Compensation Committee meeting.

We have determined that
the measurement date for the 1,200,000 options to the CEO was February 12, 2002 with a grant price of $26.31, the closing market price of our stock on that date, and that the options were repriced on February 21, 2002 with a grant price of
$22.71, the closing market price of our stock on that date. Subsequently, 600,000 options of the 1,200,000 options were repriced on May 24, 2002 with a grant price of $10.08, the closing market price of our stock on that date. The accounting
impact of the repricings was not recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing, and after applying variable accounting, approximately $7.5
million, net of reversals, of additional stock-based compensation expense has been recorded for the periods between 2002 and 2006.

Actions Taken by the Board with respect to Grants

:    As part of the Review, the Board of Directors confirmed all option grants
(including those to our former CEO and CFO) that the Review Team concluded had authority issues as legally binding and enforceable obligations of the Company as of the date of such grant. In addition, the Board of Directors decided to modify the
following grants to the former CEO and CFO in 2007 and no reversal of compensation expense was recorded for these negative modifications in the financial statements.

Former CEO

:    An option grant to the former CEO of 100,000 shares originally dated
December 29, 2000 at an exercise price of $74.188 was modified to a new exercise price of $127.31.

Former CEO

:    The February 2002 option grant to the former CEO of 600,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an
exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $26.31.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to the CFO of 25,000 shares originally dated December 29, 2000 at an exercise price of $74.188 was modified to a new exercise price of $127.31.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to
the CFO of 125,000 shares originally dated August 1, 2000 at an exercise price of $151.25 was modified to a new exercise price of $165.22.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to the CFO of 40,000 shares originally dated March 15, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.44
was modified to a new exercise price of $42.26. The CFO’s 409A tax election described below modified 1,667 of these options and the Board of Directors determined to modify the remaining 38,333 options.

Former CFO

:    A grant to the CFO of 90,000 shares
originally dated September 6, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.16 was modified to a new exercise price of $38.30. The CFO’s 409A tax election described below modified 11,250 of these options and the Board of Directors determined to modify
the remaining 78,750 options.

Former
CFO

:    The February 2002 option grant to the CFO of 100,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $23.74.

Other

:    The Company and the Review Team also
determined that the former CEO received an option grant in October 1998 for 100,000 shares (95,928 non-qualified stock options (“NQSOs”) and 4,072 incentive stock



options (“ISOs”)), which split to options for 200,000 shares in May 1999 and then split again to options for 400,000 shares in
November 1999 when we announced a stock split during those respective periods. The account statements and monthly reporting statements for November 1 and December 1, 2000 showed that the former CEO held options for 400,000 shares at
the split-adjusted price of $7.67. However, the Ad Hoc Group determined that sometime between December 1, 2000 and January 1, 2001, we erroneously changed the former CEO’s options to reflect the pre-split amount of 100,000 shares
instead of 400,000 shares, but at the post-split price of $7.67. The error was never subsequently corrected. Therefore, the former CEO did not receive the benefit of the additional 300,000 options arising from the two stock splits, which expired in
2005. Based on a determination by the Board of Directors after the Ad Hoc Group’s Review in May 2007, we have agreed to pay the former CEO $5,459,430, reflecting the gain he would have realized from the exercise of these options prior to their
expiration, based on the weighted-average price of stock options exercised by the former CEO in August 2005.

The other principal factual findings of the Review included the following:

•

The human resources, accounting, and legal departments failed to implement appropriate processes and controls. During 2000 through 2003, the option grant process
was characterized by a high degree of informality and relatively little oversight.

•

The Review found no evidence that accounting personnel were aware of the deficient practices used in selecting grant dates.

•

The Review found instances of incomplete and inaccurate corporate records, including two sets of Committee minutes that were inaccurate.

•

The Review found no evidence of fictitious individuals being granted options.

•

Options found to be misdated, have a date chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, repriced, or unauthorized with a stated exercise price lower
than the share price at the actual approval date will result in adverse tax consequences to the recipients and us.

•

In light of the Review’s other findings, our disclosures related to option grants were inaccurate in some respects.

The principal recommendations of the Ad Hoc Group’s Review included the
following:

•

The Board or the Compensation Committee should approve all grants that the Review found to be unauthorized, with the exception of certain grants made to our former
CEO and CFO. The Board or the Compensation Committee should consider whether to cancel or request forfeiture of any options granted to the former CEO and CFO that were determined to be unauthorized, misdated, have a date chosen in hindsight based on
an advantageous share price, or repriced, and then should consider the appropriate equity compensation for these officers for the periods covered by the Review.

•

We should develop and implement detailed written grant policies.

•

We should designate individuals in the legal and accounting departments to oversee the documentation of and accounting for option grants.

•

We should develop and implement improved training and controls relating to option granting practices to ensure that all personnel involved in the granting and
administration of stock options understand the relevant option plans and accounting, tax, and disclosure requirements.

•

We should award regular grants (new hire, promotion, and annual performance) at predetermined dates and with all approvals documented and finalized on those dates.

The Board has adopted all of the
Review’s findings and recommendations. Under the direction of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, and with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, we have implemented or are in the process of implementing the
recommendations.



Based on the results of the Review, we have recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense
(benefit) net of related income tax effects related to past stock option grants of $1.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, ($21.6) million and $36.9 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. These adjustments
were recorded based on the evidence and findings from the Ad Hoc Group’s review, including analysis of the measurement dates for the 8,164 stock option grants made on 41 dates during the relevant period that the Review determined were
incorrect.

The incremental impact from recognizing stock-based
compensation expense resulting from the Ad Hoc Group’s Review of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Pre-tax expense adjustments are through March 31, 2006 and represents amounts being reported pursuant to FAS 123R whereas amounts for all other years represent amounts being
reported pursuant to APB 25.

(2)

Includes $0.8 million of other stock-based compensation adjustments that were unrelated to past stock option grants.

Additionally, the pro forma expense under SFAS No. 123 in Note 1 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K has been restated to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

As noted above we considered alternative measurement dates for eight grants
which, if applied, would have resulted in additional stock-based compensation of approximately $25.7 million. With the exception of these eight grants, there was no uncertainty on the measurement date for option grants. The table below shows what
the incremental impact to stock-based compensation expense would have been by category of grant had these alternative measurement dates been applied (in thousands):



Tax Implications

We evaluated the impact of the restatements on our global tax provision and
have determined that a portion of the tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation expense formerly associated with stock option deductions is attributable to continuing operations. We identified deferred tax assets totaling $16.3 million at
December 31, 2005 which reflect the benefit of tax deductions from future employee stock option exercises. We have not realized this or any other deferred tax asset relating to taxing jurisdictions within the United States as of
December 31, 2005.

We also believe that we should not
have taken a tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m) in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives. Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above certain
thresholds. As a result, our tax net operating losses associated with the stock option intra-period allocation have decreased by $12.6 million. We continue to apply a valuation allowance to our tax net operating losses relating to stock options
exercised prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123R, “

Share-Based Payment

.” Pursuant to Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R, we recognize financial statement benefit of these tax net operating losses when such losses reduce cash taxes
paid.

Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
(“Section 409A”) imposes significant penalties on individual income taxpayers who were granted stock options that were unvested as of December 31, 2004 and that have an exercise price of less than the fair market value of the stock on
the date of grant (“Affected Options”). These tax consequences include income tax at vesting, an additional 20% tax and interest charges. In addition, the issuer of Affected Options must comply with certain reporting and withholding
obligations under Section 409A.

These adverse tax
consequences may be avoided for unexercised Affected Options if the exercise price of the Affected Option is adjusted to reflect the fair market value at the time the option was granted (as such measurement date is determined for financial reporting
purposes). Under Treasury regulations, Affected Options held by executive officers or directors were to be amended on or before December 31, 2006 to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A; holders of Affected Options who are
not our executive officers or directors have until December 31, 2007 to amend their Affected Options to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A. Four of our current and former executive officers and a current director holding
Affected Options elected to increase the exercise price of their Affected Options to the market price on December 31, 2006. Effective December 31, 2006, the exercise prices of Affected Options held by D. James Bidzos, a current board
member, Dana Evan, former Chief Financial Officer, Robert Korzeniewski, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, Judy Lin, former Executive Vice President of Security Services and Mark McLaughlin, Executive Vice President of Products,
Marketing and Customer Support, were adjusted so that these options will not be subject to Section 409A. We are currently considering actions to avoid or alleviate certain of the adverse tax consequences associated with Affected Options for
employees who are not executive officers of the Company and whether to offer compensation to the executive officers and director who elected to increase the exercise price of their Affected Options as of December 31, 2006. Should we decide to
take actions to avoid or alleviate these adverse tax consequences associated with current and former employees outstanding Affected Options, we estimate the related compensatory payments would be approximately $11.6 million. In June 2007, we made
payments of approximately $0.9 million on behalf of current and former employees who exercised Affected Options in 2006 under the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board 409A Compliance Resolution Programs. We estimate the cost to
participate in these Compliance Resolution Programs, including a gross-up payment to the affected employees, will be approximately $1.9 million.

Other Matters

As part of the restatement, we made other adjustments to previously stated financial statements back to 2002. These adjustments include corrections to
revenue, expenses, other income and related income tax adjustments. The adjustments mentioned below are in addition to the recognition of additional stock compensation expense resulting from the stock option investigation.



In 2002, we recorded a $2.7 million charge to stock compensation expense that was previously recorded in
the first quarter of 2003.

As part of our stock option
investigation, we were required to record additional payroll tax expense for the periods affected by the restatement. Although the statute for such taxes is closed through 2003, we recorded the additional payroll tax as if the statute were open, and
then reversed the accrual for payroll tax when the statute closed. We recorded additional immaterial expenses in 2002 and 2003 and reduced payroll tax expense by $4.0 million and $0.8 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

As part of the 2003 restructuring activities, we had one significant leased
property for which real estate taxes and utilities costs were not properly accounted for at the time of the restructuring. The adjustment resulted in an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $3.8 million in 2003. Approximately $1.5 million of
this adjustment was later released in 2004 as part of the building was subleased to a third party and $2.3 million was released in 2005 when the remainder of the space was assumed by another tenant directly with the landlord.

During 2004, we adjusted the interest amortization on the note receivable
from Network Solutions. This item was the result of adjusting the interest rate on the loan to a market rate. It was determined that this adjustment would have increased other income in the fourth quarter of 2003 by $1.9 million. We originally
booked the additional $1.9 million gain in 2004, which has since been reversed.

As a part of our internal control processes during 2006, we detected an error related to the accounting for software maintenance amortization for various software license arrangements acquired from vendors. As a
result of this error, we increased software maintenance expenses by $203,000 in 2004, $2.5 million in 2005 and $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2006.

During 2006, we detected two errors related to the accounting at our Jamba subsidiary in Berlin, Germany. The first error relates to the accounting for
insurance revenues recorded after Jamba was acquired. We did not properly account for insurance renewal premiums on contracts that were renewed after the acquisition. The second error relates to the timing of certain revenues, which were booked in
incorrect periods. The combined impact of these errors increased revenues $2.3 million in 2004, $3.1 million in 2005 and $284,000 in the first quarter of 2006.

In the first quarter of 2006, we reversed $1.1 million of revenue to account for billed services that were not delivered under contractual terms.

The following table presents the impact of the other
adjustments that are not related to the stock option investigation on consolidated selected financial data for the periods presented:



Business Overview

Dispositions

Payment Gateway Business Sale

On November 18, 2005, we completed the sale of certain assets related
to our payment gateway business to PayPal, Inc. and PayPal International Limited for $370 million in cash. This transaction was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (“SFAS 144”),

“Accounting for the Impairment or

Disposal of

Long Lived Assets”

(SFAS 144) and, accordingly, we have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all periods to reflect this transaction.

Domain Name Registrar Business

On January 9, 2006, Network Solutions repaid in full all amounts
outstanding under the Secured Senior Promissory Note dated November 25, 2003. In addition, Network Solutions redeemed our 15% equity interest in Network Solutions. We received approximately $47.8 million in total cash, which included the $26.5
million repayment of the note receivable and related interest and recognized a gain on investment of $21.3 million. As a result of the redemption of the membership interests, we no longer own equity interests in any Internet domain name

Tokyo-based, majority-owned consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. (“VeriSign Japan”), representing approximately 7% of our ownership interest, for approximately $78 million. After giving effect to the sale, we continue to own a
majority stake in VeriSign Japan equal to approximately 54% of VeriSign Japan’s total shares outstanding.

Subsequent Events

In January 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan to execute a company-wide reorganization replacing the previous business unit structure with a new
combined worldwide sales and services team, and an integrated development and products organization. The restructuring plan included workforce reductions, abandonment of excess facilities, disposals of property and equipment, and other charges. In
the first quarter of 2007, we recorded approximately $26.9 million in restructuring charges.

As of the date of the filing of this report, we are not in compliance with certain covenants under our Credit Agreement related to the $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the
“Facility”), as described in Note 10 “Credit Facility” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that require us to deliver specified financial statements, compliance certificates and certain other documents to our
Lenders. The required Lenders under the Facility have waived our compliance with these requirements through July 13, 2007. On February 28, 2007, we repaid $199 million in loans representing the entire outstanding balance under our $500
million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

On

global basis. Under the terms of the agreements Fox (through a subsidiary) will own a 51% interest in the joint ventures, and we (through a subsidiary) will own a 49% interest in the joint ventures. One of the joint ventures, Netherlands Mobile
Holdings, C.V., is based in the Netherlands, and the other is based in the United States. We contributed our Jamba “business to consumer” business to the Netherlands joint venture and Fox contributed its Fox Mobile Entertainment assets to
the U.S.-based joint venture. Fox paid us approximately $192.4 million in cash for its contribution of the Jamba business and we paid Fox approximately $4.9 million in cash for its contribution of Fox Mobile Entertainment assets



In the first quarter of 2007, we decided to sell our wholly-owned Jamba Services GmbH subsidiary. In
accordance with SFAS 144, the associated assets and liabilities of Jamba Services GmbH will be classified as held for sale and its operations will be reported as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2007.

On May 27, 2007, Stratton D. Sclavos, our former President, Chief
Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors and member of our Board of Directors, resigned from his positions. Effective May 27, 2007, our Board of Directors appointed William A. Roper, Jr., to replace Mr. Sclavos
as President and Chief Executive Officer, and elected Edward A. Mueller as Chairman of the Board of Directors.

On July 5, 2007 and July 12, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Albert E. Clement as Chief Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance
and Chief Financial Officer, respectively of the Company.

On
July 10, 2007, Dana Evan, our then-current Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer resigned from her position with VeriSign.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, restructuring and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles. Revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require
us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make
judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided. Our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events.

Revenues from consulting services are recognized either on a time-and-materials basis as the services are performed, or for
fixed price consulting as services are performed, completed and accepted. In some cases fixed price consulting is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting. Proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to
total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then
the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Revenues from time-and-materials are recognized as services are performed.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance



after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customer’s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer. We
review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above. In addition, we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on
the age category. We require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for
additional allowances in the future. As of December 31, 2006, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 2.4% of total accounts receivable, or approximately $8.1 million. A change of 1% in our estimate would amount to
approximately $3.4 million.

Valuation of
long-lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles

Our long-lived assets consist primarily of goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment. We review, at least annually, goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with SFAS 144.
Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business, difficulty and delays in
integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset.

Recoverability of long-lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
totaled approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006, which was comprised of $1.5 billion of goodwill and $0.3 billion of other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, technology in place, carrier
relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names, and other. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating
results, significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired, an
assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made. If this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other
comparable market valuations, of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted.
Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. It is our policy to engage third- party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our
long-lived intangible assets including goodwill.

Restructuring, impairment and other charges (reversals), net

In November 2003, we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. In April 2002, we initiated plans to restructure our operations to
fully



rationalize, integrate and align our resources. Both plans resulted in reductions in workforce, abandonment of excess facilities, disposal of property and
equipment and other charges. We expect these restructuring plans to be completed in 2008 upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities. Restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the
abandoned space, including the potential for sublease income. Estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented, the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of
each property. These estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located, such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates. Changing market conditions by
location and considerable work with third-party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis, as necessary. During 2006, we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately $6.4
million primarily related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations. Such estimates will likely be revised in the future.

Stock-based compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of, and accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s (“FASB”) SFAS 123R. We elected the modified prospective application method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new grants and to grants that
were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified. For stock-based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, we will amortize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period,
which is the vesting period. Estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures.

We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected
dividends.

We estimate the expected term of options granted
based on observed and expected time to post-vesting exercise and/or cancellations. Expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and
the mean historical implied volatility from traded options. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock-based awards are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.

If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different
valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share.

See Note 13 “Stock-Based Compensation” of our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding the SFAS 123R disclosures.



Results of Operations

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we had two reportable segments: the Internet
Services Group and the Communications Services Group. A comparison of revenues from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Internet Services Group (ISG)

2006 compared to 2005:

Revenues from
our ISG increased by approximately $125.0 million. Our Information Services Group revenue increased $83.7 million due to a 30% increase in the number of active domain names ending in

.com

and

.net

under management. Our Security
Services Group revenue increased $41.2 million primarily due to a $26.0 million increase in Website digital certificate revenue that was the result of a 65% increase in the installed base of digital certificates, a $17.7 million increase in our
managed security services and security consulting revenues partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in enterprise security services revenue. The 65% increase in the install base of Website digital certificates was primarily due to the 259,000
additional certificates acquired as a result of the acquisition of GeoTrust in September of 2006.

2005 compared to 2004:

Revenues from our ISG increased by approximately by $117.8 million. Our Information Services
revenue increased $62.3 million due a 30% increase in active domains ending in

.com

and

.net

under management. Our Security Services group increased $55.7 million, primarily due to a $29.2 million increase in Website digital
certificate revenues, and a $32.8 million increase in managed security services and security consulting revenue, partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease in enterprise security services.

The following table compares active domain names ending in

Communications Services Group (CSG)

2006 compared to 2005:

Revenues from our CSG decreased approximately $162.3 million, partially offset by a $57.8
million increase in revenue as a result of new acquisitions in 2006. Our Content Services revenue, which includes our digital content, messaging and mobile delivery services, decreased $159.4 million primarily due to a $231.7 million decrease from
Jamba, partially offset by $26.0 million increase in messaging services and $46.2 million of revenue as a result of 2006 acquisitions. The decline in our content services business was primarily attributable to increased pricing pressure and a
decline in the number of subscribers. Our Communication and Commerce Services revenue, which includes network connectivity services, intelligent databases and directory services, billing and payment services and clearing and settlement services
decreased by $7.8 million compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a $13.4 million decrease in clearing and settlement services and a $6.7 million decrease in connectivity and database services. These declines were primarily due to
industry consolidation and pricing pressures. These declines were partially offset by $6.4 million increase in billing and payment services, which was primarily due to the result of an increase in the number of subscribers.

2005 compared to 2004:

Revenues from our
CSG increased approximately $374.2 million primarily due to a $373.3 million increase in content services revenues during the year. This increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of Jamba revenue in 2005 as compared to seven months of
revenue in 2004 coupled with significant growth in our content services business during 2005. The content services business grew in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the same periods in 2004; however, revenues decreased
sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 due to increased pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers. Network services and connectivity revenues increased approximately $7.0 million and clearing, roaming, settlement
and intelligent network services revenues also increased by approximately



$10.9 million primarily due an increase in the number of records and transactions cleared. These increases were offset by a decline in billing and
payment services of approximately $24.7 million primarily due to a decline in the subscriber base and pricing reductions for these services during the year. Intelligent database services revenues were unchanged from 2004 as increases in queries were
off-set by price declines in our calling name (CNAM) service.

Revenues from the
Jamba business unit generated approximately $299 million in CSG revenue in 2006. We will record Jamba revenues through January 2007, and starting in February 2007, we will account for Jamba as an investment accounted for under the equity method. We
will record 49% of the Jamba joint venture net income as “other income” in the statement of income.

Revenues by Geographic Region

Our revenues are broken out into three geographic regions consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC. The following table shows a comparison of our
continuing revenues by geographic region for each year presented:

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Canada, Latin America and South America

(3)

Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)

(4)

Australia, Japan and Asia Pacific (“APAC”)

2006 compared to 2005:

Revenues increased approximately $107.1 million in the Americas region primarily as a result
of the increase in domain names ending in

.com

and

.net

under management coupled with an increase in the installed base of website digital certificates. Revenues in our EMEA region decreased approximately $163.4 million primarily due
to a decrease in revenue from Jamba business unit in the region. The increase in APAC revenues of approximately $19.0 million was attributed to increased enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia and increased managed security
services revenue in Japan.

2005 compared to
2004:

Revenues increased approximately $221.8 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the increase in domain names ending in

.com

and

.net

under management coupled with an increase in the
installed base of website digital certificates. Revenues in our EMEA region increased approximately $236.7 million primarily due to recognizing a full year of revenue from our Jamba business unit in



the region coupled with strong growth in Jamba in the first half of 2005. The increase in APAC revenues of approximately $33.5 million was attributed to
increased enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia and increased managed security services revenue in Japan.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues consists primarily of content licensing costs, carrier costs for our SS7 and IP-based networks, costs related to providing digital
certificate enrollment and issuance services, billing services, operational costs for the domain name registration business, customer support and training, consulting and development services, operational costs related to the management and
monitoring of our clients’ network security infrastructures, and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities.

A comparison of cost of revenues and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2006 compared to 2005:

Cost of revenues
increased approximately $68.2 million primarily due to the business acquisitions completed during 2006 and a full year of expenses for the business acquisitions completed in 2005. Salary and employee benefit costs increased approximately $38.2
million primarily due to a 30% increase in headcount primarily related to completed business acquisitions in 2006 and increases in salary and bonus payments to employees. Stock compensation expense increased $13.8 million primarily as a result of
the adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006. Contract and professional services increased approximately $13.9 million in 2006, primarily due to increased third-party customer care services and an increase in the use of contractors to support new product
initiatives and as a result of the acquisitions completed in 2006.

2005 compared to 2004:

Cost of revenues increased approximately $74.7 million primarily due to the business acquisitions completed in 2005 and an increase in costs in our content services business that
was primarily due to the Jamba acquisition in 2004. Salary and employee benefit costs increased approximately $33.8 million primarily due to a 24% increase in headcount, primarily due to completed business acquisitions in 2005 and increases in
commissions and bonuses. Expenses related to contract and professional services increased approximately $18.0 million in 2005, primarily due to increased costs for third-party customer care services, consulting for billing services and service
development costs for prepaid services. Retailer commissions related to content services increased approximately $7.4 million over 2004. Other increases in cost of revenues were related to cost of maintenance of equipment and software. These
increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in stock compensation expense that resulted from variable-plan accounting for certain stock option grants.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales, marketing, and policy activities. These expenses include salaries, sales
commissions, sales operations and other personnel-related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees and costs
of marketing programs, such as Internet, television, radio, print, and direct mail advertising costs.



A comparison of sales and
marketing expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2006 compared to 2005:

Sales and
marketing expenses decreased approximately $102.0 million primarily due to a decrease of approximately $144.9 million in advertising and marketing expense. The reason for the decline in advertising and marketing was primarily due to the result
of significant marketing cutbacks for our content services business. Salary and employee benefits increased approximately $13.6 million due to a 30% increase in headcount primarily related to the business acquisitions completed in 2006, and an
increase in bonus and commission payments. Stock compensation expense increased $15.0 million as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Travel expense increased approximately $5.5 million due to an increase in headcount and costs related to our
business acquisitions. Contract and professional services increased approximately $4.1 million as a result of policy efforts directly related to the renewal of the ICANN agreement.

2005 compared to 2004:

Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately
$232.9 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $201.0 million relating to advertising and marketing expenses. The increase in advertising and marketing was primarily due to the result of a significant increase in expenses that
resulted from the Jamba acquisition. Salary and employee benefits increased approximately $31.2 million primarily due to a 16% increase in headcount primarily due to business acquisitions in 2005 and recognizing a full year of expenses from 2004
acquisitions. Corporate brand advertising, including the re-launch of our brand, and corporate marketing, increased $4.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease in stock compensation expense that resulted from
variable-plan accounting for certain stock option grants.

Research and Development

Research and
development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment and support
services used in service and technology development.

We
believe that rapid development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our leadership position in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to
make other investments in research and development.

A
comparison of research and development expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



2006 compared to 2005:

Research and development expenses increased
approximately $33.7 million primarily due to additional expenses associated with the business acquisitions completed during 2006 and a full year of expenses for the completed business acquisitions in fiscal 2005. Salary and employee benefit
costs increased $17.6 million due to a 28% increase in headcount. Occupancy-related costs increased due to an increase in infrastructure and assets placed in service in 2006. Stock compensation expense increased $9.1 million as a result of the
adoption of SFAS 123R. Other increases were primarily related to costs associated with the depreciation and maintenance of equipment and software.

2005 compared to 2004:

Research and development expenses increased approximately $31.9 million primarily due to
additional expenses relating from the business acquisitions completed in 2005. Salary and employee benefit costs increased $25.5 million primarily due to a 96% increase in headcount. These increases were partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease
in stock compensation expense that resulted from variable-plan accounting for certain stock option grants. Occupancy-related costs increased due to additional infrastructure and assets placed in service in 2005 and additional expenses that resulted
from our business acquisitions.

General and
Administrative

General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, facilities, computer and communications equipment, management information
systems, support services, professional services fees, certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense.

A comparison of general and administrative expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2006 compared to 2005:

General and
administrative expenses increased approximately $76.7 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $20.3 million in salary and employee benefit costs resulting from a 39% increase in headcount and salary increases across all business units.
Stock compensation expense increased $38.6 million as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Expenses related to contract and professional services increased approximately $13.4 million primarily due to the legal and consulting services relating to
the stock option investigation.

2005 compared to
2004:

General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $13.8 million primarily due to a $45.6 million decrease in stock compensation expense that resulted from variable-plan accounting for certain stock
option grants. Salary and employee benefit costs increased approximately $17.0 million primarily due a 24% increase in headcount. Equipment and software related expenses increased approximately $7.4 million, primarily due to an increase in hardware
maintenance costs, software licenses and depreciation expense. Legal costs increased approximately $3.1 million primarily due to litigation settlements during the year. Expenses related to contract and professional services increased approximately
$3.1 million primarily due to services related to audit, tax and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.



Restructuring
Impairments and Other Charges, (Reversals), net

Below
is a comparison of the restructuring, impairment and other charges (reversals), net for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The changes in restructuring, impairment and other charges (reversals), net
are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives.

2002 and 2003 Restructuring Plan

.    In 2006, we recorded net reversal of restructuring charges of approximately $6.4 million primarily due to a $7.5 million reversal from an early termination of a lease for a
facility we had previously estimated would remain vacant for the remainder of the lease term. During 2005, we recorded a net reversal of restructuring charges of $2.9 million to our excess facilities primarily in connection with a decision to
utilize and build a facility that we had treated as abandoned under its 2003 restructuring plan and for which we had previously recorded a restructuring charge. As part of the restatement, we recorded a $2.3 million reversal to correct a charge that
was incorrectly expensed in 2005 and should have been expensed in 2003. In 2004, we recorded $3.3 million of restructuring charges primarily related to non-cancelable leases, workforce reduction charges and exit costs.

Impairment and other charges.

In 2006, we
recorded an impairment of approximately $2.0 million of other intangible assets specifically related to abandoned technology acquired for a specific customer. During 2005, we abandoned the development efforts related to an internally developed
software project and recorded an impairment of approximately $21.6 million. During 2004, we recorded approximately $20.1 million primarily relating to an impairment of obsolete telecommunications computer software and other equipment.

See Note 1 ‘Description of Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” and Note 6 “Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges (Reversals), net” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $21.1 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired in 2005 and new intangible assets acquired in 2006.
Other intangible amortization expense as a result of business acquired in 2006 was approximately $29.1 million.



2005 compared to 2004:

Amortization of other intangible assets
increased approximately $22.2 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of Jamba in June of 2004 and amortization expense related to our acquisition of LightSurf Technologies in
April of 2005. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from Jamba accounted for approximately $10.2 million of the increase. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from LightSurf accounted for approximately $8.8 million of the increase.

Our anticipated 2007 amortization expense is expected to be
approximately $124.3 million, including approximately $8.0 million related to Jamba. This amount may increase if we acquire any additional companies with intangible assets, or decrease if we dispose of any current companies with net intangible
assets.

See Note 8 “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Acquired In-process Research and Development

During 2006, we wrote-off approximately $16.7 million of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) acquired in the CallVision, Kontiki, m-Qube and GeoTrust transactions. During 2005, we wrote off
$7.7 million of IPR&D acquired in the purchase of LightSurf Technologies, iDefense, Moreover and Retail Solutions International. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated with the IPR&D efforts had not yet reached
technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies.

Minority interest

Minority interest represents the portion of net income belonging to minority
shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries.

2004:

Minority interest increased primarily from increased net income from our VeriSign Japan subsidiary primarily due to an increase in the install base of website security certificates and increased demand for
managed security services in Japan.

Other Income
(Expense), net

Other income, net consists primarily
of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments, and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses.



The following table presents
the components of other income, net for years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2006 compared to 2005:

Other income
decreased approximately $7.5 million primarily due to $7.8 million in interest expense related to our outstanding balance from our credit facility in 2006. We recorded a $21.7 million gain on sale of our remaining equity stake in Network Solutions.
Interest income decreased $2.5 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in our short-term investment balances.

2005 compared to 2004:

Other income decreased approximately $32.3 million primarily due to a gain on sale of VeriSign
Japan stock of approximately $74.9 million in 2004. In 2005, we realized gains on investments, net of losses and impairments, of approximately $11.3 million. Interest income increased $11.7 million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances and
slightly higher interest rates during 2005. In 2005 we recorded a gain of approximately $6.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute with a telecommunications carrier customer. As part of the restatement, we reduced our 2004 other income
by $1.9 million for a gain on investment that should have been recorded in 2003.

Income Tax Expense

In the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded income tax benefit from continuing operations of $241.3 million, or 176.5% of pretax income, income tax expense of $101.0 million, or 38.4% of pretax income, and income
tax expense of $21.2 million, or 13.5% of pretax income, respectively.

In previous fiscal years, we provided a tax valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets based on our evaluation that realizability of such assets was not “more likely than not.” We continuously evaluated
additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets. Such deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, temporary differences on
tax-deductible goodwill and intangibles, and temporary differences on deferred revenue. In the quarter ended June 30, 2006, based on additional evidence regarding our past earnings, scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected future
taxable income from operating activities, we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets would be realized. Accordingly, we released our valuation allowance of $236.4 million from our deferred tax assets resulting in a credit
to statement of income.

We continue to assess the future
realization of net deferred tax assets and believe that it is more likely than not that forecasted income, tax effects of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities will be sufficient to support future
realization of net deferred tax assets.

However, we continue
to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets which we do not believe are more likely than not that they would be realized. We continue to apply a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards
and to book write-downs of investments, due to the limited



carryforward period and character of such tax attributes. The amount of this deferred tax asset which continues to be subject to a valuation allowance was
$44.5 million as of June 30, 2006, the date on which we released the valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets, and $51.9 million as of December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $433.2 million, state net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $473.6 million, including federal and state net operating losses related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards of $460.5 million and $265.3 million respectively, when recognized,
will result in a benefit to additional paid-in capital of $172.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $32.3 million.

If we are not able to use our federal net operating loss carryforwards, they
will expire in 2011 through 2026 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2007 through 2024. Most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire, but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the
business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary.

As of
December 31, 2006, we had federal research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately $30.4 million, state research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately $12.6 million.
Included in these amounts are $7.9 million of federal, and $4.5 million of state research credit carryforwards generated from stock option exercises prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The future utilization of these attributes will result in
recognition of the asset and a benefit to additional paid-in capital. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2011 through 2026. State research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely
until utilized.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial
restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. We experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50 percent in 2003
and 2002. These changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $232.9 million and $116.5 million, respectively. Losses not utilized due
to these limitations can be carried forward, but are subject to the expiration dates described in the paragraph above.

Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The amount of such earnings included in consolidated
retained earnings at December 31, 2006 was $121.7 million. These earnings have been permanently reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon. It is not practicable to estimate
the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings.

In the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we were granted relief from the IRS for an uncertainty regarding a tax benefit resulting from a prior divestiture. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit $113.4
million, increased our deferred tax asset for net operating losses from continuing operations $51.8 million, and reduced income taxes payable $61.6 million.

Our effective rate in 2006 differs from 2005 primarily because of the reduction in our valuation allowance, the aforementioned reversal of a tax
uncertainty and the implementation of a new global business structure. Our new international business structure is being implemented to align our asset ownership and business operations with our newly announced functional business structure and the
business needs of the our global customers. In future years, we expect to achieve a lower effective tax rate, as well as business efficiencies, as a result of this new international business structure.

On March 19, 2007, the IRS commenced an examination our federal tax
returns for the year ended December 31, 2004. We currently believe this examination will not have a material impact on our financial statements; however the examination is still in progress.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31,
2006, our principal source of liquidity was $699.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting principally of commercial paper, medium term investment-grade corporate notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and
agency securities and money market funds.

Net cash
provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by
operating activities was $474.8 million in 2006 primarily due to $379.0 million in net income and $55.5 million in adjustments for non-cash charges such as depreciation of property plant and equipment, amortization of other intangible assets,
stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Additionally, cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities activities increased $40.3 million in 2006 primarily due to increase in deferred revenues of $103.8 million and a decrease
in receivables of $32.4 million, offset by an increase of $80.5 million in prepaid and other current assets and a decrease in liabilities in payables and accrued liabilities of $15.4 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $481.1 million in 2005
primarily due $429.0 million in net income and $244.9 million in adjustments in non-cash charges such as depreciation of property plant and equipment, amortization of other intangible assets, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes mostly
offset by a $250.6 million gain from the sale of our payment gateway business. Additionally, cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities activities increased $57.8 million in 2005 primarily due to increase in deferred revenues of
$74.2 million and an increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $75.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in receivables of $67.5 million and an increase of $24.4 million in prepaid and other current assets.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $365.3 million in 2004
primarily due to $152.8 million in net income and $164.0 in adjustments in non-cash charges such as depreciation of property plant and equipment, amortization of other intangible assets, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes.
Additionally, cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities activities increased $48.5 million in 2004 primarily due to increase in deferred revenues of $71.1 million, an increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $37.6 million
and an increase in prepaid and other current assets partially offset by a decrease in receivables of $70.0 million.

Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $562.4 million in 2006, primarily as a result of $604.8 million used for our acquisitions and $181.6 million for
purchases of property and equipment mostly offset by net proceeds from the net sale of investments of approximately $174.7 million and proceeds of $47.8 million from a long-term note receivable.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $143.6 million in 2005,
primarily as a result of net proceeds of $367.2 million from the sale of our payment gateway business and net proceeds of $37.0 million from the net sale of investments, mostly offset by $161.3 million used for our acquisitions and $110.8 million
for purchases of property and equipment.



Net cash used in investing activities was $284.9 million in 2004, primarily as a result of $253.8 million
used for our acquisitions, $15.9 million used for net purchases of investments and $92.5 million for purchases of property and equipment. These were partially offset by $78.3 million in proceeds from the sale of stock in our VeriSign Japan
subsidiary.

Net cash used in financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $110.7
million in 2006 primarily due to $199.0 million in net proceeds received from the draw down of our credit facility and $51.5 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan
purchases, partially offset from $135.0 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market under an existing repurchase program.

Net cash used in financing activities was $469.5 million in 2005 primarily due to $548.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open
market under an existing repurchase program, partially offset by $80.5 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases.

Net cash used in financing activities was $54.5 million in 2004 primarily due
to $113.3 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market under an existing repurchase program, partially offset by $62.4 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee
stock purchase plan purchases.

Net cash provided by
discontinued operations

Net cash used in operating
activities was $1.2 million primarily related to additional services provided after the sale our discontinued payment gateway business after the sale in late 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations for 2005 and
2004 was primarily from net income related to our discontinued payment gateway business of $16.2 million and $17.5 million, respectively.

In 2006 and 2005, we did not receive or use any cash related to investing activities from discontinued operations. Net cash used in investing activities
of discontinued operations was approximately $1.5 million for 2004, primarily for purchases of property and equipment.

Property and Equipment Expenditures

The following table shows our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2007 and our actual expenditures in 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):

is approximately $50.0 million for the construction of a new data facility in New Castle, Delaware.



Contractual
Obligations

The following table summarizes our
significant non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

As of
December 31, 2006, we had commitments under non-cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Future operating lease payments include payments related to leases on excess
facilities included in our restructuring plans. The restructuring liability is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs. Amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the
respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through 2008. Cash payments totaling approximately $4.7 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next two years.

We enter into certain purchase obligations with various vendors. In 2006, we
entered into a $38.6 million construction contract to build our new data facility in Delaware. Our remaining commitments for the facility are $33.0 million, which is expected to be completed in 2007. We also have commitments of approximately $25.5
million in 2007 with various telecommunication providers and approximately $15.1 million in 2007 with various suppliers for software and maintenance contracts.

In 2006, we entered into a contractual agreement with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) to be the sole registry
operator for domain names in the .

com

top-level domain through November 30, 2012. The new agreement introduced a fixed, registry level fee that we will have to pay to ICANN beginning in 2007. Beginning in 2009, the agreement provides for
contingent payments upon meeting certain performance criteria that could amount to an additional $20.5 million through the end of the contract.

In November 1999, we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the Tuvalu country code top-level domain,

.tv

with the
Government of Tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to $4.0 million through 2008.

We have pledged a portion of our short-term investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations,
primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements. We have pledged approximately $4.4 million pursuant to such agreements classified as restricted cash and investments on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. In addition,
we established a trust during the first quarter of 2004 in the amount of $45.0 million classified as restricted cash and investments on our balance sheet for our director and officer liability self-insurance coverage.

Short-term Loan

On June 7, 2006, we entered into a $500 million senior unsecured
revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), under which we, or certain designated subsidiaries may be borrowers. As of December 31, 2006, $199.0 million was borrowed from the Facility, of which $74.0 million was used to refinance our
borrowings under a credit



agreement that expired on July 10, 2006. In addition, on August 31, 2006, VeriSign drew down $125 million on the Facility, which was used for the
purchase of GeoTrust on September 1, 2006. Any other borrowings under the Facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock and other lawful corporate purposes. On
February 28, 2007 we repaid the outstanding balance of $199.0 million on the Facility.

See Note 10 “Credit Facility” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Facility.

Stock Repurchase Program

We repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third
parties.

In 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $350 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase program was completed in the third quarter of 2005. In 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase
program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase was completed in the second quarter of 2006. On May 16, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1
billion stock repurchase program to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. As of December 31, 2006, we have approximately $984.6 million available under the 2006 stock repurchase program.

The table sets forth the total amount of shares repurchased
and net purchase price for the years presented:

From the inception of
the stock purchase program in 2001 to December 31, 2006, a total of 35.3 million shares have been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $865.3 million.

In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer an
indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices, with a total public offering price not to exceed $750 million. To date, no shares have been issued under this registration statement.

If we liquidated certain available-for-sale investments as of
December 31, 2006, we would have recognized losses of approximately $2.0 million in our consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized losses, partially offset by unrecognized gains, are recorded as a separate component of equity and are
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.

We believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Our
philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses, acquisitions,
and share repurchases. We regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets or Financial
Liabilities

” which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and



liabilities at fair value. The objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets
and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes
that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157, “

Fair Value Measurements

” (SFAS 157). We are currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 159 and the impact it will have
on our financial position and results of operations.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS157 does not require any new fair value measurements but
rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided we have not yet issued financial
statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 157 and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”

(SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the
effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 provides transition guidance for correcting errors and requires registrants to quantify misstatements using
both the balance-sheet and income-statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative factors. In the year of adoption only, if the effect of prior periods
uncorrected misstatement is determined to be material, under SAB 108 a registrant is allowed to record the effect as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning-of-year retained earnings. SAB 108 does not change the requirements within SFAS
No. 154, “

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”

for the correction of an error on financial statements. Further, SAB 108 does not change the Staff’s previous guidance in SAB No. 99, “

Materiality”

,
on evaluating the qualitative materiality of misstatements. We were required to adopt SAB 108 in our current fiscal year. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN
48”),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority.
The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income
tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. We are required to adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. The differences between the amounts recognized in the
financial statements prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit. We have evaluated the effect of FIN 48,
and we believe that adoption of this accounting principle will result in a decrease to our accumulated deficit in the first quarter of 2007 of $38.6 million, an increase to non-current deferred tax assets of $28.7 million, and a decrease to
income taxes payable of $9.9 million

.

In June
2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-3 (“EITF 06-3”), “

How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement”

. EITF 06-3
provides guidance on an entity’s disclosure of its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain taxes and provides that if taxes included in gross revenues are significant, a company should disclose the amount of such
taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented (i.e., both interim and annual periods). Taxes within the scope of EITF 06-3 are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction. The guidance is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning



after December 15, 2006. We have evaluated the effect of EITF 06-3, and we believe the impact will be immaterial on our financial position and results
of operations.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Equity investments

We invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes. In most instances, we invest in the equity and debt securities of
private companies for which there is no public market, and therefore, carry a high level of risk. These companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near-term. Therefore, these
companies may never become publicly traded. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we determined the decline in value of
certain public and non-public equity investments was other-than-temporary and we recognized impairments totaling $0.4 million, $0.8 million, and $12.6 million, respectively. Due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments, we may
incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments.

Interest
rate sensitivity

The primary objective of our short-term
investment management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after-tax returns. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of
debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities. We invest in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. In
general, money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. As of December 31, 2006, 68% of our investments subject to interest rate
risk mature in less than one year.

Notwithstanding our efforts
to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any time, a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value
of our investment portfolio. The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our fixed income securities in our short-term investment portfolio as of December 31, 2006, arising from potential changes in interest rates.
The modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 25 basis points (“BPS”), 50 BPS, 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

The following table
presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short-term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2006. This table does not include money market
funds because those funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk.



Foreign exchange risk management

We conduct business throughout the world and transact in
multiple foreign currencies. As we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to
mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non-functional currencies. The primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from
fluctuations in exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The
program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months.

At December 31, 2006, we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately $182.4 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. All forward contracts are recorded at fair market value. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high-quality financial institutions.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Financial Statements

VeriSign’s financial statements required by this item are set forth as a separate section of this Form 10-K. See Item 15 (a)1 for a listing of
financial statements provided in the section titled “Financial Statements.”

Supplemental Data (Unaudited)

The following
tables set forth unaudited supplementary quarterly financial data for the two year period ended December 31, 2006. In management’s opinion, the unaudited data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the data for the periods presented.

The following tables for selected quarterly unaudited supplementary quarterly financial information have been restated for all quarters of fiscal 2005 and
the first quarter of fiscal 2006 from previously reported information filed on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. All previously reported quarters of fiscal 2005 have been adjusted to show the discontinued operations from the sale of our payments gateway
service in November 2005. Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied upon.



(1)

Net income (loss) per share is computed independently for each of the quarters represented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
“

Earnings per Share

”. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net income (loss) per share may not equal the total computed for the fiscal year or any cumulative interim period.

(2)

Net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006 includes a $21.7 million gain on from sale of our remaining equity stake in Network Solutions that was previously written
off.

(3)

Net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, includes the release of our valuation allowance of $236.4 million from our deferred tax assets resulting in a
non-recurring benefit to tax expense and a $113.3 million tax benefit that was the result of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service relating to an uncertain tax position on a capital loss generated in 2003.

(4)

Net income for 2005 includes gain on sale of discontinued operations of $250.6 million, and other charges of approximately $21.6 million related to the abandonment of the
development efforts related to an internally developed software project.

Our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and should not be relied
upon as an indication of future performance. Also, operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future quarters. If this were to occur, the market price of our common stock
would likely decline. For more information regarding the quarterly fluctuation of our revenues and operating results, see Item 1A “Risk Factors—Our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are
uncertain.”

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As discussed in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this report, the Ad Hoc Group of independent directors of the Board of Directors conducted a
review of our historical stock option granting practices for the period January 1998 through May 2006. During the course of the review, the Ad Hoc Group identified stock option grants with incorrect measurement dates, without required
documentation, or with initial grant dates and exercise prices that were subsequently modified. Consequently, we have recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option grants. In
this Form 10-K, we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Details of the
restatement and its underlying circumstances are discussed in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this report and in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this report.

a. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of
December 31, 2006. We determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. Notwithstanding the material weakness discussed below, our management,
based upon the substantial work performed during the preparation of this report and the related restatement of historical financial information, has concluded that our consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this
report are prepared in accordance generally accepted accounting principals in the U.S. and fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented herein.

b. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 using the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).

A material weakness is a
control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Based on our evaluation under the
COSO framework, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 arising from a combination of the following control deficiencies in our stock administration policies and
practices:

•

Failure to consistently implement and apply policies and procedures related to the approval of equity-based grants to executive officers, retention grants and
grants made in connection with new hires, promotions, and annual performance reviews.



•

Lack of complete and timely reconciliation of grants and cancellations from our stock administration database to our financial reporting systems; lack of consistent
reconciliation of grant dates in the system of record to supporting documentation.

•

Inadequate supervision and training of personnel involved with the equity-based grant processes.

•

Lack of effective coordination and communication among the Human Resources Department, Accounting Department and Legal Department in connection with the
administration of equity-based grants.

Accordingly, we concluded that the control deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.

A material weakness comprised of similar control deficiencies to those noted
above resulted in material errors to, and the restatement of, the 2005 and 2004 annual consolidated financial statements and the condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods in 2005 and for the interim period ended
March 31, 2006.

As a result of the material weakness
described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
COSO.

The Company acquired m-Qube, Inc. (“m-Qube”)
and inCode Telecom Group, Inc. (“inCode”) on May 1, 2006 and November 30, 2006, respectively. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 m-Qube’s
and inCode’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $316,131,000 and $89,656,000, respectively, and total revenues of $26,985,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, included in the consolidated financial statements
of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

c. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Subsequent to December 31, 2006, our Board of Directors approved
additional internal control policies and procedures intended to remediate the material weakness described above. As of the date of this filing, we have implemented or are in the process of implementing the following corrective actions:

•

Develop and implement detailed equity-based grant policies and procedures and related compensation and human resources practices, including procedures to ensure
accurate and timely communication of Compensation Committee actions.

•

Validation of critical stock administration data fields including employee termination dates and stock option cancellation dates.

•

Designation of individuals in the legal and accounting departments to oversee the documentation of, and accounting for, equity-based grants.

•

Additional training for our finance, human resource, stock administration, and legal personnel concerning the equity grant process and the accounting and financial
reporting for equity awards and modifications of such awards.

•

Awarding equity-based grants (new hire, promotion, and annual performance) at pre-determined dates, with all required approvals documented and finalized on or
before those dates.

•

Improving the coordination and communication among the human resources, accounting and legal departments to identify, in advance, accounting issues relating to
equity-based awards, and to ensure that those awards are properly accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles.



Additionally, we are
investing in ongoing efforts to continuously improve the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and have committed considerable resources to the improvement of the design, implementation, documentation, testing and monitoring of
our internal controls.

As of the date of this filing, we
believe that we have made substantial progress in the implementation of the corrective actions noted above and toward remediation of the material weakness.

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the three months ended December 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent material errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The continued effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting is subject to risks, including that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9B.

position with VeriSign.

On July 9, 2007, VeriSign entered into
a Consulting and Separation Agreement with Mr. Sclavos in connection with his resignation on May 27, 2007. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Mr. Sclavos will provide consulting services to the Company for a one-year period at the
rate of $5,000 per month and is prohibited from engaging in certain competitive activities or soliciting customers of the Company during such period. The Company will pay Mr. Sclavos severance of $1,969,380 within twenty-one (21) days of the
effective date of the agreement and $1,969,380 on June 15, 2008, subject to his compliance with the terms of the agreement. In the event of a change-in-control of the Company, all severance payments will accelerate and become immediately due
and payable.

The Company accelerated all of
Mr. Sclavos’ outstanding options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and restricted stock units that are scheduled to vest within twenty-four (24) months after Mr. Sclavos’ resignation. Accordingly, vesting for
restricted stock units with respect to approximately 156,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and the following stock options were accelerated:

With respect to an option to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise
price of $10.08 that was previously granted to Mr. Sclavos, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the exercise price of such option should be increased, then the exercise price of the unexercised portion of such option will be
increased and with respect to the portion of such option that may have been exercised, Mr. Sclavos agrees to repay the Company the difference between the increased exercise price and the original exercise price.

our directors and officers, and persons who own more than 10% of VeriSign’s common stock to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market. These persons are required by SEC
regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.

Based solely on our review of the copy of the forms furnished to us and written representations from the executive officers and directors, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our directors and
executive officers were timely met except that John M. Donovan had one delinquent filing on Form 3 and each of Aristotle N. Balogh, Dana L. Evan, Vernon L. Irvin, Robert J. Korzeniewski, Judy Lin and James M. Ulam had one delinquent filing on Form 4

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Audit Committee

The Board of Directors has established an audit committee that has responsibility for oversight of our financial, accounting and reporting processes and
our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the appointment, termination, compensation and oversight of our independent auditors, including conducting a review of their independence, reviewing and approving the planned scope of our annual
audit, overseeing the independent auditors’ audit work, reviewing and pre-approving any non-audit services that may be performed by the independent auditors, reviewing with management and our independent auditors the adequacy of our internal
financial controls, and reviewing our critical accounting policies and the application of accounting principles. The audit committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Chenevich, Moore and Mueller. Each member of the audit committee meets the
independence criteria of The Nasdaq Stock Market and the SEC. Each audit committee member meets The Nasdaq Stock Market’s financial knowledge requirements, and the Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Mueller is “financially
sophisticated” as such term is defined in Rule 4350(d)(2)(A) of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The audit committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which complies with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market. A copy of the audit committee charter is located on our website at

Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. We are currently searching for a new director to fill this role.



ITEM 11.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Overview

The goal of our executive officer compensation program is to create long-term value for our stockholders. Toward this goal, we have designed and
implemented our compensation programs for our executives to reward them for sustained financial and operating performance and leadership excellence, to align their interests with those of our stockholders and to encourage them to remain with the
Company into the future. Most of our compensation elements are designed to simultaneously fulfill one or more of our performance, alignment and retention objectives. In deciding on the type and amount of compensation for each executive, we focus on
both current pay and the opportunity for future compensation. We combine the compensation elements for each executive in a manner we believe optimizes the executive’s contribution to the Company.

Role of the Compensation Committee

The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Compensation
Committee”) is responsible for oversight of our compensation plans and benefit programs. The Compensation Committee sets and administers the policies governing compensation of our executive officers and our other employees. The Compensation
Committee annually reviews and approves the base salary, incentive bonus and long-term incentive compensation of our executive officers and also reviews and approves the annual incentive bonus program and long-term incentive compensation program for
our non-officer employees. Health and welfare benefits, perquisites, severance and change-in-control benefits are also reviewed regularly by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee reviews recommendations from the Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) in connection with the review and approval of compensation of executive officers (other than the CEO). The CEO annually reviews the performance of each executive officer (other than the CEO whose performance is reviewed by
the Committee). The CEO is responsible for making a recommendation regarding the salary, incentive bonus and long-term incentive compensation for each executive officer (other than himself) based on his assessment of the performance of each
individual. The CEO is assisted by the Human Resources Department in formulating these recommendations. The CEO takes an active part in the discussions at Committee meetings at which the compensation of his direct reports is discussed. All decisions
regarding the CEO’s compensation are made by the Committee in executive session, without the CEO present. The Committee may accept or reject, in whole or in part, the recommendations of the CEO and the Human Resources Department. Similarly,
recommendations made by the Committee’s outside advisors may also be accepted, rejected or modified by the Committee.

Executive Compensation Philosophy, Framework and Implementation

VeriSign operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing business environment. Our executive compensation program seeks to motivate executives to
achieve our business objectives, foster teamwork, and attract and retain highly talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success.

Our executive officer compensation program is based on the following principles:

•

Performance:

a significant portion of each executive officer’s total compensation should depend on the achievement of corporate
objectives and the creation of stockholder value. Compensation should be directly and substantially linked to measurable corporate and individual performance, and provide incentives for superior performance that will drive demonstrable business
impact;

•

Alignment:

compensation should closely align the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders;
and

•

Retention

:    compensation should be competitive with that offered by other leading high technology companies we view as our peers and as
competitors for the employment of talented executives.



We use a combination of base salary and benefits, annual incentive bonus, and long-term incentive
compensation, such as stock options and restricted stock units, to achieve our objectives. The combined mix of compensation elements allows us to provide a competitive total rewards package for our executive officers that reflects our
pay-for-performance philosophy. The Compensation Committee exercises its discretion in determining compensation for our executive officers, and compensation decisions are made after reviewing the performance of the Company and each executive’s
performance during the year against established goals, current compensation arrangements, market trends, and the compensation history of the executive officer relative to the other executives. Specific factors affecting compensation decisions
include:

•

key financial measurements such as revenue and cash flow, as well as non-GAAP operating income, operating margin, and
earnings per share


•

strategic objectives, such as acquisitions, divestitures, innovation and segment expansion

•

organizational development improvements relative to the executive’s organizational responsibility and among their employees

•

adherence to the Company’s values.

Benchmarking

VeriSign uses a benchmarking process to help determine base salary, annual incentive bonus and long-term incentive compensation targets for our executive
officers. The Compensation Committee engages a third party executive compensation consulting firm to undertake an annual study of competitive compensation practices for executive officers at certain high technology companies that we view as our
peers or as competitors for talent. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews VeriSign’s financial performance against these peers to assess the degree to which executive performance aligns with the metrics set by our peers.

The Compensation
Committee targets total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive bonus) between the 50

th

and

th

percentile of the compensation peer group. Long-term incentive compensation is targeted at the 75

th

percentile of the compensation peer group. Total direct compensation (base salary plus annual incentive bonus plus long-term
incentive compensation) is targeted at the 75

th

percentile of the compensation peer group. Adjustments to total
compensation are made based on the executive’s individual performance in the prior year relative to his peers, the executive’s future potential with the Company, and the scope of the executive’s responsibilities and experience. The
Compensation Committee believes that setting base salary, bonus and long-term incentive compensation targets at these levels is necessary in order to effectively attract, retain and motivate talented executives while enabling the Company to
differentiate between executives, levels of performance and responsibility.

Other elements of compensation, including health and welfare benefits, perquisites, and severance and change-in-control payments and benefits are reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to ensure that our
total compensation is competitive based on data obtained from various sources at the time of the review.

VeriSign’s compensation peer group is principally made up of publicly-traded companies in the high technology sector that are our direct business
competitors and with which we compete for executive talent.

The compensation peer group is comparable to VeriSign with regard to labor market competition, market capitalization, revenue and number of employees. The compensation peer group is reviewed annually and adjustments are made as necessary to
ensure the group continues to appropriately reflect the competitive market for key talent and includes companies similar to VeriSign in scope and complexity.


Non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are
included in GAAP: amortization of purchased intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock-based compensation expense, litigation settlements, gain/loss from the Jamba joint venture, restructuring, impairment of assets and
acquisition-related reserve costs, impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets, internal review costs, release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the net gain/loss or impairment of investments.



For 2006, the compensation
peer group consisted of the following companies:

On May 1, 2007,
the Compensation Committee determined that the compensation peer group for 2007 and 2008 would consist of the following companies:

The Compensation
Committee also reviews annually the executive pay practices of other similarly situated companies as reported in industry surveys, reports from compensation consulting firms and other public data. These surveys are specific to the high technology
sector and the Company utilizes customized reports of these surveys so that the compensation data reflect the practices of companies that are as similar in scope and complexity to VeriSign as possible. This information is also considered when making
recommendations for each compensation element.

Role of Compensation
Consultant

Compensia, Inc. (“Compensia”)
serves as an independent compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee. Compensia reports directly to the Compensation Committee and assists it in evaluating and analyzing the Company’s executive compensation program, principles and
objectives, as well as the specific compensation and benefit design recommendations presented by the Company’s executive management. The Compensation Committee recently engaged Frederick W. Cook & Co., Inc. to serve as its independent
compensation consultant. VeriSign’s Human Resources Department also provides support to the Compensation Committee in carrying out its duties at the request and under the direction of the Compensation Committee.

Elements of Compensation Program

Base Salary.

Base salaries of our executive
officers, including our CEO, are determined annually. Actual base salary levels are established based upon each executive officer’s job responsibilities and experience, individual contributions and future potential, with reference to base
salary levels of executives at other high technology companies we view as our peers. As described above, we target a percentile above the median as determined by a benchmarking analysis in setting the total cash compensation (base salary and annual
incentive bonus) for each executive officer.

Annual
Incentive Bonus.

VeriSign has established the VeriSign Performance Plan (“VPP”), an annual cash bonus plan that is designed to reward members of the executive team and other employees for their contributions to
the success of the Company. A substantial portion of each executive officer’s cash compensation is paid, if earned, in the form of the VPP bonus. Target bonus levels for our executive officers are established in part by reference to bonus
levels of executives at other high technology companies we view as our peers as determined by our benchmarking analysis.



The VPP bonus is based upon the achievement of specified corporate, business unit and/or functional
goals, including achievement of a minimum performance threshold and individual performance. All non-sales employees are eligible to participate in the annual incentive bonus program.

The Compensation Committee, working with the executive
management team, annually establishes the corporate and business unit and/or functional goals. These goals include financial, strategic and operational objectives, such as achieving measurable progress with key customer accounts and leadership
development. The Compensation Committee determines the amount of annual incentive bonus, if any, that will be paid to the CEO and our other executive officers for achievement of the prior year’s goals. As part of this process, the Compensation
Committee reviews recommendations from the CEO in connection with the review and approval of each executive officer’s annual incentive bonus, other than the CEO. The Compensation Committee also reviews and approves the budget for the VPP
program for employees who are not executive officers and has delegated authority to the executive management team to administer the VPP for these employees.

Long-term Incentive Compensation.

Long-term incentive compensation consists of non-qualified stock options and restricted
stock units and is intended to align the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders by focusing the efforts of our executive officers on the long-term success of the Company as reflected in increases to
VeriSign’s stock price over a period of several years, growth in its financial results and other measures. Long-term incentive awards are established based upon each executive officer’s job responsibilities and experience, individual
contributions and future potential, with reference to long-term incentive award levels of executives at other high technology companies we view as our peers as determined by our benchmarking analysis. In 2006, we awarded non-qualified stock options
and restricted stock units to our executive officers that contain vesting terms over a four-year period: twenty-five percent (25%) of each stock option award vests one year after the date of grant and quarterly thereafter until fully vested;
twenty-five percent (25%) of each restricted stock award vests annually on each anniversary of the date of grant until fully vested. We believe that providing combined grants of stock options and restricted stock units effectively balances our
objective of focusing our executives on delivering long term value to our stockholders, with our providing value to executives with the equity awards.

In February 2006, the Compensation Committee used a benchmarking analysis to evaluate the
competitive positioning of long-term incentive compensation for our executive officers. For 2006, long-term incentive compensation was targeted at the 75

th

percentile of the compensation peer group; however, stock options and restricted stock units were also granted to executives based on the individual’s expected contribution to the Company’s
future success, as well as the individual’s past performance. The Compensation Committee also considered the number of unvested stock options and restricted stock units held by each executive officer. 75% of the total award value was granted in
the form of non-qualified stock options and 25% of the total award value was granted in the form of restricted stock units. Stock options were granted in August 2006 to executive officers with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
VeriSign common stock on the date of grant, which was the date the Compensation Committee approved such awards.

Stock options and restricted stock units have value for executive officers only if the individual remains an employee for the applicable vesting period,
and, in the case of stock options, only if the price of VeriSign’s stock increases above the exercise price of the option. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and typically vest over
a four-year period with 25% of the option shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and the remaining option shares vesting ratably each quarter thereafter until fully vested. Restricted stock units typically vest over four years as
follows: 25% on the first anniversary of the grant, and 25% on each of the subsequent three anniversary dates. Vesting in all cases is subject to the individual’s continued provision of services to VeriSign through the vesting date.

VeriSign is cognizant of stockholder concerns about stock usage and
dilution. As a consequence, management and the Compensation Committee have taken the following steps to manage employee equity grants:

•

VeriSign reviewed its equity compensation practices in connection with the stock option-related accounting changes promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board and the impact such



changes have on VeriSign’s financial statements. The purpose of this review was to determine whether alternative forms of equity compensation could
strengthen the link between executive and employee reward opportunities and the creation of long-term stockholder value. The Board of Directors concluded that stock options continue to be an appropriate equity compensation tool for VeriSign’s
executives officers, but the use of performance shares (full-value stock award units based on the achievement of pre-established goals) in the future as part of the composition of equity compensation for the CEO and other executives will allow the
Company to reward executives for sustained performance against key long-term performance measures, as well as performance relative to our peers, which is how many of our stockholders measure the Company’s performance.

•

VeriSign is committed to limit annual net issuances of stock-based awards to employees to 3% or less of the number of shares of common stock outstanding, excluding
extraordinary events, such as acquisitions.

Benefits.

Executive officers, like other employees, participate in a number of benefit programs designed to enable VeriSign to attract and retain employees in a competitive marketplace. The Company provides
executive officers the same health and welfare benefits provided generally to all other employees, at the same general premium rates charged to such employees, with the exception of the Group Voluntary Universal Life insurance benefit and certain
executive perquisites described below. The health and welfare benefits include medical, dental and vision insurance and other health benefits, as well as paid time off, an employee stock purchase plan, and a qualified 401(k) plan. The Group
Voluntary Universal Life insurance benefit is open to all U.S.-based employees with an annual salary of $110,000 or greater. All of our Named Executive Officers (as defined in the “Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2006” section of
this report) participate in this program which provides two times salary in basic life insurance as well as the opportunity to purchase optional life insurance.

Perquisites.

Other than those benefits described above, the Company generally provides no additional or supplemental
benefits, such as a company automobile, club memberships, deferred compensation programs, or retirement benefits, to its executive officers. However, between 2004 and 2006, the Company paid country club membership fees and monthly dues on behalf of
Mr. Irvin. In 2006, Mr. Irvin received compensation of $9,634 as reimbursement for country club dues.

Total Compensation.

VeriSign believes we are fulfilling our
compensation objectives and rewarding executive officers in a manner that is consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Executive compensation is tied directly to our performance and is structured to ensure that there is an appropriate
balance between the Company’s long-term and short-term performance, and also provides a balance between our operational performance and stockholder return. On average, targeted total cash compensation (base salary plus annual incentive bonus)
for our Named Executive Officers in 2006 was at the 65th percentile of the market as determined by reference to our compensation peer group and the average resulting targeted pay mix was 23% base salary, 15% annual incentive bonus and 62% long-term
inventive compensation. On average, targeted total direct compensation (base salary plus annual incentive bonus plus long-term incentive compensation) was slightly above the 75

th

percentile of market as determined by reference to our compensation peer group due to emphasis we placed on long-term incentives.

Equity Award Practices

.    Equity-based grants,
which include stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), are an important element of VeriSign’s total compensation program and are designed to support the Company’s pay-for-performance philosophy in addition to providing
a direct link between employee rewards and increased stockholder value. Equity-based awards are typically granted in connection with new hires and promotions and annually in connection with the Company’s Stock Recognition Award program that is
designed to reward for employees who are considered key contributors to VeriSign’s continued success. Except for equity awards made in connection with new hires and promotions, equity awards to executive officers and other employees are
generally made annually. Details regarding the grants, including the type of grants, the terms of the grants, the recipients, and the size of the grants, are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. Each year, the Compensation Committee
establishes guidelines for the granting of equity-based awards in connection with new hires and promotions based on recommendations from management and consideration of a



number of factors including the dilutive impact of grants that are expected to be made in the coming year, the current number of outstanding options and
RSUs, and the rate at which the Company expects to issue equity grants.

Equity-based awards made in connection with the Company’s Stock Recognition Award program are granted on the date the Compensation Committee approves the awards, which is usually the Compensation Committee meeting held in August of
each year. The exercise price of each stock option awarded to our employees, including our executive officers, is the closing price of VeriSign stock on the date of grant.

Automatic Grants for New Hires and
Promotions

.    When an employee is hired or promoted, the employee may be eligible to receive an equity award. Unless the individual is an executive officer or the grant exceeds the range approved by the Compensation
Committee in its equity guidelines, the grant is made automatically on the 15

th

day of the month as follows: If the
date of the new hire or promotion occurs before the 15

th

day of the month, the grant is made automatically on the

th

day of the month (unless that day is not a day that the NASDAQ Stock Market is open for trading (“Trading
Day”) in which case the grant is made on the preceding Trading Day. If the date of the new hire or promotion occurs on or after the 15

th

day of the month, the grant will be made automatically on the 15

th

day of the next month
(unless that day is not a Trading Day in which case the grant is made on the preceding Trading Day). If the individual is an executive officer or the grant exceeds the range approved by the Compensation Committee in its equity guidelines, the
Compensation Committee must approve the equity award.

Tax and Accounting
Treatment of Executive Compensation

In determining
the amount and form of compensation paid each year to its executive officers, the Company takes into account both the tax treatment and the accounting treatment of such compensation. However, the tax and accounting treatment of various forms of
compensation is subject to changes in, and changing interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations and rules, as well as other factors not necessarily within the Company’s control. Thus, tax and accounting treatment is merely one of many
factors that the Company takes into account in designing certain elements of compensation.

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limits the federal income tax deduction for compensation paid to each Named Executive Officers to $1,000,000 per year for public companies, unless
the compensation is performance-based. VeriSign’s executive compensation is structured to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by the Company when, in its judgment, it is appropriate and in the interest of the Company
and its stockholders. The deductibility of an executive officer’s compensation can depend upon the timing of the executive officer’s vesting or exercise of previously granted rights, as well as other factors beyond the Company’s
control. Therefore an executive officer’s compensation is not necessarily limited to that which is deductible under Section 162(m). The Compensation Committee may approve payment of compensation that exceeds the deductibility limitation
under Section 162(m) in order to meet compensation objectives or if it determines that doing so is otherwise in the interest of our stockholders. Having considered the requirements of Section 162(m), we believe that the stock option awards
made in 2006 pursuant to the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan meet the requirements that such grants be “performance based” and are, therefore, exempt from the limitations on deductibility, and that the restricted stock units awarded are not
performance based and are therefore, not exempt from the limitations on deductibility.

Restricted stock units granted under the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan and options granted under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan in 2006 may not be deductible depending on the date that such restricted stock units vest or
the options are exercised. The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan does not meet the requirements of Section 162(m). For 2006, all compensation, excluding restricted stock unit awards, provided to our named executive officers, other than Stratton D.
Sclavos, our former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, was fully deductible by the Company. Mr. Sclavos’ non-deductible compensation for 2006 was $1,074,617 and was attributed primarily to the non-deductibility
of his 2005 VPP Bonus payment, paid in 2006, as well as the non-deductibility of restricted stock unit awards.



Share Ownership Guidelines

In addition to aligning interests between executives
and stockholders through stock options and restricted stock units, the Board of Directors adopted a stock ownership policy that requires executive officers to own shares of VeriSign common stock. Executive officers are required to own VeriSign
common stock in an amount not less than three times their annual base salary (calculated using the executive’s 2005 base salary for individuals who were executive officers at the time of the policy’s adoption or, for officers appointed
after the policy’s adoption, the executive’s initial base salary at the time the individual was appointed as an executive officer). Company stock that counts toward satisfaction of these stock ownership guidelines includes: shares owned
outright by the officer and his or her immediate family members who share the same household, whether held individually or jointly; restricted stock where the restrictions have lapsed; shares acquired and held upon stock option exercises; and shares
obtained through open market purchases. Shares held in trust may also be included, subject to the approval of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the lead independent director. Each executive officer has five years from the later of the date
of the adoption of the requirement or of the individual becoming an executive officer, to attain the minimum level of ownership. The stock ownership policy is included in VeriSign’s Corporate Governance Principles which can be found on our
website at

http://investor.verisign.com/governance.cfm

.

Because the Company grants stock-based incentives in order to align the interests of its employees with those of its stockholders, the Company’s Securities Trading Policy forbids executive officers and other employees from buying or
selling derivative securities related to VeriSign common stock, such as puts or calls on VeriSign common stock, as derivative securities may diminish the alignment that the Company is trying to foster. Company-issued stock options and restricted
stock units are not transferable during the executive officer’s life, other than certain gifts to family members (or trusts, partnerships, etc., that benefit family members).

Compensation for the Named Executive Officers

The specific compensation decisions made for each of the Named Executive Officers for 2006 reflect the performance of the
Company against key financial and operational measurements. A detailed analysis of our financial and operational performance is contained in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Financial Disclosure
elsewhere in this report.

CEO Compensation

In February 2006, the
Compensation Committee established Mr. Sclavos’ base salary for 2006 after reviewing his personal performance and achievement against 2005 corporate financial, strategic and operational goals, his compensation history and relevant
benchmarking data. Corporate financial goals included measurements against revenue and cash flow targets, as well as non-GAAP operating income, operating margin and earnings per share targets.


Strategic goals included
growth targets for existing services, goals for development of new product and service offerings, achievement of specified milestones regarding major customer accounts, expansion of international revenues, leverage of synergy opportunities,
successful mergers and acquisitions activity, operational excellence, broadening strategic alliances, and continued improvement in the Company’s operational infrastructure. Operational goals included organizational development objectives and
leadership development initiatives.

After reviewing
Mr. Sclavos’ performance against 2005 goals, personal performance and relevant benchmarking data, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Sclavos’ base salary by 4.2% to $937,800 which


Non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are
included in GAAP: amortization of purchased intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock-based compensation expense, litigation settlements, gain/loss from the Jamba joint venture, restructuring, impairment of assets and
acquisition-related reserve costs, impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets, internal review costs, release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the net gain/loss or impairment of investments.



is approximately the 70

th

percentile of our compensation peer group. The Compensation Committee also, within the same review process, awarded a 2005 performance bonus payment of $1,160,027, or 117% of the target bonus.

In August 2006, as part of the Company’s annual Stock Recognition Award
program process, and based on an evaluation of Company performance, Mr. Sclavos’ leadership performance, and market data as determined by reference to our compensation peer group, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Sclavos 583,000
non qualified stock options and 64,800 restricted stock units. These grants were subject to our customary four-year vesting terms and were the only long-term incentive compensation awards granted to Mr. Sclavos in 2006.

At the time the Compensation Committee met to determine 2007 base salaries
for executive officers, the restatement of certain historical financial statement related to the review of historical stock option granting practices by the Ad Hoc Group described in the Explanatory Note in Note 2 “Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, was ongoing. As a consequence, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee determined to defer consideration of Mr. Sclavos’ 2007 compensation until
after the restatement was completed. On May 27, 2007, Mr. Sclavos resigned from the Company and the Board of Directors appointed William A. Roper, Jr. as the Chief Executive Officer and President. Prior to his resignation, Mr. Sclavos
received no annual salary increase or annual incentive bonus based on his performance and achievement against the personal, corporate financial, strategic and operational goals established for 2006. The terms of Mr. Roper’s compensation
have not yet been determined.

CFO and Other Named Executive Officers

2006 Base Salary.

In
determining the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers for 2006 (other than the CEO and Mr. Donovan), the Compensation Committee evaluated each individual’s personal performance and achievement against 2005 corporate financial,
strategic and operational goals, his or her compensation history and relevant benchmarking data. The CEO reviewed with the Compensation Committee the performance of each executive officer during 2005.

The table below summarizes the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers
(other than our CEO) in 2006.

The Compensation
Committee approved the increases in Ms. Evan’s, Mr. Irvin’s, and Mr. Korzeniewski’s base salaries after a review of relevant benchmarking information, as well as performance information and recommendations provided by
the CEO.

Mr. McLaughlin was promoted to Executive Vice
President effective on March 11, 2006, and the Compensation Committee approved an increase in his base salary to reflect the desired salary level for our executives and after a review of relevant benchmarking information.

The base salary for Mr. Donovan, the former Chief Executive Officer of
inCode Telecom Group, Inc. (“inCode”), was set at $450,000 per annum at the time of our acquisition of inCode on November 30, 2006 and is based upon our review of base salaries for similarly situated positions in the market.



2007 Base
Salary.

In determining the base salaries for our Named Executive Officers (other than our former CEO) for 2007, the Compensation Committee evaluated each individual’s personal performance and achievement against 2006
corporate financial, strategic and operational goals, his or her compensation history and relevant benchmarking data. The CEO reviewed with the Compensation Committee the performance of each executive officer during 2006.

The table below summarizes the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers
(other than our former CEO) in 2007. The effective date of the base salary increases was May 1, 2007.

As
Mr. Donovan’s base salary was determined in November 2006 in connection with the acquisition of inCode Telecom Group, Inc. (“inCode”), no adjustment was deemed necessary to his base salary for 2007.

At the time the Compensation Committee met to determine 2007 base salaries
for executive officers, the restatement of certain historical financial statement related to the review of historical stock option granting practices by the Ad Hoc Group described in the Explanatory Note that appears at the beginning of this report
was ongoing. As a consequence, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee determined to defer consideration of Ms. Evan’s 2007 compensation until after the restatement was completed. On July 10, 2007, Ms. Evan resigned
from Company. Ms. Evan had been our Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer.

The Compensation Committee approved the increase in Mr. Korzeniewski’s base salary after a review of relevant benchmarking information, as well
as performance information and recommendations provided by the CEO.

The base salary increase for Mr. McLaughlin reflects a material increase in responsibility following a corporate reorganization and his new and significantly expanded role as Executive Vice President of Products and Marketing in
January 2007.

Mr. Irvin resigned from the Company on
October 31, 2006.

Annual Incentive
Bonus.

In determining the annual incentive bonuses payable in 2007 for performance in 2006 to our Named Executive Officers (other than the CEO), the Compensation Committee evaluated each individual’s personal
performance and achievement against 2006 corporate financial goals (as described in the CEO Compensation section above), strategic and operational goals, his or her compensation history and relevant benchmarking data.

For 2006, target bonuses were established at 60% of base salary. In February
and again in May 2007, the Compensation Committee met with executive management to review the performance of executive officers and certify achievement against corporate and business unit goals and individual objectives for 2006.



In May 2007, the CEO made recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding annual incentive bonus
amounts for each of the executive officers (other than the CEO and Mr. Irvin). These recommendations, other than the recommendation for Ms. Evan, were approved by the Compensation Committee. The annual VPP bonuses paid in 2007 for
performance in 2006 to executive officers was as follows:

Mr. Donovan
joined VeriSign in November 2006, and therefore he was not eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus as part of the VPP for 2006. In 2007, Mr. Donovan received a bonus payment of $24,000 in connection with his service as Chief Executive
Officer of inCode during 2006. In addition, in 2006, VeriSign paid Mr. Donovan $5,000,000 pursuant to the terms of an inCode Management Retention Plan.

At the time the Compensation Committee met to determine 2007 base salaries for executive officers, the restatement of certain historical financial
statement related to the review of historical stock option granting practices by the Ad Hoc Group described in the Explanatory Note that appears at the beginning of this report, was ongoing. As a consequence, the Board of Directors and the
Compensation Committee decided to defer consideration of Ms. Evan’s 2006 annual incentive bonus until after the restatement was completed. On July 10, 2007, Ms. Evan resigned from Company. Ms. Evan had been our Executive
Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer. The material terms of any separation agreement that may be entered into between the Company and Ms. Evan will be disclosed as required under applicable regulations of the
SEC.

Mr. Irvin resigned from the Company on
October 31, 2006. In March 2007, under the terms of his severance agreement, Mr. Irvin was paid an annual incentive bonus based on his service through October 31, 2006. The material terms of Mr. Irvin’s severance arrangement
are summarized in the “Separation and Change-in-Control Payments and Benefits” section below.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

.    In August 2006, the Compensation Committee approved long-term incentive awards in the form
of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Donovan who was not an employee of the Company at that time). In establishing the amount of long-term incentives to award each individual,
the Committee compared the total value of the proposed long-term incentive awards to the market benchmark data. As described above, in 2006, the Company’s objective was to target long term incentive compensation at approximately the
75th percentile of market data; however, stock options and restricted stock units were also granted to executives based on the individual’s expected contribution to the Company’s future success, as well as the individual’s past
performance. The Committee also considered the number of unvested stock options and restricted stock units held by each executive officer. 75% of the total award value was granted in the form of non-qualified stock options and 25% of the total award
value was granted in the form of restricted stock units.

In
May 2006, the Compensation Committee awarded Mark McLaughlin 40,000 non-qualified stock options and 4,200 RSUs in connection with his promotion to Executive Vice President and General Manager, Information Services. This award took into consideration
Mr. McLaughlin’s level of responsibility and historical equity awards, and was granted in accordance with the Company’s equity guidelines for promotional grants.

Mr. Donovan was appointed Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Consulting Services, in November 2006, in
connection with our acquisition of inCode. At that time, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Donovan 200,000 non-qualified stock options and 25,000 restricted stock units.



The table below summarizes
the long-term incentive awards granted to our Named Executive Officers (other than our former CEO) in 2006.

The Compensation
Committee and management are currently reviewing the Company’s approach to long-term incentive compensation plan for executive officers for 2007.

Elections Related to Section 409A-Affected Options.

As disclosed in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this
report, four of VeriSign’s current and former executive officers and a current director holding Affected Options elected to increase the exercise price of their Affected Options to the market price on December 31, 2006. Accordingly,
effective December 31, 2006, the exercise prices of Affected Options held by D. James Bidzos, a current board member, Dana Evan, Chief Financial Officer, Robert Korzeniewski, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, Judy Lin, former
Executive Vice President of Security Services and Mark McLaughlin, Executive Vice President of Products and Marketing, were adjusted so that these options will not be subject to Section 409A. The Company has not made a determination whether
compensation will be paid to any of these individuals in connection with this election.

Relocation Agreements.

Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Donovan’s employment offer letter, the Company will reimburse Mr. Donovan up to $1.5 million for expenses related to his
relocation to Mountain View, California. Through June 2007, VeriSign reimbursed Mr. Donovan approximately $1,366,827 for relocation expenses, including relocation allowance, transportation of family members and household goods, house hunting
trips, temporary maintenance, closing costs associated with the sale and purchase of his residence, and other miscellaneous expenses related to the relocation.

Reimbursement Payments to Mr. Sclavos for Use of Airplane.

Mr. Sclavos receives reimbursement for business use
of his personal aircraft as more fully described in the “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” section elsewhere in this report.

In April 2007, the Company’s Internal Audit Department began a review of business expenses for which senior management was reimbursed by
the Company during calendar year 2006 and the first calendar quarter of 2007 and presented a preliminary report to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee concluded that the Company erroneously
reimbursed Mr. Sclavos in the amount of $32,190 for personal travel on his private plane. In June 2007, Mr. Sclavos reimbursed the Company for that amount.

The Internal Audit Department’s review of senior management business expenses has not yet been
completed.

Separation and Change-in-Control Payments and
Benefits.

The Company generally does not enter into employment agreements with its executive officers and employment offers generally do not provide for severance or other benefits following termination. However, we have
entered into severance arrangements with certain of our executive officers in the past. On February 16, 2007, we entered into a severance arrangement with Judy Lin, our former Executive Vice President and General Manager, Security Services, as
further described below. On October 31, 2006, we entered into a severance arrangement with Vernon Irvin, our former Executive Vice President and General Manager, Communications Services, as further described below. On July 9, 2007, we entered
into a consulting and separation agreement with Mr. Sclavos, our former CEO, President and Chairman of the Board, as further described below.



Upon certain changes in control, the option vesting schedule accelerates as to 50% of any shares subject
to stock options that are then unvested for officers at the level of senior vice president and above and as to 100% of any shares subject to stock options that are then unvested for the president and chief executive officer.

On July 9, 2007, VeriSign entered into a Consulting and Separation
Agreement with Mr. Sclavos in connection with his resignation on May 27, 2007. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Mr. Sclavos will provide consulting services to the Company for a one-year period at the rate of $5,000 per month
and is prohibited from engaging in certain competitive activities or soliciting customers of the Company during such period. The Company will pay Mr. Sclavos severance of $1,969,380 within twenty-one (21) days of the effective date of the
agreement and $1,969,380 on June 15, 2008, subject to his compliance with the terms of the agreement. In the event of a change-in-control of the Company, all severance payments will accelerate and become immediately due and payable.

The Company accelerated all of Mr. Sclavos’ outstanding options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and restricted stock
units that are scheduled to vest within twenty-four (24) months after Mr. Sclavos’ resignation. Accordingly, vesting for restricted stock units with respect to approximately 156,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and the
following stock options were accelerated:

On May 31, 2007,
in anticipation of entering into this agreement, the Company paid Mr. Sclavos severance in the amount of $1,031,580 and $115,422 for all unpaid wages and unused paid time off accrued through his resignation date.

The Company will also pay Mr. Sclavos $5,459,430 within twenty-one (21)
days of the effective date of the agreement in connection with an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock that was previously granted to Mr. Sclavos but was erroneously deleted from the Company’s records as
more fully described in the Explanatory Note appearing at the beginning of this report.

With respect to an option to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $10.08 that was previously granted to Mr. Sclavos, if the Board of Directors determines in good
faith that the exercise price of such option should be increased, then the exercise price of the unexercised portion of such option will be increased and with respect to the portion of such option that may have been exercised, Mr. Sclavos
agrees to repay the Company the difference between the increased exercise price and the original exercise price.

Severance Agreement with Ms. Lin

.    On February 16, 2007, VeriSign entered into a severance agreement with Judy Lin, the
former Executive Vice President and General Manager, Security Services (“Lin Severance Agreement”). In consideration of Ms. Lin’s service with VeriSign and in exchange for Ms. Lin’s release of claims and
covenant not to sue, VeriSign agreed to pay Ms. Lin a severance payment in the total amount of $571,200, $382,704 of which was paid in 2007, and the other $188,496 will be paid on the one year anniversary of the termination of her employment,
subject to Ms. Lin’s compliance with non-solicitation and non-competition provisions. In March 2007, VeriSign also paid Ms. Lin $214,200, representing her bonus for services performed for VeriSign in 2006. VeriSign also made payments
to Ms. Lin for her COBRA and life insurance premiums and provided certain administrative and other support as forth in the Lin Severance Agreement.



Upon termination of
Ms. Lin’s employment with VeriSign, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 19,719 of Ms. Lin’s then unvested stock options to purchase shares of VeriSign common stock for which the fair market value is greater than the exercise price of
her employment on the termination date. Also upon termination of Ms. Lin’s employment, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 4,250 of her then unvested restricted stock units of VeriSign common stock.

Severance Agreement with Mr. Irvin.

On
October 31, 2006, VeriSign entered into a Severance and General Release Agreement (the “Irvin Severance Agreement”) with Vernon L. Irvin, the former Executive Vice President and General Manager, Communications Services. In
consideration of Mr. Irvin’s service with VeriSign and in exchange for Mr. Irvin’s release of claims and covenant not to sue, VeriSign agreed to pay Mr. Irvin a severance payment in the total amount of $683,520, $457,958 of
which was paid in 2006, and the other $225,562 will be paid on the one year anniversary of the termination of his employment, subject to Mr. Irvin’s compliance with non-solicitation and non-competition provisions. In March 2007, VeriSign
also paid Mr. Irvin $179,424, representing his bonus for services performed for VeriSign in 2006. VeriSign also made payments to Mr. Irvin for his COBRA and life insurance premiums and provided certain administrative and other support as
set forth in the Irvin Severance Agreement.

Upon termination
of Mr. Irvin’s employment with VeriSign, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 22,781 of Mr. Irvin’s then unvested stock options to purchase shares of VeriSign common stock for which the fair market value is greater than the
exercise price of his employment on the termination date. Also upon termination of Mr. Irvin’s employment, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 4,450 of his then unvested restricted stock units of VeriSign common stock.

Report of the Compensation Committee

The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be

incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the Exchange Act.

The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for 2006. Based on the review and
discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Compensation Committee
Interlocks and Insider Participation

All members of
the compensation committee during 2006 were independent directors, and none of them were employees or former employees of VeriSign. No executive officer of VeriSign has served on the compensation committee of the board of directors of any other
entity that has or has had one or more executive officers who served as a member of the Board of Directors or the compensation committee of VeriSign during the 2006 fiscal year. Mr. Sclavos, the former President, Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of the Board of Directors of VeriSign, served on the board of directors of Juniper Networks during the 2006 fiscal year. Mr. Kriens, a member of the Board of Directors of VeriSign, is Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board
of directors of Juniper Networks.

ITEM 13.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS

In May 2007, VeriSign’s Audit Committee approved a

Policy for
Entering into Transactions with Related Persons

(the “Policy”) which sets forth the requirements for review, approval or ratification of transactions between VeriSign and “related persons,” as such term is defined under
Item 404 of Regulation S-K.

Pursuant to the terms of the
Policy, the Audit Committee shall review, approve or ratify the terms of any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which
(i) VeriSign was or is to be a participant and (ii) a related person has or will have a direct or indirect interest,

except

transactions entered into at arms length and in the ordinary course of business where the aggregate value of
the transaction is less than $120,000 (“Related Party Transaction”). In determining whether to approve or ratify a Related Party Transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the
Related Party Transaction terms are no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the materiality of the related person’s direct or indirect interest in the
transaction.

Prior approval of the Audit Committee shall be
required for the following Related Party Transactions:

•

Any Related Party Transaction where a related person enters into an agreement or arrangement directly with VeriSign;

provided, however

, certain agreements or
arrangements between VeriSign and a related person concerning employment and any compensation solely resulting from the employment or concerning compensation as a member of the Board of Directors that have, in each case, been entered into or
approved in accordance with policies of VeriSign shall not be subject to prior approval of the Audit Committee.

•

Any Related Party Transaction involving an indirect material interest of a related person where the terms of the agreement or arrangement are not negotiated on an
arms length basis or where the Related Party Transaction is not a transaction in the ordinary course of business;

provided, further

, that the Audit Committee shall have the sole discretion in determining whether an indirect interest of a
related person is material.

•

Any Related Party Transaction where the total contract value exceeds $1 million.

On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee shall review and, if determined by the Audit Committee to be appropriate, ratify
any Related Party Transaction not requiring prior approval of the Audit Committee pursuant to the Policy.

In the event VeriSign proposes to enter into a transaction with a related person who is a member of the Audit Committee or an immediate family member of a
member of the Audit Committee, prior approval by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors shall be required and no such member of the Audit Committee for which he or she or an immediate family member is a related person
shall participate in any discussion or approval of such transaction, except to provide all material information concerning the Related Party Transaction.

The following Related Party Transactions shall be deemed to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee, even if the aggregate amount involved exceeds
$120,000:

•

Payment of compensation to officers in connection with their employment with VeriSign;

provided

that, such compensation has been approved in accordance with
policies of VeriSign.

•

Remuneration to directors in connection with their service as a member of the Board of Directors;

provided

that, such remuneration has been approved in
accordance with policies of VeriSign.



•

Reimbursement of expenses incurred in exercising duties as an officer or director of VeriSign provided such reimbursement has been approved in accordance with
policies of VeriSign.

•

Any transaction with another company at which a related person’s only relationship is an employee (other than an executive officer), director or beneficial
owner of less than 10% of that company’s shares, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed $1,000,000.

•

Any transaction with a related person involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, or similar
services.

•

Any transaction involving a related person where the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive bids.

•

Any transaction where the related person’s interest arises solely from the ownership of VeriSign’ common stock and all holders of VeriSign’s common
stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis (e.g., dividends).

There are no transactions required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K where the Policy did not require review, approval or ratification, or where the Policy was not followed because the Policy was
not adopted until May 2007.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

Since January 1, 2006, there has not been, nor is
there currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we or any of our subsidiaries was or is to be a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in which any director, executive officer or
beneficial holder of more than 5% of the common stock of VeriSign or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest other than the transactions described below.

Reimbursement Payments to Mr. Sclavos for Use of
Airplane.

The compensation committee has approved a policy for the reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by Stratton D. Sclavos in the operation of his private plane when used for VeriSign business. Under this policy,
we will reimburse Mr. Sclavos $2,900 per flight hour up to $650,000 per year. During 2006, we reimbursed approximately $568,400 under this policy. All amounts reimbursed to Mr. Sclavos were approved by the compensation committee of the
Board of Directors. Mr. Sclavos was President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors until his resignation on May 27, 2007.

In April 2007, the Company’s Internal Audit Department began a review of business expenses for which senior management was reimbursed by
the Company during calendar year 2006 and the first calendar quarter of 2007 and presented a preliminary report to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee concluded that the Company erroneously
reimbursed Mr. Sclavos in the amount of $32,190 for personal travel on his private plane. In June 2007, Mr. Sclavos reimbursed the Company for that amount.

The Internal Audit Department’s review of senior management business expenses has not yet been
completed.

On July 9, 2007, VeriSign entered into a Consulting
and Separation Agreement with Mr. Sclavos in connection with his resignation on May 27, 2007. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Mr. Sclavos will provide consulting services to the Company for a one-year period at the rate of $5,000 per month
and is prohibited from engaging in certain competitive activities or soliciting customers of the Company during such period. The Company will pay Mr. Sclavos severance of $1,969,380 within twenty-one (21) days of the effective date of the agreement
and $1,969,380 on June 15, 2008, subject to his compliance with the terms of the agreement. In the event of a change-in-control of the Company, all severance payments will accelerate and become immediately due and payable.



The Company accelerated all of Mr. Sclavos’ outstanding options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock and restricted stock units that are scheduled to vest within twenty-four (24) months after Mr. Sclavos’ resignation. Accordingly, vesting for restricted stock units with respect to approximately 156,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock and the following stock options were accelerated:

On May 31, 2007, in
anticipation of entering into this agreement, the Company paid Mr. Sclavos severance in the amount of $1,031,580 and $115,422 for all unpaid wages and unused paid time off accrued through his resignation date.

The Company will also pay Mr. Sclavos $5,459,430 within twenty-one (21) days
of the effective date of the agreement in connection with an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock that was previously granted to Mr. Sclavos but was erroneously deleted from the Company’s records as more fully
described in the Explanatory Note appearing at the beginning of this report.

With respect to an option to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $10.08 that was previously granted to Mr. Sclavos, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith
that the exercise price of such option should be increased, then the exercise price of the unexercised portion of such option will be increased and with respect to the portion of such option that may have been exercised, Mr. Sclavos agrees to repay
the Company the difference between the increased exercise price and the original exercise price.

Severance Arrangement with Ms. Lin.

On February 16, 2007, VeriSign entered into a severance Agreement with Judy
Lin, the former Executive Vice President and General Manager, Security Services (“Lin Severance Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay Ms. Lin a severance payment in the total amount of $571,200, of which
$382,704 was paid in 2007, and the balance is payable on the one year anniversary of the termination of her employment, subject to Ms. Lin’s compliance with non-solicitation and non-competition provisions. In March 2007, VeriSign also paid
Ms. Lin $214,200, representing her bonus for services performed for VeriSign in 2006. VeriSign also made payments to Ms. Lin for her COBRA and life insurance premiums and provided certain administrative and other support as forth in the
Lin Severance Agreement.

Upon termination of
Ms. Lin’s employment with VeriSign, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 19,719 of Ms. Lin’s then unvested stock options to purchase shares of VeriSign common stock for which the fair market value is greater than the exercise price of
her employment on the termination date. Also upon termination of Ms. Lin’s employment, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 4,250 of her then unvested restricted stock units of VeriSign common stock.

Severance Arrangement with Mr. Irvin.

On
October 31, 2006, VeriSign entered into a Severance and General Release Agreement (the “Irvin Agreement”) with Vernon L. Irvin, the former Executive Vice President and General Manager, Communications Services, pursuant to which the
Company agreed to pay Mr. Irvin a severance payment in the total amount of $683,520, of which $457,958 was paid in 2006 and the other $225,562 will be paid on the one year anniversary of the termination of his employment, subject to
Mr. Irvin’s compliance with non-solicitation and non-competition provisions. In March 2007, VeriSign also paid Mr. Irvin $179,424, representing his bonus for services performed for VeriSign in 2006. VeriSign also made payments to
Mr. Irvin for his COBRA and life insurance premiums and provided certain administrative and other support as set forth in the Irvin Agreement.



Upon termination of
Mr. Irvin’s employment with VeriSign, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 22,781 of Mr. Irvin’s then unvested stock options to purchase shares of VeriSign common stock for which the fair market value is greater than the exercise
price of his employment on the termination date. Also upon termination of Mr. Irvin’s employment, VeriSign accelerated vesting of 4,450 of his then unvested restricted stock units of VeriSign common stock.

Payments to Mr. Donovan

.    In 2007, John
Donovan received a bonus payment of $24,000 in connection with his service as Chief Executive Officer of inCode during 2006. In addition, in 2006, VeriSign paid Mr. Donovan $5,000,000 pursuant to the terms of an inCode Management Retention
Plan. Mr. Donovan’s offer of employment provides for reimbursement of relocation expenses up to $1,500,000 in connection with his relocation to California. In February 2007, we reimbursed Mr. Donovan $1,366,827 in connection with his
relocation. Mr. Donovan is our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Services.

Transactions with U.S. Bancorp

.    We have entered into agreements with U.S. Bancorp and its affiliates (collectively “U.S. Bank”) pursuant to which we provide various services to
U.S. Bank. William L. Chenevich is a member of our Board of Directors and the Vice Chairman of Technology and Operations for U.S. Bancorp. In 2006, the value of such transactions was $2,008,348, which was comprised mostly of professional consulting
services, and in 2007, the value of such transactions was approximately $1,174,131, which includes $752,893 for professional consulting services and $421,238 for security services. We have also entered into agreements pursuant to which we purchase
various products and services from U.S. Bank; however, the amounts are not material. In addition, U.S. Bank is a lender under a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), under which VeriSign, or certain
designated subsidiaries may be borrowers. The Facility is more fully described in Note 10 “Credit Facility” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The portion
of interest and fees paid by us under the Facility that was attributable to U.S. Bank was $299,100 in 2006 and $113,800 in 2007.

the circumstances and to the extent provided for in the agreements, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements he or she may be required to pay in actions or proceedings which he or she is or may be made a party to by reason of his or
her position as a director, officer or other agent of VeriSign, and otherwise to the full extent permitted under Delaware law and our bylaws.

Acceleration of Equity Award Vesting in the Event of a Change-in-Control.

Options generally vest at the rate of 25% of the
shares subject to the option on the first anniversary of the date of the grant and thereafter with respect to 6.25% each quarter. However, upon certain changes in control, the vesting schedule accelerates as to 50% of any shares subject to stock
options that are then unvested for officers at the level of senior vice president



and above and as to 100% of any shares subject to stock options that are then unvested for the president and chief executive officer. In addition, upon a
change-in-control, the vesting schedule for equity awards accelerates as to 100% of any shares that are then unvested for all non-employee directors.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As required under Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the consolidated financial statements of VeriSign are provided in this
separate section. The consolidated financial statements included in this section are as follows:



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

VeriSign, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item
9A.b), that VeriSign, Inc. (the Company) did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, because of the effect of a material weakness identified in management’s assessment, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

The Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 arising from a combination of the following control deficiencies in the Company’s stock
administration policies and practices: (1) failure to consistently implement and apply policies and procedures related to the approval of equity-based grants to executive officers, retention grants and grants made in connection with new hires,
promotions, and annual performance reviews; (2) lack of complete and timely reconciliation of grants and cancellations from the Company’s stock administration database to its financial reporting systems; lack of consistent reconciliation
of grant dates in the system of record to supporting documentation; (3) inadequate supervision and training of personnel involved with the equity-based grant processes; and (4) lack of effective coordination and communication among the
Human Resources Department, Accounting Department and Legal



Department in connection with the administration of equity-based grants. The control deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected. A material weakness comprised of similar control deficiencies to those noted above resulted in material errors to, and the restatement of,
the 2005 and 2004 annual consolidated financial statements and the condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods in 2005 and for the interim period ended March 31, 2006.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that VeriSign, Inc. did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, VeriSign, Inc. has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

The Company acquired m-Qube, Inc. (m-Qube) and inCode Telecom
Group, Inc. (inCode) on May 1, 2006 and November 30, 2006, respectively, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 m-Qube’s and
inCode’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $316,131,000 and $89,656,000, respectively, and total revenues of $26,985,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, included in the consolidated financial statements of
VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of VeriSign, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of m-Qube and
inCode.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. The aforementioned material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
2006 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated July 12, 2007, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

VeriSign, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note
2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2005 have been restated.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financials statements, effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting of VeriSign, Inc. as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and
our report dated July 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

Note 1.    Description

of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

VeriSign, Inc. (“VeriSign” or “the Company”), a Delaware corporation, operates intelligent infrastructure services that enable and
protect billions of interactions every day across the world’s voice and data networks. We offer a variety of Internet and communications-related services which are marketed through Web site sales, direct field sales, channel sales, telesales,
and member organizations in our global affiliate network.

VeriSign is organized into two reportable service-based segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. The Internet Services Group consisted of the Security Services business and the Information Services
business. The Security Services business provided products and services that protect online and network interactions, enabling companies to manage reputational, operational and compliance risks. The Information Services business was the
authoritative directory provider of all .

domain names, and also provided other value added services, including intelligent supply chain services, real-time publisher services and digital brand
management services. The Communications Services Group provided communications services, such as connectivity and interoperability services and intelligent database services; commerce services, such as billing and operational support system services
(“OSS”), mobile commerce, self care and analytics services; and content services, such as digital content and messaging services.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VeriSign and its subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts
and transactions. As of December 31, 2006, VeriSign owned approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of its consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. The minority interest’s proportionate share of income is included in
minority interest in the consolidated statement of income. Changes in VeriSign’s proportionate share of the net assets of VeriSign Japan K.K. resulting from sales of capital stock by the subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions.
VeriSign accounted for the November 2005 sale of its payment gateway business as a discontinued operation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144 (“SFAS 144”),

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets”

. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect its payment
gateway business as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements pertain to continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

The discussion and analysis of VeriSign’s financial position and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, restructuring,
stock-based compensation, royalty liabilities, and deferred taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

Cash and Cash Equivalents

VeriSign considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition
to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, commercial paper and various deposit accounts.

Short-Term Investments

Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months are considered short-term investments. VeriSign invests in debt and
equity securities of companies for business and investment purposes.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair
value of VeriSign’s cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, restricted cash and investments, accounts payable, short-term debt and other long-term liabilities approximates the carrying amount, which is the amount for
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. See Note 7, “Cash, Cash Equivalents, Investments and Restricted Cash” for further information regarding these instruments.

Long-Term Investments

Investments in non-public companies where VeriSign owns less than 20% of the
voting stock and has no indicators of significant influence are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for under the cost method. For these non-quoted investments, VeriSign regularly reviews the assumptions
underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information provided by these privately held companies. This information may be more limited, may not be as timely, and may be less accurate than information available from
publicly traded companies. Assessing each investment’s carrying value requires significant judgment by management. Generally, if cash balances are insufficient to sustain the investee’s operations for a six-month period and there are no
anticipated prospects of future funding for the investee, VeriSign considers the decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary. If it is determined that an other-than-temporary decline exists in a non-public equity security, VeriSign writes down
the investment to its fair value and records the related impairment as an investment loss in its consolidated statement of income. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, VeriSign determined that the decline in value of certain of its non-public equity
investments was other-than-temporary and recorded impairments of these investments totaling $0.4 million, $0.8 million, and $12.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, long-term investments totaling $11.2 million and $6.7
million have been included in other assets on the respective consolidated balance sheets.

Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not include finance charges. VeriSign maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. VeriSign regularly reviews the adequacy of its accounts receivable allowance after considering the significance of the accounts receivable
balance, each customer’s expected ability to pay and its collection history with each customer. VeriSign reviews significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors
described above. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, VeriSign maintains general reserve provisions based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these reserves, VeriSign analyzes its historical collection experience and current
economic trends. If the historical data VeriSign uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future
results of operations could be materially affected.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 40 years for buildings and three to five years for computer equipment, purchased software, office equipment, and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease terms.

Capitalized Software

Costs incurred in connection with the development of software products are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 86, “

Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.

” Development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products, and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established. VeriSign’s software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility, and accordingly no such costs have been
capitalized.

Software included in property and equipment
includes amounts paid for purchased software and implementation services for software used internally that has been capitalized in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”)
No. 98-1, “

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

”. The following table summarizes the capitalized costs related to third-party implementation and consulting services as well as
costs related to internally developed software:

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of costs
over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least
annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset

” (SFAS 142). As of December 31, 2006, there were no other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. SFAS 142
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS 144, long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to
amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the
fair value of the underlying business, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business, difficulties or delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of an acquired business. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an
asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Purchased goodwill is not amortized but is subject to testing for impairment on at least an annual basis. VeriSign performed
its annual impairment tests as of June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The fair value of VeriSign’s reporting units is determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof. Under the income approach, the
fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis
that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. In the application of the income and market valuation approaches, VeriSign is required to make estimates of future operating trends
and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates.

There were no impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment tests conducted as of June 30, 2006, 2005 and
2004.

Provision for Royalty Liabilities for Intellectual
Property Rights

Certain of VeriSign content services
utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others. Where VeriSign has not yet entered into a license agreement with a holder, VeriSign records a provision for royalty payments that it estimates will be due once a license agreement
is concluded. VeriSign estimates the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized. VeriSign’s estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any
definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property, such as a change in demand for a particular type of content, in which case VeriSign would record a royalty expense materially different
than its estimate.

Foreign Currency Translation

VeriSign conducts business throughout the world and
transacts in multiple currencies. The functional currency for most of VeriSign’s international subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are remeasured into U.S. Dollars using a combination of current and
historical exchange rates and any remeasurement gains and losses are included in operating results.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using the current
rate for assets and liabilities and a weighted-average rate for the period for revenues and expenses. This translation results in a cumulative translation adjustment that is included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which is a
separate component of stockholders’ equity.

VeriSign
maintains a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of its operations that are denominated in non-functional currencies. The primary objective of this
program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor does it hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner
that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The program may entail the use of forward or option contracts, and in each case, these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

At December 31, 2006, VeriSign held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately
$182.4 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. All forward contracts were recorded at fair market value on the balance sheet and gains and losses were included in earnings. The Company
attempts to limit its exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high-quality financial institutions.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified
as available-for-sale. The following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2006 and 2005:

Revenue Recognition

VeriSign derives its revenues from two reportable
segments: (i) the Internet Services Group, which consists of Security Services and Information Services; and (ii) the Communications Services Group, which consists of Network Connectivity and Interoperability Services, Intelligent Database
Services, Content and Application Services, Clearing and Settlement Services, and Billing and Payment Services. Unless otherwise noted below, VeriSign’s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “

Revenue Recognition,

” and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 00-21, “

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.

”

The revenue recognition policy for
each of these categories is as follows:

Internet Services Group

Security Services

Revenues from the Security Services business are comprised of security
services including managed security services and authentication services for enterprises.

Managed Security Services (“MSS”).

Revenues from managed security services primarily consist of a set-up fee and a monthly service fee for the managed security service. Revenues
from set-up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned and revenues from the monthly service fees are recognized in the period in which the services are provided.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

VeriSign also provides global security consulting services to help enterprises assess, design, and
deploy network security solutions. Revenues from global security consulting services are recognized either on a time-and-materials basis as the services are performed, or for fixed price consulting as services are performed, completed and accepted.
In some cases fixed price consulting is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting. Proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. VeriSign has a
history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and
all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Revenues from time-and-materials are recognized as services are performed.

Authentication Services.

Revenues from the sale of authentication and security services primarily consist of a set-up fee,
annual managed service and per-seat license fee. Revenues from the fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license, generally 12 to 36 months. Post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is bundled with authentication and
security services licenses and recognized over the license term.

VeriSign Affiliate PKI Software and Services.

VeriSign Affiliate PKI Software and Services (“International Affiliates”) are for digital certificate technology and business process technology. Revenues
from the VeriSign Affiliate PKI Software and Services are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including PCS and other services. These software licenses, which do not provide for right of return, are primarily perpetual licenses for
which revenues are recognized up-front once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met.

VeriSign recognizes revenues from VeriSign Affiliate PKI Software and Services in accordance with SOP 97-2, “

Software Revenue
Recognition,

” as amended by SOP 98-9, “

Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Transactions

,” when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is probable. VeriSign defines each of these four criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.

It is the Company’s customary practice to have a written contract, which is signed
by both the customer and VeriSign, or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with VeriSign.

•

Delivery has occurred.

VeriSign’s software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer. Electronic
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon download by the customer from an FTP server. Where an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product, delivery is not considered to have
occurred until these products or services are delivered or accepted.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable.

It is VeriSign’s policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of their
paid license fees. Generally, at least 80% of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less, but VeriSign may agree to payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs. Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these
customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable, and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable.

•

Collectibility is probable.

Collectibility is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. VeriSign typically sells to customers for whom
there is a history of successful collection. New customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customer’s financial position and, ultimately, their ability to pay. If VeriSign determines from the outset of an arrangement
that collectibility is not probable based upon its credit review process, revenues are recognized as cash is collected.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

The Company’s determination of fair value of each element in multiple-element software
arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value. VeriSign limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately. VeriSign has analyzed all of the
elements included in its multiple-element software arrangements and determined that it has sufficient VSOE to allocate revenues to PCS and professional services components of its perpetual license arrangements. VeriSign sells its professional
services separately, and has established VSOE on this basis. VSOE for PCS is determined based upon the customer’s annual renewal rates for these elements. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenues from
perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9.

VeriSign’s consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software. The Company’s software products are fully
functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration. Customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of VeriSign’s technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being
performed, but customers may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services. Software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services, which are generally
billed on a time-and-materials or milestone-achieved basis.

VeriSign also receives ongoing royalties from each digital certificate or authentication service sold by the VeriSign Affiliate to an end user. The Company recognizes the royalties from affiliates over the term of the digital certification
or authentication service to which the royalty relates, which is generally 12 to 24 months.

SSL Certificate Services

.    Revenues from SSL Certificate services include the sale or renewal of digital certificates. These revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of
the digital certificate, which is generally 12 to 36 months.

Information Services

Naming
Services.

VeriSign’s Information Services revenues primarily include registry services for the

.com

and

.net

gTLDs and certain ccTLDs, and managed domain name services. Domain name registration revenues
consist primarily of registration fees charged to registrars for domain name registration services. Revenues from the initial registration or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration
term, generally one to two years and up to ten years. Fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences. These fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term,
ranging from one to ten years.

Digital Brand Management
Services.

Revenues from digital brand management services include VeriSign’s domain name registration services and its brand monitoring services. Revenues from the registration fees are deferred and recognized ratably
over the registration term and the revenues from the brand monitoring services are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided, which is generally one to ten years.

Communications Services Group

Revenues from Communications Services business are comprised of connectivity
and interoperability services, intelligent database services, content services, messaging services, clearing and settlement services, and billing and OSS services.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

Connectivity and Interoperability Services

Through VeriSign’s network connectivity and interoperability services,
VeriSign provides SS7 Connectivity and Signaling, and Voice and Data Roaming services.

SS7 Connectivity and Signaling

.    Network connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to VeriSign’s SS7 network and trunk signaling services.
Revenues from network connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees, along with trunk signaling service fees, which are charged and recognized monthly based on the number of switches to which a customer signals.

Voice and Data Roaming.

Voice and Data roaming
revenues are derived from enabling service providers to offer wireless data roaming to their subscribers. Revenues from wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue retained by VeriSign and
recognized in the period in which such calls are processed on a per-minute or per-call basis.

Intelligent Database Services

Intelligent Database Services revenues include Number Portability, Caller Name Identification, Toll-free Database Services and TeleBlock Do Not Call, which are derived primarily from monthly database administration
and database query services and are charged and recognized on a per-use or per-query basis.

Content and Application Services

Content services revenues are derived by providing digital content services, including Digital Content services, Messaging services and Mobile Delivery services. Revenues from content services primarily consist of
weekly, biweekly or monthly subscriber fees. VeriSign recorded these revenues net of the fees from its wireless carriers in accordance with EITF No. 99-19, “

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent

.”
VeriSign also provides content services on a transaction basis and recognizes revenue upon delivery. VeriSign’s content subscription plans allow for a specified number of content downloads per subscription period and give the customer the
ability to rollover unused content downloads to future periods. VeriSign considers historical customer usage patterns to estimate and defer revenue for the number of content downloads expected to be rolled over and utilized prior to termination of
the subscription plan.

Revenues from Messaging services are
derived by providing multimedia, global and short messaging services between carrier systems and devices, and across disparate networks and technologies so the carrier’s customers can exchange messages outside their carrier’s network.
Revenues from Messaging services primarily represent fees charged and recognized for the messaging services either based on a monthly fee or number of messages processed. VeriSign also provides consulting services to provide multimedia messaging and
interoperability solutions. These fees are charged on a transaction or fixed-fee basis. The revenues associated with interoperability solutions are typically recognized over the estimated useful life, which is generally one to two years.

Clearing and Settlement Services

The Communications Services Group also offers advanced billing and customer
care services to wireline and wireless carriers. VeriSign’s advanced billing and customer care services include:

Wireline and Wireless Clearinghouse Services

.    Clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from
serving as a distribution and collection point for billing information and payment collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another. Revenues from clearinghouse services



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

are earned based on the number of messages processed. Amounts due from customers that are related to VeriSign’s telecommunications services for
third-party network access, database charges and clearinghouse toll amounts that have been invoiced and remitted to the customer are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Billing and OSS Services

Revenues from Billing and OSS services primarily represent a monthly recurring fee for every subscriber activated by
VeriSign’s wireless carrier customers.

Advertising
Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and
are included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Advertising expense was $150.1 million in 2006, $287.7 million in 2005 and $87.9 million in 2004.

Income Taxes

VeriSign uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. VeriSign records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not.

Stock-Based Compensation

Prior to January 1, 2006, VeriSign accounted for stock-based awards
under the intrinsic value method, which followed the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”), “

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

”, and related
interpretations. The intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock awards at fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock, and
for stock options to the extent option exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant. To the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to
operating expenses.

Effective January 1, 2006, the
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

” (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R replaced SFAS No. 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

” (SFAS 123) and superseded APB 25. VeriSign
elected the modified prospective application method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and
are subsequently modified. For stock-based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, the Company will amortize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Estimated
compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost estimated for the SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures.

VeriSign recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $33.8 million during 2006 as a
result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 13, “Stock-Based Compensation” for further information regarding stock- based compensation assumptions and expenses. The FASB Staff Position No. 123R-3 (“FSP 123R-3”),
“

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

”, provides an elective method for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to
the adoption of SFAS 123R. FSP No. 123R-3 provides that an entity may make a one-time election to adopt the transition method. An entity may take up to one year from its initial adoption of SFAS 123R to make the
election. During the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, VeriSign elected the short-cut transition method described in FSP 123R-3, and analyzed its effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.
The election of the transition method did not have a material impact on VeriSign’s consolidated financial statements.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share on VeriSign’s consolidated statement of income if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation:

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject VeriSign to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. VeriSign maintains its cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities with high quality financial institutions and, as part of its cash management process,
performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. In addition, the portfolio of investments in marketable securities conforms to VeriSign’s policy regarding concentration of investments, maximum
maturity and quality of investment. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited by the diversity of the customer base and geographic dispersion. VeriSign also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally requires no collateral. VeriSign maintains an allowance for potential credit losses on its accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts:

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncement

In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets or Financial Liabilities

,” which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair
value. The objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure
requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning
after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of Statement
No. 157 “

Fair Value Measurements

” (SFAS 157). The Company is currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 159, and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which defines fair
value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior
accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal
year. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of SFAS No. 157, and the impact it will have on its financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”),

“Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”

, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be
considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

provides transition guidance for correcting errors and requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance-sheet and income-statement
approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative factors. In the year of adoption only, if the effect of prior periods uncorrected misstatement is determined to be
material, under SAB 108 a registrant is allowed to record the effect as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning-of-year retained earnings. SAB 108 does not change the requirements within SFAS No. 154, “

Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections”

for the correction of an error on financial statements. Further, SAB 108 does not change the Staff’s previous guidance in SAB No. 99, “

Materiality”

, on evaluating the materiality of misstatements. The
Company was required to adopt SAB 108 in its current fiscal year. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “

Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes

”. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also
provides guidance on the recognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods
and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. The differences between the amounts recognized in the financial statements prior to
the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of the Company’s accumulated deficit.

In June 2006, the FASB issued EITF 06-3, “

How Sales Taxes Collected
from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement”

. EITF 06-3 provides guidance on an entity’s disclosure of its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain
taxes and provides that if taxes included in gross revenues are significant, a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented (i.e., both interim and annual periods). Taxes within the
scope of EITF 06-3 are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company evaluated the effect of EITF
06-3, and does not believe that it will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations.

Note 2.    Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements

VeriSign is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

The Company is also restating the unaudited quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and the unaudited
condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The decision to restate was based on the results of an independent review into our stock option accounting that was conducted under the direction of an ad hoc group of
VeriSign’s independent directors who had not served on the Company’s Compensation Committee before 2005 (“Ad Hoc Group”), with the assistance of independent outside counsel, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP
(“Cleary Gottlieb”). In addition to Cleary Gottlieb, the Ad Hoc Group was assisted in its review by independent forensic accountants (collectively the “Review Team”). As part of the restatement, the Company has also made
adjustments to its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 to correct errors identified but which were not material to our financial statements for these fiscal years.

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected by the
restatements have not been amended and should not be relied upon.

On June 27, 2006, the Company announced that it had received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents relating to VeriSign’s stock option grants and practices dating
back to January 1, 1995, and had received an informal request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) related to VeriSign’s stock option grants and practices. On February 9, 2007, the Company
subsequently received a formal order of investigation from the SEC.

On November 21, 2006, VeriSign announced that the Ad Hoc Group had determined the need to restate VeriSign’s historical financial statements to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense
related to past stock option grants.

On March 30, 2007,
we requested guidance from the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC (the “OCA”) concerning certain accounting issues relating to the restatement of our historical financials and the Review. On June 25, 2007, the OCA and the
Company concluded their discussions regarding these accounting issues.

The Ad Hoc Group with the assistance of Cleary Gottleib reviewed the facts and circumstances of the timing of VeriSign’s historical stock option grants for the period from January 1998 through May 2006. The Company announced on
January 31, 2007 that the Ad Hoc Group’s Review was substantially completed and that, based on a review of the totality of evidence and the applicable law, the Review did not find intentional wrongdoing by any current member of the senior
management team or the former CEO. The Ad Hoc Group’s Review concluded that the Company failed to implement appropriate processes and controls for granting, accounting for, and reporting stock option grants and that corporate records in certain
circumstances were incomplete or inaccurate.

The Review Team
examined all grants to Section 16 officers and directors during the relevant period, as well as 7 annual performance grants to rank and file employees and 179 acquisition, new hire and promotion, and other grants to rank and file employees on
239 dates from January 1998 through January 2006.

The Review Team identified 8,164 stock option grants made on 41 dates during the relevant period for which measurement dates were incorrectly determined. The measurement dates required revision because the stated date either preceded or was
subsequent to the proper measurement date and the stock price on the stated date was generally lower than the price on the proper measurement date. In several instances, the Review Team also determined that the stock price assigned on the initial
grant dates was subsequently modified, without being given the required accounting and disclosure treatment.

As part of the restatement, the grants during the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was
finalized. The evidence related to each category of grant was analyzed including, but not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, and consistent with
the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, the controlling accounting standards were applied to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned
grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related income tax effects.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

Measurement Date Hierarchy

The Company has adopted the following framework for determining the measurement dates of its stock option grants and has
applied this framework to each grant based on the facts, circumstances and availability of documentation.

•

The Company reviewed the date of the minutes of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee meetings for grants made at such meetings when the number of
options and exercise price for each recipient had been clearly approved. Where the Review Team determined that the meeting date was not the measurement date, the Review Team determined the actual date of approval of the grant via other documentary
evidence and interviews.

•

When a grant was approved by unanimous written consent (“UWC”), the measurement date was the date of the Compensation Committee’s approval of the UWC
as established by available evidence, such as receipt of signature pages of the UWC, contemporaneous telephone and/or e-mail communications.

•

If a grant was approved by the CEO under authority delegated by the Compensation Committee, the measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval
to the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price.

•

If a grant was approved by the CEO based on the mistaken belief that he had delegated authority to do so (de facto or “substantive” authority), the
measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price.

•

In the event the date on which the CEO communicated approval was not evident from the approval forms, the measurement date was the date on which other available
evidence, such as the surrounding e-mail communications, established the date the CEO approved the grant.

•

In the event the date of CEO approval could not be established by reviewing other available evidence, such as e-mails, the measurement date was the date on which
the number of options and exercise price were entered into the Company’s option tracking database (Equity Edge).

•

Except for grants to Section 16 officers which require Compensation Committee approval, for new hire grants and promotion grants, prior to March 13, 1998,
the measurement date was the date the Compensation Committee approved the grant (as described above). For new hire grants and promotion grants after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and after September 30, 2002, the measurement
date was the 15th day or the last day of the month (or the prior business day if that day was not a business day) following the actual and documented start date or promotion date of the respective employee receiving the grant. New hire grants and
promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval. For new hire grants and promotion grants in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002, the measurement date was
the date on which the CEO communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price. If that date could not be
determined, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge.

After determining the measurement date through the steps in the above Measurement Date Hierarchy, the Company then determined if there were any changes to the individual
recipients, exercise prices or amount of shares granted after such measurement date. If there were no changes following such measurement date, then that



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

date would be used. If the Company identified changes following such measurement date, then the Company would evaluate whether the changes should delay the
measurement date for the entire list of grants on that date, result in a repricing, or result in separate accounting for specific grants.

Director Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    Grants to directors under the 1998 Director Plan (the “Director Plan”) were automatic
and non-discretionary; the Director Plan did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee to review or approve director grants. Each new director received an initial grant of a specified number of options on the date of his or her
appointment and annually on the anniversary of the initial grant to be priced on the appointment or anniversary date, respectively. Directors serving before the Director Plan was adopted received an annual grant on the anniversary of their previous
grant.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement
Dates

:    For the initial grant, the measurement date was the date the director was appointed to the Board, as reflected in Board minutes. In the absence of Board minutes, the measurement date was the date specified in the
proxy statement or, if not clear, the date of the first Board meeting attended by the new director. For anniversary grants, the measurement date was the annual anniversary of the initial grant (or the next business day if such date was not a
business day).

Executive Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation
Committee is required to approve all grants to executive officers. For grants to the former CEO, the Review Team concluded that, in all but three cases (including the February 2002 grant described below), the Compensation Committee or the Board of
Directors approved the grant on the stated grant date, resulting in a correct measurement date.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    For grants other than the February/May 2002 grant described below,
including the other two grants to the former CEO referred to above, please refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Acquisition Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    CEO authorization required. The Board of Directors implicitly delegated to the CEO authority to
approve grants to employees from acquisitions when the Board approved an acquisition.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

Annual Refresh Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation Committee was required to approve all annual refresh grants through and
including the 2004 annual refresh grant. In 2005, the Compensation Committee delegated to the CEO the authority to approve rank and file annual refresh grants.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

Extended Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors is required to
approve all extensions of grants.

Method for Determining
Proper Measurement Dates

:    Extended grants are a modification of a previous award. Available documentation was used to establish the modification date and to measure the additional compensation charge.

Retention and Off-Cycle Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    The Compensation
Committee is required to approve all retention and off-cycle grants.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates

:    Refer to the Documentation Hierarchy above. For the February/May 2002 retention grant described below, the former CEO approved the grants to rank and file
employees.

New Hire and Promotion Grants

Required Granting Actions

:    New hire grants and
promotion grants made after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and those made after September 30, 2002 were automatic and did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee review or approval. Prior to March 13,
1998, the Compensation Committee was required to approve all new hire and promotion grants. New hire grants and promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval.

Method for Determining Proper Measurement
Dates

:    Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above.

The 8,164 grants previously identified as having incorrectly determined measurement dates were classified into the following six categories: (1) 27 grants on 11 dates to persons elected or appointed as
members of the Board of Directors (“Director Grants”); (2) 33 grants to executive officers (“Executive Grants”); (3) 2,908 grants to employees issued after an acquisition, newly hired employees and promoted employees
under the new hire and promotion grants program described below (“New Hire and Promotion Grants Program”), and other grants to a large number of non-executives; (4) 4,226 grants made in broad-based awards to large numbers of
employees, usually on an annual basis (“Annual Refresh Grants”); (5) 964 off-cycle performance grants; and (6) 6 grants whereby the expiration dates were extended (“Extended Grants”). All references to the number of
option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices have been adjusted for all subsequent stock splits.

As discussed below, it was determined that the originally assigned grant dates for 8,164 grants were not ascribed the proper measurement dates for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures, stock-based compensation expense of $171.4 million on a pre-tax basis was recognized over the respective awards’ vesting terms for the periods from 1998 to 2006. The
adjustments made to reflect the proper measurement dates for accounting purposes were determined by category as follows:

Director Grants

:    64 director grants were made on 36 dates during the relevant period. Of the 64 grants, there were 27 grants
to directors for which it was determined that the originally determined grant dates preceded or succeeded the measurement dates, 11 grants were in excess of plan parameters, and some of the dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous
share price. Of the 27 grants with measurement date issues, 26 of



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

the grants involved periods of 5 days or less and resulted in a stock-based compensation expense of less than $100,000 in the aggregate. Revisions to
measurement dates for director grants were made where the wrong date was selected based on the requirements of the Director Plan and where incorrect start dates were used for the date the director joined the Board of Directors. The excess grants
have been historically honored by the Company. As a result, $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

Executive Officer Grants

:    It was determined that for 33 of the grants to executive officers, the originally determined grant
dates preceded the measurement dates or the grant dates and exercise prices were subsequently changed. Some of these dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. As the stock prices on the originally determined grant dates
were lower than the stock prices on the proper measurement date, $28.1 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized. The revised measurement dates for various executive officer grants were based on Compensation Committee meeting dates,
signed UWCs, delayed CEO approval, and for one date the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. The authority for 21 grants, which have been historically honored by the
Company, is based on the CEO’s presumed authority.

New
Hire and Promotion Grants Program

:    The Company concluded that the new hire and promotion grants made pursuant to the New Hire and Promotion Grants Program within the pre-established guidelines did not require an
adjustment, with the exception of the grants made from September 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002. For the 1,728 grants made during that time period, management concluded that the measurement dates occurred only on the dates of the CEO
approval. Due to practical difficulties in ascertaining the actual dates of the CEO approval for many new hire and promotion grants in that time period, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price
were entered into Equity Edge. The incremental stock-based compensation expense associated with the New Hire and Promotion Grants during the relevant period was $11.9 million.

Acquisition Grants

:    After the consummation of certain acquisitions, the Company granted stock
options to employees of the acquired entities. It was determined that the measurement dates for 1,180 option grants required revision because the stated grant dates preceded the proper measurement dates and the approval authority was based on CEO
approval. Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. Of the 1,180 grants, 1,048 grants were extinguished as part of the Company’s exchange program which commenced in November 2002. Due to issues
associated with the measurement dates for the acquisition grants, $36.2 million of additional stock-based compensation expense was recognized during the relevant period.

Annual Refresh Grants

:    During the relevant period, 3,782 broad-based grants were made to
employees under an annual program (the “Refresh Grants”) for which the originally assigned grant dates were not the proper measurement dates. Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, and the
authority for some of the Refresh Grants was the CEO’s presumed authority. For one of the annual Refresh Grants which occurred in August 2000, there was conflicting documentation and inconclusive evidence with respect to the measurement
date. It was determined that the most appropriate measurement date, due to the lack of affirmative evidence otherwise, was the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge, and based on that date, $19.2
million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the period 2000 to 2002. These grants were extinguished in December 2002 as part of the Company’s exchange program which commenced in November 2002. The Company did not approve
or process any stock option grants to existing employees during the period of the tender offer or agree or imply that it would compensate employees for any increases in the market price during the tender period. The Review also determined that
the annual refresh grants for the years 1999, 2001, 2004, and a portion of the 2003 grant had a measurement date that was



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

later than the date that was originally used. In these cases, where the measurement dates were revised, the authority for the grants varied and included new
dates based on UWCs by the Compensation Committee or approvals by the CEO. Where approval was not determinable based on the above, the Company utilized the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. Due to
the errors in measurement dates associated with the annual refresh grants, stock-based compensation expense of $55.1 million was recognized.

Off-Cycle Performance Grants

:    There were 964 performance grants made to employees on March 15, 2001 and October 1,
2003. These dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, and the authority for these grants was the CEO’s de facto authority. The revised measurement dates were based on the dates of the UWC for the March 15, 2001
grant and e-mail correspondence for the October 1, 2003 grant. Due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the off-cycle performance grants, stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million was recognized.

Extended Grants

:    During the relevant period,
there were 6 stock option extensions (including one to the former CEO described below) whereby an option was extended beyond its expiration or termination date and for which a compensation charge had not been recorded. As a result, $2.1 million of
stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

The former
CEO received certain options from Network Solutions, Inc. (“NSI”) in his capacity as a NSI director prior to VeriSign’s acquisition of NSI. Upon receiving legal advice, management extended the term of those options beyond their
original expiration date. The former CEO exercised those options on May 24, 2002. The Ad Hoc Group reviewed the extension of these options and determined that the legal advice was incorrect and that the options should not have been extended.
Upon learning of this determination in January 2007, the former CEO voluntarily paid $174,425 to VeriSign, reflecting the after-tax net profit he received from the exercise of those options.

2002 Retention Grants

:    Between
February and May 2002, the Compensation Committee considered special option grants as a retention incentive for executive officers and other executives and key employees, since in many cases the exercise prices of options previously granted to
these individuals were significantly above the then-current market price for shares of VeriSign’s common stock. These retention grants are summarized as follows:

Grants to Executive Officers and Other Executives

:    The Company determined that 68 grants of
options for a total of 4,631,000 shares to executive officers and other executives were finalized on April 10, 2002 rather than the stated grant date of February 21, 2002. The Review Team was unable, after review of detailed documentation,
including multiple draft versions of the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee minutes, approval forms (which were undated) and email correspondence, to affirmatively determine when the grants to executive officers and other executives were
approved. In accordance with the Company’s measurement date hierarchy for grants described above, the Company determined that April 10, 2002 was the correct measurement date because that was the date that other grants, including certain
executive grants, were entered into Equity Edge. The grant price as of the measurement date was $23.74, the closing market price of the Company’s stock on April 10, 2002. Because the stated exercise price of the grants was set based on the
closing market price on February 21, 2002 of $22.71 and preceded the measurement date, an incremental $1.3 million of stock-based compensation expense was recognized.

The Company also determined that the Compensation Committee repriced 1,870,000 of these options on May 24, 2002, with
an exercise price of $10.08, the closing market price of the Company’s stock on May 24,



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

2002. The Company determined that these grants were repriced based on a UWC of the Compensation Committee. The accounting impact of the repricing was not
recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and the Company did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. In accordance with FIN 44 and after applying variable accounting, the Company recognized incremental stock-based
compensation expense of approximately $15.8 million, net of reversals, for the periods between 2002 and 2006.

Grants to Employees

:    Broad-based employee grants were also considered during the February to May 2002 period. The
Review Team determined that the CEO, under his presumed authority, approved 305 broad-based employee grants on or about March 20, 2002 with a grant price of $26.42, the closing market price of the Company’s stock on that date. These awards
were communicated shortly thereafter to the employees. The Company determined that March 20, 2002 was a definitive measurement date for the awards to the employees.

The grants to employees previously approved by the CEO on March 20, 2002 were submitted for approval to the
Compensation Committee as evidenced in a UWC dated May 24, 2002. The Compensation Committee approved the 305 employee grants with an exercise price of $10.08, the market value of the Company’s common stock on May 24, 2002. Therefore
the employee awards were re-priced on that date. Although the awards had been communicated to the employees and disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2002, the accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the
time of the Compensation Committee approval and the Company did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing, and after applying variable accounting, approximately $6.6 million, net of reversals of additional
stock-based compensation expense, has been recorded for the periods between 2002 and 2006.

Retention Grants to our former CEO

:    In the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee meeting, the Committee considered the number and vesting period of a proposed option award to the
CEO. The Review Team found multiple draft versions of the minutes for the February 12, 2002 meeting of the Compensation Committee and concluded that the signed minutes were inaccurate. Attendees at the meeting have different recollections of
the business conducted. One draft, unapproved version of those minutes, stated the number of options to be awarded to the CEO was 1,200,000, while the signed version of the minutes approved by the members of the Compensation Committee in late
May 2002 stated that the number of options to be awarded was 600,000. Both versions of the minutes stated that the grant date and the exercise price was February 21, 2002 and $22.71. The minutes of a Board meeting held on February 12,
2002, after the Compensation Committee meeting, also indicate that the CEO was awarded 1,200,000 options at the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee meeting.

The Company has determined that the measurement date for the 1,200,000 options to the CEO was February 12, 2002 with a
grant price of $26.31, the closing market price of the Company’s stock on that date, and that the options were repriced on February 21, 2002 with a grant price of $22.71, the closing market price of the Company’s stock on that date.
Subsequently, 600,000 options of the 1,200,000 options were repriced on May 24, 2002 with a grant price of $10.08, the closing market price of the Company’s stock on that date. The accounting impact of the repricings was not recorded at
the time of the Compensation Committee approval and the Company did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing, and after applying variable accounting, approximately $7.5 million, net of reversals, of
additional stock-based compensation expense has been recorded for the periods between 2002 and 2006.

Actions Taken by the Board with respect to Grants

:    As part of the Review, the Board of Directors confirmed all option grants
(including those to our former CEO and CFO) that the Review Team concluded had authority issues as legally binding and enforceable obligations of the Company as of the date of such grant. In addition, the Board of Directors has decided to modify the
following grants to the former CEO and CFO in 2007 and no reversal of compensation expense was recorded for these negative modifications in the financial statements.

Former CEO

:    The February 2002 option grant to the former CEO of 600,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an
exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $26.31.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to the CFO of 25,000 shares originally dated December 29, 2000 at an exercise price of $74.188 was modified to a new exercise price of $127.31.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to
the CFO of 125,000 shares originally dated August 1, 2000 at an exercise price of $151.25 was modified to a new exercise price of $165.22.

Former CFO

:    An option grant to the CFO of 40,000 shares originally dated March 15, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.438
was modified to a new exercise price of $42.26. The CFO’s 409A tax election described below modified 1,667 of these options and the Board of Directors determined to modify the remaining 38,333 options.

Former CFO

:    A grant to the CFO of 90,000 shares
originally dated September 6, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.16 was modified to a new exercise price of $38.30. The CFO’s 409A tax election described below modified 11,250 of these options and the Board of Directors determined to modify
the remaining 78,750 options.

Former
CFO

:    The February 2002 option grant to the CFO of 100,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $23.74.

Other

:    The Company and the Review Team also
determined that the former CEO received an option grant in October 1998 for 100,000 shares (95,928 non-qualified stock options (“NQSOs”) and 4,072 incentive stock options (“ISOs”)), which split to options for 200,000 shares
in May 1999 and then split again to options for 400,000 shares in November 1999 when the Company announced a stock split during those respective periods. The account statements and monthly reporting statements for November 1 and
December 1, 2000 showed that the former CEO held options for 400,000 shares at the split-adjusted price of $7.67. However, the Ad Hoc Group determined that sometime between December 1, 2000 and January 1, 2001, the Company erroneously
changed the former CEO’s options to reflect the pre-split amount of 100,000 shares instead of 400,000 shares, but at the post-split price of $7.67. The error was never subsequently corrected. Therefore, the former CEO did not receive the
benefit of the additional 300,000 options arising from the two stock splits, which expired in 2005. Based on a determination by the Board of Directors after the Ad Hoc Group’s Review in May 2007, the Company has agreed to pay the former CEO
$5,459,430, reflecting the gain he would have realized from the exercise of these options prior to their expiration, based on the weighted-average price of stock options exercised by the former CEO in August 2005.

The other principal factual findings of the Review’s report included the
following:

•

The human resources, accounting, and legal departments failed to implement appropriate processes and controls. During 2000 through 2003, the option grant process
was characterized by a high degree of informality and relatively little oversight.

•

The Review found no evidence that accounting personnel were aware of the deficient practices used in selecting grant dates.

•

The Review found instances of incomplete and inaccurate corporate records, including two sets of Committee minutes that were inaccurate.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

•

The Review found no evidence of fictitious individuals being granted options.

•

Options found to be misdated, have a date chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, repriced, or unauthorized with a stated exercise price lower
than the share price at the actual approval date will result in adverse tax consequences to the recipients and the Company.

•

In light of the Review’s other findings, the Company’s disclosures related to option grants were inaccurate in some respects.

Based on the results of the Review, the
Company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense (benefit) net of related income tax effects related to past stock option grants of $1.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, ($21.6 million) and
$36.9 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. These adjustments were recorded based on the evidence and findings from the Ad Hoc Group’s review, including analysis of the measurement dates for the 8,164 stock option grants
made on 41 dates during the relevant period that the Review determined were incorrect.

The incremental impact from recognizing stock-based compensation expense resulting from the Ad Hoc Group’s Review of past stock option grants is as follows (in thousands):

(1)

Pre-tax expense adjustments are through March 31, 2006 and represents amounts being reported pursuant to FAS 123R whereas amounts for all other years represent amounts being
reported pursuant to APB 25.

(2)

Includes $0.8 million of other stock-based compensation adjustments that were unrelated to past stock option grants.

Additionally, the pro forma expense under SFAS 123 in Note 1 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K has been restated to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

Tax Implications

VeriSign evaluated the impact of the restatements on its global tax
provision and has determined that a portion of the tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation expense formerly associated with stock option deductions is attributable to continuing operations. VeriSign identified deferred tax assets totaling
$16.3 million at December 31, 2005 which reflect the benefit of tax deductions from future employee stock option exercises.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

VeriSign has not realized this or any other deferred tax asset relating to taxing jurisdictions within the United States as of December 31, 2005. See
Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding VeriSign’s realization of United States-based deferred tax assets.

VeriSign also believes that it should not have taken a tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m) in prior years for stock option
related amounts pertaining to certain executives. Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. As a result, VeriSign’s tax net operating losses associated with the stock option intra-period
allocation have decreased by $12.6 million. VeriSign continues to apply a valuation allowance to its tax net operating losses relating to stock options exercised prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

”. Pursuant to
Footnote 82 of SFAS 123R, VeriSign recognizes financial statement benefit of these tax net operating losses when such losses reduce cash taxes paid.

Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 409A”) imposes significant penalties on individual income taxpayers who were granted
stock options that were unvested as of December 31, 2004 and that have an exercise price of less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant (“Affected Options”). These tax consequences include income tax at vesting,
an additional 20% tax and interest charges. In addition, the issuer of Affected Options must comply with certain reporting and withholding obligations under Section 409A.

These adverse tax consequences may be avoided for unexercised Affected Options if the exercise price of the Affected Option
is adjusted to reflect the fair market value at the time the option was granted (as such measurement date is determined for financial reporting purposes). Under Treasury regulations, Affected Options held by an executive officer or directors of
VeriSign had to be amended on or before December 31, 2006 to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A; holders of Affected Options who are not executive officers or directors of VeriSign have until December 31, 2007 to amend
their Affected Options to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A.

Other Matters

As part
of the restatement, the Company made other adjustments to previously issued financial statements back to 2002. These adjustments include corrections to revenue, expenses, other income and related tax adjustments. The expenses mentioned below are in
addition to the recognition of additional stock compensation expense resulting from the stock option investigation.

As part of the Company’s stock option investigation, the Company was required to record additional payroll tax expense for the periods affected by
the restatement. Although the statute for such taxes is closed through 2003, the Company recorded the additional payroll tax as if the statute were open, and then reversed the accrual for payroll tax when the statute closed. The Company reduced
payroll tax expense by $4.0 million and $0.8 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

As part of the 2003 restructuring activities, the Company had one significant leased property for which real estate taxes and utilities costs were not properly accounted for at the time of the restructuring. The
adjustment resulted in an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $3.8 million in 2003. Approximately $1.5 million of this adjustment was released in 2004 as part of the building was subleased to a third party and $2.3 million was released in
2005 when the remainder of the space was assumed by another tenant directly with the landlord.

During 2004, the Company adjusted the interest amortization on the note receivable from Network Solutions. This item was the result of adjusting the interest rate on the loan to a market rate. It was determined



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

that this adjustment would have increased other income in the fourth quarter of 2003 by $1.9 million. The Company originally booked the additional $1.9
million in 2004, which has since been reversed.

As a part of
VeriSign’s internal control processes during 2006, the Company detected an error related to the accounting for software maintenance amortization for various software license arrangements acquired from vendors. As a result of this error, the
Company increased software maintenance expenses by $203,000 in 2004, $2.5 million in 2005 and $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2006.

During 2006, the Company detected two errors related to the accounting at the Company’s Jamba subsidiary in Berlin, Germany. The first error relates
to the accounting for insurance revenues recorded after Jamba was acquired. The Company had not properly accounted for insurance renewal premiums on contracts that were renewed after the acquisition. The second error relates to the timing of certain
revenues, which were booked in incorrect periods. The combined impact of these errors increased revenues $2.3 million in 2004, $3.1 million in 2005 and $284,000 in the first quarter of 2006.

In the first quarter of 2006, the Company reversed $1.1 million of revenue to
account for billed services that were not delivered under contractual terms.

The following table presents the impact of the other adjustments that are not related to the stock option investigation for the periods presented:

(C)

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased primarily due to the restatement entries impact from a decrease in income taxes payable which was offset by an increase due to
additional liabilities related to the correction of the error with the software maintenance contracts.

(D)

The increase to additional paid-in-capital was primarily due to the impact of prior period changes to stock-based compensation expenses. The increase to accumulated deficit was
primarily due to the impact of prior period changes to stock-based compensation expenses. Please see the “Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity” for details on prior period adjustments.

On November 30, 2006, VeriSign completed its
acquisition of inCode Telecom Group, Inc. (“inCode”), a San Diego, California-based wireless and technology consulting company. VeriSign’s purchase price of $41.8 million consisted of approximately $40.2 million in cash consideration
and $1.6 million in direct transaction costs. Immediately upon closing, VeriSign paid $21.7 million of inCode’s outstanding principal debt and assumed liabilities. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the total
purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. inCode’s results of operations have been included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition of inCode, VeriSign recorded goodwill of $27.8 million and other intangible assets of $39.6 million, which have been assigned to the Communication Services Group
segment. The goodwill represents the excess value over both tangible and intangible assets acquired. The goodwill in this transaction is attributable to inCode’s strategic consulting services that will give VeriSign customers a competitive edge
in bringing advanced mobility solutions to market. None of the goodwill for inCode is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable assets acquired in the purchase of inCode is 7.1 years.
These identified other intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

material on an individual basis or in the aggregate when compared with VeriSign’s consolidated results.

2005 Acquisitions:

Retail Solutions International

On October 17, 2005, VeriSign completed its acquisition of Retail Solutions International, Inc. (“RSI”), a Lincoln, Rhode Island-based
privately held provider of operational point-of-sale data to the retail industry. VeriSign’s purchase price of $25.2 million for all of the outstanding capital stock and vested options of RSI consisted of approximately $23.2 million in cash
consideration and $0.4 million in direct transaction costs. VeriSign also assumed unvested stock options of RSI with a fair value of $1.6 million. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase of a business and, accordingly, the total
purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. RSI’s results of operations have been included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition of RSI, VeriSign recorded goodwill of $17.1 million and other

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

intangible assets of $6.4 million, which have been assigned to the Internet Services Group segment. The goodwill represents the excess value over both
tangible and intangible assets acquired. The goodwill in this transaction is attributable to the anticipated ability to increase the scope of services VeriSign offers to retail supply chain participants and enhances the infrastructure VeriSign has
been developing in the RFID/EPC and pharmaceutical supply chain markets to deliver real time, relevant data for decision making. None of the goodwill for RSI is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The overall weighted-average life of the
identified amortizable assets acquired in the purchase of RSI is 5.3 years. These identified other intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

The in-process research and development acquired in the RSI acquisition consisted primarily of research and development
efforts required for the completion of all planning, design, development, and test activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features, functions, and
performance.

VeriSign determined the fair value of the
acquired in-process research and development by estimating the projected cash flows related to the project or service and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the service. VeriSign discounted the resulting cash flows back to their
net present values. VeriSign based the net cash flows from such projects on its analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects. The in-process research and development was expensed upon
acquisition because they had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses.

The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of RSI was as follows:

Moreover
Technologies

On October 4, 2005, VeriSign completed

platform. None of the goodwill for Moreover is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable assets acquired in the purchase of Moreover is 5.5 years. These identified other intangible
assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

On November 18, 2005, the Company completed the sale of certain assets
related to its payment gateway business pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated October 10, 2005 (the “Agreement”), among PayPal, Inc., PayPal International Limited (collectively, “PayPal”), a wholly owned subsidiary
of eBay Inc. Under the Agreement, PayPal acquired certain assets related to VeriSign’s payment gateway business and assumed certain liabilities related thereto for $370 million in cash. The payment gateway business was part of the Internet
Services Group segment.

The Company has determined that the
disposed payment gateway business should be accounted for as discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No.144. Consequently, the results of operations of the payment gateway business have been excluded from the Company’s results from
continuing operations for all periods presented and have instead been presented as discontinued operations.

In connection with the sale of the payment gateway business, the Company entered into a Transitional Service Agreement (“TSA”) with PayPal to
provide certain transitional network and customer support services. The related fees were recorded as a direct reduction to the respective costs and expenses included in discontinued operations. The expected cash flows under the TSA do not represent
a significant continuation of the direct cash flows of the disposed payment gateway business. In April 2006, PayPal elected to terminate the customer support services provided by VeriSign under the TSA. In September 2006, PayPal elected to terminate
the billing services, production services and other transitional services provided under the TSA.

sublease income. During 2005, VeriSign recorded reversals of $2.9 million to its excess facilities primarily in connection with a decision to utilize and build a facility that VeriSign had treated as abandoned under its 2003 restructuring plan and
for which it had previously recorded a restructuring charge. As part of the restatement, VeriSign recorded a $2.3 million reversal in 2005 to correct a charge that was incorrectly expensed in 2005. The 2005 correction was properly expensed in 2003.

Exit costs.

other exit costs primarily relating to the realignment of its Communications Services Group segment.

Impairments and other charges

approvals and authorizations. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of liens, limitations on investments, limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness, limitations on mergers and acquisitions, limitations on
asset sales, limitations on dividends, share redemptions and other restricted payments, limitations on changing its business, limitations on entering into certain types of burdensome agreements and limitations on transactions with affiliates. The
Credit Agreement includes two financial covenants, including maintaining the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges above 2.50:1.00 for any four fiscal quarters, and maintaining the Leverage Ratio below 3.00:1.00 at any time
during any period of four fiscal quarters. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the Facility was 5.86%.

The Facility terminates on June 7, 2011 at which time outstanding borrowings under the Facility are due. VeriSign may optionally prepay loans under
the Credit Agreement other than Competitive Bid Loans at any time, without penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs in the case of LIBOR borrowings.

Note 11.    Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

VeriSign is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2006, no shares of preferred stock had been issued. In
connection with its stockholder rights plan, VeriSign authorized 3 million shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. In the event of liquidation, each preferred share will be entitled to a $1.00
preference, and thereafter the holders of the preferred shares will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 100 times the aggregate payment made per common share. Each preferred share will have 100 votes, voting together with the common shares.
Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which common shares are exchanged, each preferred share will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per common share. These rights are protected by customary
anti-dilution provisions.

Stock Repurchase Programs

To facilitate the stock repurchase program, designed to
return value to the stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, VeriSign repurchases shares in the open market and from time to time enters into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties.

In 2001, VeriSign and the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up
to $350 million of the Company’s common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase program was completed in the third quarter of 2005. In 2005, the Board of Directors of VeriSign authorized a new stock
repurchase program to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company’s common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase was completed in the second quarter of 2006. On May 16, 2006, the Board of Directors
of VeriSign authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to purchase shares of VeriSign’s common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has approximately $984.7 million
available under the 2006 stock repurchase program.

From the inception of
the stock purchase program in 2001 to December 31, 2006, a total of 35.3 million shares have been repurchased for a net purchase price of approximately $865.3 million.

Stockholder Rights Plan

On September 24, 2002, the Board of Directors of VeriSign declared a dividend of one stock purchase right (“Right”) for each outstanding
share of VeriSign common stock. The dividend was paid to stockholders of record on October 4, 2002 (“Record Date”). In addition, one Right shall be issued with each common share that becomes outstanding (i) between the Record
Date and the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) or (ii) following the Distribution Date and prior to the Redemption Date or Final Expiration
Date, pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities of VeriSign, which options or securities were outstanding prior to the Distribution Date. The
Rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Rights Agreement (“Rights Agreement”), including the acquisition of 20% of VeriSign’s outstanding common stock by a person or group. Each Right
entitles the registered holder, other than an “acquiring person”, under specified circumstances, to purchase from VeriSign one one-hundredth of a share of VeriSign Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share
(“Preferred Share”), at a price of $55.00 per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. In addition, each Right entitles the registered
holder, other than an “acquiring person”, under specified circumstances, to purchase from VeriSign that number of shares of VeriSign common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In February 2006,
VeriSign’s Board of Directors reviewed the stockholder rights plan and determined that it continues to be in the best interest of VeriSign and its stockholders. No cash dividends have been declared or paid on VeriSign’s common stock since
inception.

Note 12.    Calculation of Net Income
Per Share

In accordance with SFAS No. 128,
“

Earnings per Share

”, the Company computes basic income per share by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share
reflects the dilution of potential common shares outstanding such as stock options and unvested restricted stock awards during the period using the treasury stock method.

Note 13.    Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
123R. See Note 1 for a description of VeriSign’s adoption of SFAS 123R.

Stock Option Plans

The
majority of VeriSign’s stock-based compensation expense relates to stock options. Historically, stock options have been granted to broad groups of employees at most levels on a discretionary basis. In the second quarter of 2006, the
Compensation Committee, in consultation with other members of the Company’s Board of Directors, resolved to grant restricted stock units (“RSUs”) instead of stock options to employees below the director
level. Employees at or above the director level continue to be eligible to receive stock options as well as RSUs. As of December 31, 2006, a total of 58,304,920 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise
of stock options and for the future grant of stock options or awards under VeriSign’s equity incentive plans.

On May 26, 2006, the stockholders of VeriSign approved the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”). The 2006 Plan replaces VeriSign’s
1998 Directors Plan, 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2006 Plan authorizes the award of incentive stock options to employees and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock bonus
awards, stock appreciation rights and performance shares to eligible employees, officers, directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors. Options may be granted at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value of
VeriSign’s common stock on the date of grant. The 2006 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which may delegate to a committee of one or more members of VeriSign’s Board of Directors or
VeriSign’s officers the ability to grant awards and take certain other actions with respect to participants who are not executive officers or non-employee directors. All options have a term of not greater than 10 years from the date
of grant. Options issued generally vest 25% on the first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. A restricted stock unit is an award covering a number of shares of VeriSign common stock that may be settled in cash or
by issuance of those shares, which may consist of restricted stock. Restricted stock units will generally vest in four installments with 25% of the shares vesting on each anniversary of the date of grant over 4 years. The Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors, however, may authorize grants with a different vesting schedule in the future. 27,000,000 shares were authorized and reserved for issuance under the 2006 Plan.

The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (“2001 Plan”) was terminated upon approval of the 2006 Plan. Options to purchase
common stock granted under the 2001 Plan remain outstanding and subject to the vesting and exercise terms of the original grant. The 2001 Plan authorized the award of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards to eligible employees,
officers who are not subject to Section 16 reporting requirements, contractors and consultants. As of December 31, 2006, no restricted stock awards have been made under the 2001 Plan. Options were granted at an exercise price not less than
100% of the fair market value of VeriSign’s common stock on the date of grant. All options were granted at the discretion of the Board and have a term not greater than 10 years from the date of grant. Options issued generally vest 25% on the
first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. No further options can be granted under the 2001 Plan.

The 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (“1998 Plan”) was terminated upon approval of the 2006 Plan. Options to purchase common stock granted under the
1998 Plan remain outstanding and subject to the vesting and exercise terms of the original grant. The 1998 Plan authorized the award of options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock bonuses. Options were granted at an exercise
price not less than 100% of the fair market value of VeriSign’s common stock on the date of grant for incentive stock options and 85% of the fair market

value for non-qualified stock options. All options were granted at the discretion of the Board and have a term not greater than 7 years from the date of
grant. Options issued generally vest 25% on the first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units entitle the recipient to receive, at VeriSign’s discretion, shares or cash
upon vesting. No further options can be granted under the 1998 Plan.

The 1998 Directors Plan (“Directors Plan”) was terminated upon the approval of the 2006 Plan. Options to purchase common stock granted under the Directors Plan remain outstanding and subject to the vesting and exercise terms of
the original grant. Members of the Board who were not employees of VeriSign, or of any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of VeriSign, were eligible to participate in the Directors Plan. The option grants under the Directors Plan were automatic and
non-discretionary, and the exercise price of the options was 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Each eligible director was initially granted an option to purchase 25,000 shares on the date he or she first
became a director (“Initial Grant”). On each anniversary of a director’s Initial Grant or most recent grant if he or she was ineligible to receive an Initial Grant, each eligible director was automatically granted an additional option
to purchase 12,500 shares of common stock if the director had served continuously as a director since the date of the Initial Grant or most recent grant. The term of the options under the Directors Plan is ten years and options vest as to 6.25% of
the shares each quarter after the date of the grant, provided the optionee remains a director of VeriSign.

The 1995 Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Stock Option Plan (“1995 and 1997 Plans”) were terminated concurrent with VeriSign’s initial public
offering in 1998. Options to purchase common stock granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans remain outstanding and subject to the vesting and exercise terms of the original grant. All shares that remained available for future issuance under the 1995
and 1997 Plans at the time of their termination were transferred to the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan. No further options can be granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans. Options granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans are subject to terms substantially
similar to those described below with respect to options granted under the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

In connection with its acquisitions in 2005 and 2006, VeriSign assumed some of the acquired companies’ stock options. Options assumed generally have
terms of seven to ten years and generally vest over a four-year period, as set forth in the applicable option agreement.

1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

As of December 31, 2006, VeriSign has reserved 17,589,449 shares for issuance under the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“Purchase
Plan”). Eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions by electing to have between 2% and 15% of their compensation withheld. Each participant is granted an option to purchase common stock on the first day of each
24-month offering period and this option is automatically exercised on the last day of each six-month purchase period during the offering period. The purchase price for the common stock under the Purchase Plan is 85% of the lesser of the fair market
value of the common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or the last day of the applicable purchase period. Offering periods begin on February 1 and August 1 of each year. On January 1 of each year, the number of
shares available for grant under the Purchase Plan will automatically be increased by an amount equal to 1% of the outstanding common shares on the immediately preceding December 31.

Stock-based Compensation

On March 29, 2005, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, which provides the
Staff’s views on a variety of matters relating to stock-based payments. SAB 107 requires stock-based compensation to be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation. The following table sets forth the total stock-based
compensation recognized for the periods presented:

On August 9,
2006, the Company suspended stock option exercises (the “Restriction”) because it was unable to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Under various stock option plans, option holders must exercise
their vested stock options within a certain time period following termination of employment (typically, thirty (30), sixty (60) or ninety (90) days, depending on the plan). Due to the Restriction, certain terminated employees have been
unable to exercise their stock options prior to the expiration of this time period following termination of employment. As a result, VeriSign’s Board of Directors approved the following: (i) if the period to exercise the participant’s
stock options upon termination of employment has expired prior to the expiration of the Restriction, then such participant’s period to exercise his/her stock options upon termination of employment as set forth in the applicable plan is extended
by an additional forty five (45) days after the date the Restriction expires; and (ii) if the period remaining to exercise the participant’s stock options is less than forty five (45) days after the Restriction expires, then such
participant’s period to exercise his/her stock options upon termination of employment as set forth in the applicable plan is extended by an additional forty five (45) days minus the days remaining to exercise his/her stock options after the
date the Restriction expires. During the third quarter of 2006, VeriSign recognized $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense in connection with this extension of time for option exercise in accordance with SFAS 123R.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented unearned
compensation as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, on January 1, 2006 VeriSign reclassified the balance in unearned compensation to additional paid-in capital on its balance sheet.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

As of December 31, 2006, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options
and restricted stock awards was $94.1 million and $37.7 million, respectively, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years and 3.5 years, respectively. Stock-based compensation cost capitalized for internally
developed software was $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.

VeriSign currently uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and Purchase Plan options. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards using an
option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the
stock options and Purchase Plan options for the periods presented:

Under SFAS 123R,
VeriSign’s expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded
options. The risk-free interest rates are derived from the average U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates during the period, which approximate the rate in effect at the time of grant for the respective expected term. The expected terms are based on
the observed and expected time to post-vesting exercise and/or cancellation of options. VeriSign does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero. Under SFAS 123R, VeriSign
estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and records stock-based
compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.

The following table summarizes unvested restricted stock award activity for the periods presented:

Upon exercise of stock
options or vesting of restricted stock awards, VeriSign will issue common stock. To cover the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, the Company will place a sufficient portion of vested restricted stock awards into treasury and make a cash
payment to the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities to cover the applicable withholding taxes.

Stock Option Acceleration

On December 29, 2005, VeriSign’s Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of unvested and “out-of-the-money” stock
options that had an exercise price per share in excess of $24.99, all of which were previously granted under VeriSign’s stock option plans and that were outstanding on December 29, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 8.8 million
shares of common stock or 47% of the total outstanding unvested options on December 29, 2005 were subject to the acceleration. The options accelerated included certain options previously granted to executive officers and directors of VeriSign.

The acceleration was accompanied by restrictions imposed on
any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options. Those restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date (whether or not the
optionee is actually an employee at that time).

The purpose of
the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to reduce compensation expense associated with these options in future periods, beginning with the first quarter of 2006, in its consolidated financial statements, pursuant to SFAS 123R. The
acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to expenses in 2005. At the time of the acceleration, VeriSign estimated that the acceleration reduced stock-based compensation expense it otherwise would have been required to
record by approximately $27.7 million in 2006.

Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company adopted a policy of not including the net operating losses and research credit balances relating to options exercised prior to the adoption
of SFAS 123R in the above table. There was no effect to tax expense or additional paid-in capital upon the adoption of this policy; however, the effect on total deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance in the above table was a
decrease of $181.9 million from 2005 to 2006.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

In previous fiscal years, VeriSign provided a tax valuation allowance on its federal and state
deferred tax assets based on its evaluation that realizability of such assets was not “more likely than not”. The Company continuously evaluated additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the
realizability of the deferred tax assets. Such deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, temporary differences on tax-deductible goodwill and intangibles, and temporary differences on deferred revenue. In the
quarter ended June 30, 2006, based on new positive evidence including projected future taxable income from operating activities, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets would be realized. Accordingly, the
Company released its valuation allowance of $236.4 million from its deferred tax assets resulting in a benefit to deferred tax expense in its statement of income. The $236.4 million benefit consisted of a federal benefit of $207.2 million and a
state benefit of $29.2 million.

VeriSign continues to assess
the future realization of net deferred tax assets and believe that it is more likely than not that the tax effects of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities will be sufficient to support future
realization of net deferred tax assets.

However, VeriSign
continues to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets which we did not believe are more likely than not that they would be realized. The Company continues to apply a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to
capital loss carryforwards and to impaired investments, due to the limited carryforward period and character of such tax attributes and foreign net operating losses due to uncertainty of their realization. The amount of these deferred tax asset
which continue to be subject to a valuation allowance was $60.6 million as of December 31, 2006 and increased by approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $433.2 million,
state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $473.6 million, including federal and state net operating loss related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards of $460.5 million and $265.3 million respectively, when
recognized, will result in a benefit to additional paid-in capital of $172.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $32.3 million.

If VeriSign is not able to use them, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will expire in 2011 through 2026 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2007 through 2024. Most of the Company’s foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire, but could be subject to future
restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary.

As of December 31, 2006, VeriSign had federal research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately $30.4 million, state research and experimentation tax credits available for
future years of approximately $12.6 million. Included in these amounts are $7.9 million of federal, and $4.5 million of state research credit carryforwards generated from stock option exercises prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. The future
utilization of these attributes will result in recognition of the asset and a benefit to additional paid-in capital. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2011 through 2026. State research and
experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. VeriSign experienced
cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50% in 2003 and 2002. These changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on its ability to utilize certain U.S. federal and state



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

net operating loss carryforwards of $232.9 million and $116.5 million, respectively. Losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward, but
are subject to the expiration dates described above.

Deferred
income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The amount of such earnings included in consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 2006 was $121.7 million. These earnings have been permanently
reinvested and VeriSign does not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings.

In the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the Company was granted relief by
the IRS for an uncertainty regarding a tax benefit resulting from a prior divestiture. As a result, the Company benefited income tax expense $113.4 million, increased its deferred tax asset for net operating losses from continuing operations $51.8
million, and reduced income taxes payable $61.6 million. Also in the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the Company was granted relief by the IRS for an uncertainty regarding its ability to carry forward $191.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards
generated from stock option deductions in the year ended December 31, 2000. The relief resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets and an increase to the valuation allowance in the amount of $66.7 million. When the net operating loss is
utilized, the benefit will result in an addition to additional paid-in capital.

On March 19, 2007, the IRS commenced an examination of the Company’s federal tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company currently believes this examination will not have a material
impact on its financial statements; however the examination is still in progress.

Legal Proceedings

On September 7, 2001, NetMoneyIN, an Arizona
corporation, filed a complaint alleging patent infringement against VeriSign and several other previously-named defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona asserting infringement of U.S. patent Nos. 5,822,737 and
5,963,917. NetMoneyIN amended its complaint on October 15, 2002, alleging infringement by VeriSign and several other defendants of a third U.S. patent (No. 6,381,584) in addition to the two patents previously asserted. On August 27, 2003,
NetMoneyIN filed a third amended complaint alleging direct infringement of the same three patents by VeriSign and several other previously-named defendants. NetMoneyIN dropped its claim of active inducement of infringement by VeriSign. Some of the
other current defendants include IBM, BA Merchant Services, Wells Fargo Bank, Cardservice International, InfoSpace, E-Commerce Exchange and Paymentech. VeriSign filed an answer denying any infringement and asserting that the three asserted patents
are invalid and later filed an amended answer asserting, in addition, that the asserted patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The complaint alleged that VeriSign’s Payflow payment
products and services directly infringe certain claims of NetMoneyIN’s three patents and requested the Court to enter judgment in favor of NetMoneyIN, a permanent injunction against the defendants’ alleged infringing activities, an order
requiring defendants to provide an accounting for NetMoneyIN’s damages, to pay NetMoneyIN such damages and three times that amount for any willful infringers, and an order awarding NetMoneyIN attorney fees and costs. NetMoneyIN has withdrawn
its allegations of infringement of the ‘584 patent and the Court has dismissed with prejudice all claims of infringement of the ‘584 patent. In its ruling on the claim construction issues, the Court found four of the five claims asserted
against VeriSign, claims 1, 13 and 14 of the ‘737 patent and claim 1 of the ‘917 patent, invalid. NetMoneyIN may file an appeal after a final judgment seeking to overturn this ruling. Thus,

only claim 23 of the ‘737 patent remains in the case. The Court granted the defendants’ motion to strike certain of the Plaintiff’s assertions
of infringement, including all charges of infringement under the so-called “doctrine of equivalents.” The Court recently granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment of no inducement and no contributory infringement. Fact and
expert witness discovery are completed. On September 29, 2006, VeriSign filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on Non-Infringement. On October 20, 2006, VeriSign filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on Invalidity. On November 1,
2006, NetMoneyIN filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on Infringement. On July 9, 2007, the Court is scheduled to hear oral argument on the pending motions for summary judgment. While we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit, VeriSign
believes that the allegations are without merit.

Beginning in
May of 2002, several class action complaints were filed against VeriSign and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. These actions were consolidated under
the heading In re VeriSign, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. C-02-2270 JW (HRL), on July 26, 2002. The consolidated action seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a class of persons who purchased VeriSign stock from January 25, 2001 through April 25, 2002. An amended consolidated complaint was filed on November 8, 2002. On April 14,
2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended and consolidated complaint. On May 5, 2004, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that was substantially identical to the amended
consolidated complaint except that it purported to add a claim under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of a subclass of persons who acquired shares of VeriSign pursuant to the registration statement and prospectus filed
October 10, 2001 and amended October 26, 2001 for the acquisition of Illuminet Holdings, Inc. by VeriSign. Plaintiffs’ second amended class action complaint was dismissed by the court on November 2, 2005
for failure to adequately plead loss causation. Plaintiffs were given leave to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a third amended class action Complaint on December 22, 2005. Defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the third amended complaint. On April 6, 2006, that motion was granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint on May 12, 2006. Plaintiffs’ request for reconsideration of the April 6,
2006 order was granted on June 5, 2006. Plaintiffs filed a fifth amended complaint on June 30, 2006. VeriSign moved to dismiss the fifth amended complaint. Parallel derivative actions have also been filed against certain of VeriSign’s
current and former officers and directors in state courts in California and Delaware. VeriSign is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. Several of these derivative actions were filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court of California and
these actions have since been consolidated under the heading In re VeriSign, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case No. CV 807719.

The consolidated derivative action seeks unspecified damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the California Corporations Code.
Defendants’ demurrer to these claims was granted with leave to amend on February 4, 2003. Plaintiffs have indicated their intention to file an amended complaint. Another derivative action was filed in the Court of Chancery New Castle
County, Delaware, Case No. 19700-NC, alleging similar breaches of fiduciary duty. Defendants’ motion to dismiss these claims was granted by the Court of Chancery with prejudice on September 30, 2003.

On April 24, 2007, the District Court entered Final Judgment and Order
dismissing the Securities Litigation with prejudice based on final approval of the parties settlement of the Securities Litigation and the Derivative Litigation. On May 15, 2007, the State Court entered a final Stipulation and Proposed of
Dismissal with Prejudice of the Derivative Litigation. Under the terms of the settlement, liability insurers for the Company and its directors and officers paid $80 million in settlement of the lawsuits, within applicable insurance limits. The time
for appeal in both matters has now passed.

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

On August 27, 2004, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN in the Superior Court of the State of
California Los Angeles County. The lawsuit alleges that ICANN breached its

.com

Registry Agreement with VeriSign, including, without limitation, by overstepping its contractual authority and improperly attempting to regulate our business. The
complaint seeks, among other things, specific performance of the

.com

Registry Agreement, an injunction prohibiting ICANN from improperly regulating VeriSign, and monetary damages. On November 12, 2004, ICANN filed an answer denying
VeriSign’s claims and a cross-complaint against VeriSign for declaratory relief and breach of the .com Registry Agreement, alleging that VeriSign’s introduction of new services breached the .com Agreement. ICANN seeks a declaration from
the court that it has acted in compliance with the parties’ contractual obligations with regard to the .com registry; that VeriSign has breached the parties’ agreement through VeriSign’s actions with respect to, among other things,
SiteFinder; and that ICANN has the right to terminate the

.com

registry agreement if VeriSign offers “Registry Services” without ICANN’s approval, including among others SiteFinder. On December 28, 2004, VeriSign filed an
answer denying the claims in ICANN’s cross-complaint and a cross-complaint against ICANN for breach of contract, violation of the unfair competition laws, and declaratory relief, alleging, among other things, that ICANN’s accreditation of
“thread” registrars is improper and causes direct injury to VeriSign. On February 14, 2005, ICANN filed an answer to VeriSign’s cross-complaint denying VeriSign’s allegations.

On or about November 12, 2004, ICANN filed a Request for Arbitration
before the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration (the “ICC”) alleging that VeriSign violated its 2001

.net

Registry Agreement with ICANN when, among other things, VeriSign operated the SiteFinder
service without ICANN approval. ICANN seeks a declaration from the ICC that it has acted in compliance with the parties’ contractual obligations with regard to the .net registry; that VeriSign has breached the parties’ agreement through
VeriSign’s actions with respect to, among other things, SiteFinder; and that ICANN has the right to terminate the .net registry agreement if VeriSign offers “Registry Services” without ICANN’s approval, including among others
SiteFinder. ICANN also seeks a declaration that, in evaluating VeriSign’s bid to become the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain after the term of the 2001 agreement expires on or about June 30, 2005, ICANN
is entitled to consider VeriSign’s alleged breaches of the existing agreement. VeriSign cannot predict the outcome of this action or the affect this lawsuit will have on our relationship with ICANN.

On January 18, 2005, VeriSign filed a request for arbitration before the
ICC against ICANN regarding the process by which ICANN solicited and reviewed bids from companies, including VeriSign, to become the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain after the 2001 Registry Agreement expired on
or about June 30, 2005. VeriSign alleges that the “request for proposal” (“RFP”) process constitutes a breach of the 2001 .net registry agreement because, among other things, the RFP process fails to constitute an open and
transparent process by which ICANN can reasonably select the best qualified successor to operate the .net registry and does not constitute a valid “consensus policy” as defined in the 2001 .net agreement. ICANN has not yet responded to our
arbitration request. On June 8, 2005, ICANN announced that it had selected VeriSign as the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain, and ICANN and VeriSign have entered into a contract to confirm that selection.
VeriSign anticipates that its selection as the .net registry operator will resolve its request for arbitration.

In October 2005, the Company and ICANN announced a proposed settlement of the various claims between them. The settlement was conditioned upon, among
other things, approval of the agreement by the United States Department of Commerce. On November 29, 2006, the United States Department of Commerce approved the new .com Registry Agreement. With that approval, the settlement is finalized and
implemented. Accordingly, pending litigation with ICANN was dismissed.

On February 14, 2005, Southeast Texas Medical Associates, LLP filed a putative class action
lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, alleging violations of the unfair competition laws, breach of express warranty and unjust enrichment relating to our Secure Site Pro SSL certificates. The complaint is brought on behalf of a class of
persons who purchased the Secure Site Pro certificate from February 2001 to present. On April 17, 2006, the class was certified and class notice was issued on May 21, 2007. VeriSign disputes these claims. While we cannot predict the
outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

On March 8, 2005, plaintiff Charles Ford filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, alleging fraud, negligent misrepresentation, false advertising, and
violations of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act and unfair competition laws relating to marketing and advertising of mobile phone “ringtones” and other content by VeriSign’s subsidiaries, Jamster International Sarl and
Jamba! GmbH. The complaint is brought on behalf of classes of persons who responded to advertising by sending a text message on their mobile phones or registered over the Internet to purchase ringtone or other content. On April 18, 2005,
VeriSign removed the action to the federal district court for the Southern District of California. VeriSign disputes the claims in this action. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without
merit.

On April 11, 2005, Prism Technologies, LLC filed a
complaint against VeriSign in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that VeriSign’s “Go Secure suite of application and related hardware and software products and its Unified Authentication solution and related
hardware and software products, including the VeriSign Identity Protection (“VIP”) product” infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,516,416, entitled “Subscription Access System for Use With an Untrusted Network.” Prism Technologies
seeks judgment in favor of Prism Technologies, a permanent injunction from infringement, damages in an amount not less than a reasonable royalty, attorneys’ fees and costs. Prism Technologies has also named RSA Security, Inc., Netegrity, Inc.
Computer Associates International, Inc and Johnson & Johnson as co-defendants. VeriSign responded on June 6, 2005 by filing a counterclaim for declaratory relief and an answer denying any infringement and asserting that the patent
is invalid. On November 9, 2006, the Court held a Markman claim construction hearing. On February 9, 2007, Plaintiff withdrew its claim against Go Secure, leaving claims against Unified Authentication and VIP. On April 2, 2007,
the Court issued a ruling from the Markman claim construction hearing. On April 13, 2007, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Leave to File Amended Answers and Counterclaims to add an inequitable conduct defense. On April 23,
2007, on the basis of the Markman claim construction ruling, the Court entered a stipulated Final Judgment of Non-Infringement, dismissing all claims and counterclaims in the case. On April 27, 2007, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal to
the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

On June 2, 2005, the Company received an access letter from the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission for information to determine whether VeriSign, using the trade name Jamster, was engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act in its advertising,
offering and billing for content services and products. The Company also received civil investigative demands from the Illinois State Attorney General (dated June 30, 2005) and from the Florida State Attorney General (dated October 6,
2005). Each of these letters requested information related to the marketing of Jamster ringtone and other downloadable content services.

In August 2005 and October 2005, respectively, VeriSign received two additional similar putative class action lawsuits, one in state court in Arkansas
(short title, Page v. VeriSign), alleging claims for fraud, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and one in federal district court for the

Southern District of California (short title, Herrington v. VeriSign), alleging claims for fraud, negligence and negligent misrepresentation, unjust
enrichment, quantum meruit, breach of contract, breach of warranty, false advertising, and unfair competition. These lawsuits relate to the marketing and advertising of mobile phone “ringtones” and other mobile phone content by VeriSign
and its subsidiary Jamster International Sarl. VeriSign disputes the claims in these actions. On April 14, 2006 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings in the Ford, Page, and Herrington
actions (short title, In Re Jamster Marketing Litigation). On June 16, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conditionally transferred one additional similar putative class action lawsuit, alleging violations of the Illinois
Consumer Fraud Act and Illinois Automatic Contract Renewal Act (short title, Harmon v. VeriSign), from the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois to the federal district court for the Southern District of California, where it
will be coordinated with the Ford matter for pretrial proceedings. Similarly, on September 14, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conditionally transferred another similar putative class action lawsuit, alleging violations of
Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (short title, Edwards v. VeriSign), from the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida to the federal district court for the Southern District of California, where it will
likely be coordinated with the Ford matter for pretrial proceedings. While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, VeriSign believes the allegations are without merit.

On February 24, 2006, GEMA, the German music authors collecting society, submitted an application to the Schiedsstelle,
an arbitration board responsible for copyright matters at the German Patent and Copyright Office, requesting arbitration of GEMA’s claim for alleged underpaid royalties in connection with Jamba GmbH’s sale of ringtones as
downloadable content for mobile phones. Jamba is a wholly owned subsidiary of VeriSign, Inc. Jamba pays royalties to GEMA on a “per download” basis for ringtones. GEMA claims that Jamba should also pay royalties
for all GEMA-represented ringtones made available to Jamba customers, regardless of whether or not the content represented by GEMA has been downloaded by a Jamba customer. On April 11, 2006, the Schiedsstelle notified Jamba! that
it will conduct an arbitration of GEMA’s claim. Jamba submitted a response to GEMA’s application on May 22, 2006. GEMA submitted an answer to Jamba’s response on August 6, 2006. Jamba submitted a reply to
GEMA’s answer on or about October 23, 2006. Arbitration has not yet been scheduled. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

On June 26, 2006, VeriSign received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S.
Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents relating to VeriSign’s stock option grants and practices. VeriSign also received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requesting
documents related to VeriSign’s stock option grants and practices. On February 9, 2007, VeriSign received a formal order of investigation from the SEC. VeriSign is cooperating fully with the U.S. Attorney’s investigation and
the SEC investigation.

On July 6, 2006, a stockholder
derivative complaint (Parnes v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) was filed against the Company, as a nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former directors and executive officers related to certain historical stock
option grants. The complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of VeriSign, constructive trust and other equitable relief. Two other derivative actions were filed, one in federal court (Port Authority v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign), and one
in state court (Port Authority v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) on August 14, 2006. VeriSign is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. The federal actions have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on
November 20, 2006. Motions to dismiss the consolidated federal court complaint were heard on May 23, 2007. Motions to stay the state court action are pending. On May 15, 2007, a putative class action (Mykityshyn v. Bidzos, et al., and

and disclosure failures regarding certain historical stock option grants. The plaintiff purports to represent all individuals who owned VeriSign common stock
between April 3, 2002 and August 9, 2006. The complaint seeks rescission of amendments to the 1998 and 2006 Option Plans and the cancellation of shares added to the 1998 Option Plan. The complaint also seeks to enjoin defendants from
granting any stock options and from allowing the exercise of any currently outstanding options granted under the 1998 and 2006 Option Plans. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, costs and attorneys fees. The matter was
removed to federal court on June 25, 2007. VeriSign and the individual defendants dispute all of these claims.

On November 7, 2006, a judgment was entered against VeriSign by an Italian trial court in the matter of Penco v. VeriSign, Inc., for Euro
5.8 million plus fees arising from a lawsuit brought by a former consultant who claimed to be owed commissions. VeriSign was granted a stay on execution of the judgment. VeriSign has appealed the lower court’s ruling on the
merits and the hearing on the appeal is likely to be scheduled in May 2008. VeriSign believes the claims are without merit.

On November 30, 2006, Freedom Wireless, Inc. filed a complaint against VeriSign and other defendants alleging that VeriSign infringes certain patents
by making, using, selling or supplying products, methods or services relating to supplying prepaid wireless telephone services to telecommunications companies. VeriSign filed an answer to the complaint on January 25, 2007. The lawsuit is
pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. No scheduling conference has been set. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to
vigorously defend against them.

On January 31, 2007,
VeriSign and News Corporation finalized a joint venture giving News Corporation a controlling interest in VeriSign’s wholly owned Jamba subsidiary. Accordingly, effective January 31, 2007, VeriSign transferred to the joint venture
direction and control of all litigation relating to Jamba! GmbH and Jamster International Sarl. Litigation and other legal matters covered by that transfer include, but are not limited to, In Re Jamster Marketing Litigation (Ford, Page, Herrington,
Harmon and Edwards), the Federal Trade Commission access letter, the Illinois Attorney General Civil Investigative Demand, the Florida Attorney General Subpoena Duces Tecum, and the GEMA application for arbitration.

On May 31, 2007, plaintiffs Karen Herbert, et al., on behalf of
themselves and a nationwide class of consumers, filed a complaint against VeriSign, Inc., m-Qube, Inc., and other defendants alleging that defendants collectively operate an illegal lottery under the laws of multiple states by
allowing viewers of the NBC television show “Deal or No Deal” to incur premium text message charges in order to participate in an interactive television promotion called “Lucky Case Game.” The lawsuit is pending in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend
against them.

On June 5, 2007, plaintiffs Cheryl Bentley,

On June 7, 2007, plaintiffs Michael and Michele Hardin, on behalf of themselves and a
nationwide class of consumers, filed a complaint against VeriSign, Inc. and other defendants alleging that defendants collectively operate various “gambling games” in violation of Georgia state law. Plaintiffs
allege that interactive television promotions contained in various broadcasts, including NBC’s “Deal or No Deal,” wrongly permit participants to incur premium text message charges in order to participate in the promotions to
win a prize. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Gainesville Division. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

VeriSign is involved in various other investigations, claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business, none of which, in our opinion will harm its business. VeriSign cannot assure that it will prevail in any litigation.
Regardless of the outcome, any litigation may require VeriSign to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention.

Indemnification

VeriSign enters into indemnification agreements with many of its customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business. These
agreements include provisions for indemnifying the customer, or business partner, applicable, against claims brought by third-parties that allege a VeriSign product infringes a patent, copyright or trademark, misappropriates a trade secret, or
violates other proprietary rights of that third-party. These indemnification obligations are generally subject to limits as specified in the agreement. It is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments VeriSign could be
required to make under these indemnification agreements. To date, VeriSign has not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to indemnification agreements. VeriSign has not recorded any liabilities for these
indemnification agreements at December 31, 2006 or 2005.

At the Company’s discretion and in the ordinary course of business, VeriSign subcontracts the performance of certain services. VeriSign enters into indemnification agreements that indemnify customers against certain losses caused by
the Company’s employees and subcontractors. These indemnification obligations are generally subject to limits as specified in the agreement. It is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments VeriSign could be
required to make under these indemnification agreements. The Company maintains insurance policies that may enable VeriSign to recover a portion of any such claim. VeriSign has not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification agreements at
December 31, 2006 or 2005.

Note 16.    Segment Information

Description of Segments

VeriSign operates its business in two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group.

VeriSign is currently organized into two reportable service-based segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. The
Internet Services Group consists of the Security Services business and the Information Services business. The Security Services business provides products and services that protect online and network interactions, enabling companies to manage
reputational, operational and compliance risks. The Information Services business is the authoritative directory provider of all

publisher services and digital brand management services. The Communications Services Group provides communications services, such as connectivity and
interoperability services and intelligent database services; commerce services, such as billing and operational support system services, mobile commerce, self-care and analytics services; and content services, such as digital content and messaging
services.

The segments were determined based primarily on how
the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) views and evaluates VeriSign’s operations. VeriSign’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM as defined by SFAS No. 131, “

Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information.

” Other factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels, were also considered in determining the reportable segments. Additionally, the performance of the
Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group is the measure used by the CODM for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources between the segments.

The accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are generally the same as those described in Note 1.

The following table reflects the results of VeriSign’s
reportable segments:

Network Solutions. During 2005, VeriSign recognized a gain of $8.2 million on the sale of an equity investment that was previously impaired. During 2004, VeriSign sold 18,000 ordinary shares of its Tokyo-based, majority owned consolidated
subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K., representing a gain of approximately $74.9 million related to the sale. Other, net primarily consists of foreign exchange rate gains and losses and in 2005 it includes approximately $6.0 million of other income
related to a litigation settlement with a telecommunication carrier.

Note 19.    Subsequent Events

In January 2007, VeriSign initiated a restructuring plan to execute a company-wide reorganization replacing the previous business unit structure with a new combined worldwide sales and services team, and an integrated development and
products organization. The restructuring plan included workforce reductions, abandonment of excess facilities, disposals of property and equipment, and other charges. In the first quarter of 2007, VeriSign recorded approximately $26.9 million in
restructuring charges.

As of January 2007, the Company suspended the purchase of shares under its Purchase Plan because it
was not current in its financial reporting under applicable regulations of the SEC. The Company refunded payroll withholdings from employees in February 2007 for the offering period ended January 31, 2007. As of the date of this report, no
further payroll withholdings were made in 2007.

On
January 31, 2007, VeriSign finalized two joint venture agreements with Fox Entertainment (“Fox”), a subsidiary of News Corporation, to provide mobile entertainment to consumers on a global basis. Under the terms of the agreements, Fox
owns a 51% interest and VeriSign owns a 49% interest in the joint ventures. One of the joint ventures, Netherlands Mobile Holdings, C.V., is based in the Netherlands, and the other is based in the United States. VeriSign contributed its wholly-owned
subsidiary Jamba to the Netherlands joint venture and Fox contributed its Fox Mobile Entertainment assets to the U.S.-based joint venture. Fox paid VeriSign approximately $192.4 million in cash for its contribution of the Jamba subsidiary and
VeriSign paid Fox approximately $4.9 million in cash for its contribution of Fox Mobile Entertainment assets.

In the first quarter of 2007, VeriSign decided to sell our wholly-owned Jamba Services GmbH subsidiary. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the
