PART
       I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

VeriSign is the leading
       provider of Internet-based trust services, including authentication,
       validation and payment, needed by websites, enterprises, electronic
       commerce service providers, and individuals to conduct trusted and
       secure electronic commerce and communications over wired and wireless
       Internet protocol (IP) networks. We have established strategic
       relationships with industry leaders, including BT, Cisco, Microsoft,
       Netscape, RSA Security and VISA, to enable widespread utilization of our
       digital certificate services and to assure their interoperability with a
       wide variety of applications and network equipment. We have used our
       secure online infrastructure to issue over 215,000 of our website
       digital certificates and over 3.9 million of our digital certificates
       for individuals. We believe that we have issued more digital
       certificates than any other company in the world. Our Website Digital
       Certificate services are used by all of the Fortune 500 companies with a
       web presence and all of the top 40 electronic commerce websites as
       listed by Jupiter Communications. We also provide enterprise digital
       certificate services which allow enterprises and electronic commerce
       service providers to leverage our trusted service infrastructure to
       develop and deploy customized digital certificate services for use by
       their employees, customers and business partners. Over 800 enterprises
       and electronic commerce service providers have subscribed to our managed
       certificate services since their introduction in November 1997,
       including Agilent, Bank of America, Barclays, General Electric
       Information Systems, Hewlett-Packard, the Internal Revenue Service,
       Southwest Securities, Sumitomo Bank, Texas Instruments, VISA and US
       West. We market our Internet-based trust services worldwide through
       multiple distribution channels, including the Internet, direct sales,
       telesales, VARs, systems integrators and our network of over twenty
       affiliates which provide trust services under licensed co-branding
       relationships using our technology and business practices.

Recent
       Events

In December 1999, we announced
       that we would acquire Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. (“Thawte”),
       a privately held South African company that provides digital
       certificates to websites and software developers. We completed this
       acquisition on February 2000 and issued approximately 4.4 million shares
       of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
       Thawte. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and,
       accordingly, the results of Thawte’s operations will be included in
       our consolidated financial statements from the date of
       acquisition.

Also in December 1999, we
       announced that we would acquire Signio, Inc. (“Signio”), a
       privately held company that provides payment services that connect
       online merchants, business-to-business exchanges,
     payment processors and financial institutions on the Internet. We
       completed this acquisition on February 2000 and issued approximately 5.6
       million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the
       outstanding shares of Signio and we also assumed Signio’s
       outstanding employee stock options. The transaction will be accounted
       for as a purchase.

We announced in March 2000,
       that we would acquire Network Solutions, Inc. (“Network Solutions
       ”), a publicly held company that provides Internet domain name
       registration and global registry services. Based on the completion of a
       2-for-1 stock split of Network Solution’s common stock on March 10,
       2000, we will issue 1.075 shares of our common stock in exchange for all
       the outstanding shares of Network Solutions. In addition, any options or
       warrants to purchase Network Solutions capital stock will be exchanged,
       as applicable, to purchase VeriSign common stock according to the
       exchange ratio. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase. The
       acquisition is subject to customary conditions of closing including
       approval by both the VeriSign and Network Solutions
       stockholders.

VeriSign
       ’s Trust Services

VeriSign’s Internet-based
       trust services are built upon its proprietary WorldTrust software
       platform, scalable operations infrastructure and comprehensive security
       and trust practices. Our secure data centers, designed to provide
       carrier-class reliability with advanced security procedures, allow the
       issuance and management of millions of digital certificates.
       Furthermore, because we have worked with industry leaders to embed our
       digital certificate interface technology into a wide range of software
       applications and network equipment, such as Netscape and Microsoft
       browsers and servers and Cisco routers, our services are interoperable
       with a wide range of IP-based applications. By providing a trusted
       platform for commerce and communications, we are able to offer services,
       including authentication, validation and payment to customers with a
       wide range of needs. Our current service offerings are targeted towards
       three primary areas: Website Digital Certificate services, Enterprise
       Digital Certificate services and VeriSign Affiliate Certificate
       services.

Website
         Digital Certificate Services

VeriSign’s family of
       Website Digital Certificate services allows organizations to implement
       and operate secure websites that utilize the SSL and WTLS protocols to
       establish their identity to customers and other websites during
       electronic commerce transactions and communications over wired or
       wireless IP networks. Prior to issuing a digital certificate for a
       website’s server, we establish the authenticity of the website
       through a series of background checks, including corroborating an
       organization’s authority to do business under a given name and
       their authority to operate a server with a specific domain name or URL.
       These practices protect organizations against another entity
       impersonating their identity and allow online visitors and customers to
       conduct private transactions and communications. Without a digital
       certificate installed on the website server the SSL and WTLS protocols
       cannot be utilized.

Our Website Digital
       Certificate services are utilized by a broad range of merchant,
       financial and government websites, as well as for intranet applications.
       We currently offer two primary versions of our Website Digital
       Certificate services, as well as several distinct versions, each
       differentiated by the target application of the server that hosts the
       digital certificate.

Secure Site and
         Secure Site Plus Services

.    Secure Site is
         our standard service offering that enables websites to implement basic
         SSL security features between their sites and individual end-user
         browsers. Secure Site includes certificate issuance, certificate
         lifecycle management, administration functions, records retention,
         directory integration and transaction security. We also offer an
         upgraded version of this service, called Secure Site Plus, that
         includes security monitoring, security assessment, site performance
         monitoring and additional warranty protection.

Global Site and
         Global Site Plus Services

.    Global Site is
         an advanced version of Secure Site that incorporates all of the
         features and functionality of our Secure Site services that allows
         U.S. and international enterprises to offer stronger 128-bit encrypted
         SSL sessions between their websites and
       specially configured end-user browsers from Netscape and Microsoft. We
         offer the only commercially available certificates for Netscape and
         Microsoft that utilize 128-bit encryption. This service is typically
         targeted to global financial institutions and online merchants that
         require enhanced security. We also offer an upgraded version of this
         service, called Global Site Plus that includes security monitoring,
         security assessment, site performance monitoring and additional
         warranty protection.

WAP Server
         Certificates

.    WAP Server Certificates
         provide authentication and encryption between wireless web servers and
         mobile devices utilizing WTLS (wireless transport layer security
         protocol). Our WAP server certificate service is compatible with WAP
         servers from Motorola, Nokia, Phone.com and others.

In addition to our core
       Website Digital Certificate services, we offer content signing
       certificates. Content Signing digital certificates for developers enable
       content providers, publishers and vendors to digitally sign their
       content or Internet subscription “channels” in order to ensure
       authenticity and integrity of the content delivered to
       end-users.

Our Website Digital
       Certificate services are offered on an annual subscription basis for
       prices between $250 and $1,200 per server per year, depending on the
       version of digital certificate requested and the overall volume of
       website digital certificates used by the customer. Customers can
       subscribe to the Website Digital Certificate services through the
       VeriSign website, through selected international service providers or
       through VeriSign’s Enterprise Digital Certificate
       services.

Enterprise
         Digital Certificate Services

VeriSign’s Enterprise
       Digital Certificate services are sold under the VeriSign OnSite and
       VeriSign Go Secure! brands, and are tailored to meet the specific needs
       of corporations, electronic commerce service providers, financial
       institutions, healthcare organizations, government agencies and other
       enterprises that wish to issue digital certificates to employees,
       customers, citizens or trading partners.

OnSite Services

.
             OnSite Services support a wide range of
         digital certificate needs for both small and large user communities.
         OnSite can be used by customers to provide digital certificates for a
         variety of applications, including: controlling access to sensitive
         data and account information, enabling digitally-signed e-mail,
         creating an online electronic trading community, managing supply chain
         interaction or facilitating and protecting online credit card
         transactions. The OnSite service is designed to offer customers ease
         of use at a low initial investment combined with broad flexibility and
         scalability. OnSite services vary based on the nature and complexity
         of the application and the degree of control customers desire to
         maintain.

Go Secure!
         Services

.    Go Secure! was introduced in June
         1999 to provide managed applications services that enable enterprises
         to quickly build digital certificate-based security into their
         transaction and communication applications faster and more easily. Go
         Secure! services are similar in functionality to our OnSite Services
         and are designed to incorporate digital certificates into existing
         e-mail, browsing applications, directory and virtual private network
         devices.

To expand and complement our
       Enterprise Digital Certificate services, we provide a professional
       services group that includes experts in digital certificate architecture
       and application integration. Our professional services group provides a
       variety of design, development and implementation services. These
       services include integration with existing applications and databases,
       consulting on policies and procedures related to the management and
       deployment of digital certificates, training classes on the latest
       developments in security technology and the selection of enabled
       software and hardware to complement a digital certificate
       solution.

The Enterprise Digital
       Certificate services are offered as an annual subscription service with
       pricing dependent upon the number of users to be supported, the
       complexity of the applications and the number of additional services
       provided. Pricing typically ranges from $10,000 to $500,000 per year.
       Customers can
     subscribe to the OnSite service through the VeriSign website, VeriSign
       ’s direct sales force, selected international and domestic service
       providers or system integrators.

VeriSign
         Affiliate Certificate Services

VeriSign Affiliate Certificate
       Services are targeted at a wide variety of organizations that provide
       large-scale electronic commerce and communications services over wired
       and wireless IP networks. Examples include telecommunications companies,
       Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, financial and other professional
       services firms, electronic commerce service providers and businesses
       that operate Internet-based “communities of interest,” such as
       a web portal. These companies typically desire to offer digital
       certificate services to their customers under either the VeriSign brand
       or a co-branding relationship. In many cases, these digital certificate
       services are integrated with other value-added services offered by the
       organization. For example, an ISP may offer website digital certificates
       in conjunction with its website hosting services for small and medium
       size businesses, while a community of interest operator may offer
       digital certificates to each member of the community in order to support
       user authentication and secure messaging services. VeriSign designates
       these types of organizations “VeriSign Affiliates” and
       provides them with a combination of technology, support and marketing
       services to facilitate their initial deployment and on-going delivery of
       digital certificate services.

VeriSign Affiliate Certificate
       Services are delivered through either the VeriSign Service Center or
       VeriSign Processing Center offerings. Both offerings are based on the
       WorldTrust software platform and enable a licensed VeriSign Affiliate to
       offer one or more types of digital certificate services.

VeriSign Service
         Center

.    The VeriSign Service Center
         provides a VeriSign Affiliate with all of the capabilities needed to
         perform subscriber enrollment and authentication, digital certificate
         issuance, directory hosting, customer support, billing integration and
         report generation from within their facilities while leveraging
         VeriSign’s secure data centers for back-end
         processing.

VeriSign Processing
         Center

.    The VeriSign Processing Center
         provides a VeriSign Affiliate with all of the capabilities of the
         Service Center plus the WorldTrust modules required to perform all
         certificate processing functions from within their own secure data
         center.

VeriSign also provides each
       VeriSign Affiliate with the appropriate business readiness services to
       facilitate the efficient and timely rollout of their digital certificate
       offerings. These readiness services may include Service or Processing
       Center installation and integration services, facility and network
       design consulting, technical and customer support documentation and
       training, sales and marketing support, operating practice templates and
       local market customization.

VeriSign Affiliates that agree
       to conform to certain standards are also offered membership in the
       VeriSign Trust Network, an international network of digital certificate
       service providers that operate with common technology, infrastructure
       and practices to enable digital certificate interoperability on a
       worldwide basis. VeriSign currently has affiliates located in Australia
       (eSign), Brazil (Certisign), Canada (CIBC and VPN Tech), France
       (CertPlus), Germany (Comparex Holdings), Japan (VeriSign Japan), Korea
       (CrossCert), Middle East (Arabtrust), Netherlands (KPN Telecom),
       Netherlands/Belgium and Luxembourg (Roccade Megaplex), South Africa
       (SACA), Taiwan (Acer HiTrust) and the United Kingdom (BT Trustwise) as
       well as several other countries.

VeriSign Affiliates typically
       enter into a technology licensing and revenue sharing agreement with
       VeriSign whereby VeriSign receives up-front licensing fees for the
       Service Center or Processing Center technology, as well as ongoing
       royalties for each digital certificate issued by the VeriSign Affiliate.
       Initial licensing fees typically range from $250,000 to $2 million, and
       royalties can range from 20% to 70% of the net revenue received by the
       VeriSign Affiliate for each digital certificate.

Customers and
       Markets

VeriSign has a broad customer
       base from a variety of industry groups that require trusted and secure
       electronic commerce and communications over IP networks. Following is a
       representative list of customers that have purchased VeriSign’s
       services:

VISA accounted for
       approximately 10% of our revenues in 1997. No other customer accounted
       for 10% or more of our revenues during 1999, 1998 or 1997.

Technology

VeriSign employs a modular set
       of software applications and toolkits, which collectively make up its
       proprietary WorldTrust platform, as the core platform for all of its
       Internet-based trust services. The modular design of the WorldTrust
       platform enables our trust services to be distributed over one or many
       co-located or dispersed computer systems, allowing certain functions of
       the certification process, such as registration, authentication,
       issuance, revocation, renewal or replacement, to be deployed at customer
       or affiliate locations while maintaining a secure and reliable link to
       one of our secure data centers for back-end processing. These modules
       can also be replicated in order to handle increased volumes of digital
       certificates. Digital certificate service modules incorporated in the
       WorldTrust platform include:

Subscriber Services
         Module.

Our subscriber services module
         supports requests for digital certificate issuance, revocation,
         renewal and replacement. Software toolkits are provided to permit
         rapid customization and integration of digital certificate services
         with a customer’s business-specific web-based
         solutions.

Authentication
         Services Module.

Our authentication
         services module supports manual, automated and delegated
         authentication of subscribers by designated sources prior to digital
         certificate issuance. We provide software toolkits and programming
         interfaces to allow for integration with various process models and
         database systems.

Administration
         and Support Modules.

Our administration and
         support modules provide lifecycle services such as digital certificate
         revocation, renewal and reissuance, as well as a customer support
         knowledge base to facilitate general reporting of CA activity, and
         web-based and e-mail-based support for customers and end
         users.

Directory Services
         Module.

Our directory services module
         utilizes database applications typically hosted at one of our secure
         data centers to support the storage of and access to digital
         certificates and associated information for a particular customer.
         VeriSign OnSite customers and our affiliates can also download updated
         copies of their directory information to their systems.

Service Control
         Module.

Our service control module is
         hosted at one of our secure data centers and acts as a gatekeeper,
         decoding and routing all digital certificate service requests based on
         customer type, application type, security protocol, authentication
         policies, certificate content and billing rules. This module utilizes
         a proprietary, data-driven programming model to define each service
         and dispatch the appropriate control and error commands to other
         modules.

Digital Certificate
         Processing Module.

Our digital certificate
         processing module is hosted at one of our secure data centers and
         creates digital certificates with digital signatures on each
         certificate, delivers digital certificates to subscribers and stores a
         copy of each digital certificate for archive, audit and directory
         purposes.

Infrastructure

VeriSign believes that its
       highly reliable and scalable operations infrastructure represents a
       strategic advantage in providing Internet-based trust services. Our
       secure data centers are located in Mountain View, California and
       Kawasaki, Japan. Our international affiliates also operate secure data
       centers in their geographic areas. These centers operate on a 24-hour, 7
       days per week basis and support all aspects of our Internet-based trust
       services. VeriSign guarantees that a customer’s services are
       operational on a 24 hour, 7 days per week basis, except for scheduled
       downtime. By leveraging our WorldTrust platform, we can distribute
       certain functionality of our secure data centers in optimum
       configurations based on customer requirements for availability and
       capacity. Key features of our infrastructure include:

Distributed Servers.

We deploy a large number of high-speed
         servers to support capacity and availability demands. We can add
         additional servers to support increases in digital certificate
         volumes, new services introductions, new customers and higher levels
         of redundancy without service interruptions or response time
         degradation. The WorldTrust platform provides automatic fail-over,
         load balancing and threshold monitoring on critical
         servers.

Advanced
         Telecommunications.

We deploy and maintain
         redundant telecommunications and routing hardware and maintain
         high-speed connections to multiple ISPs and throughout our internal
         network to ensure that our mission critical services are readily
         accessible to customers at all times.

Network Security.

We incorporate advanced architectural
         concepts such as protected domains, restricted nodes and distributed
         access control in our system architecture. We have also developed
         proprietary communications protocols within and between the WorldTrust
         platform modules that we believe can prevent most known forms of
         electronic attacks. In addition, we employ the latest network security
         technologies including firewalls and intrusion detection software, and
         contract with security consultants who perform periodic attacks and
         security risk assessments. We will continue to evaluate and deploy new
         technological defenses as they become available. See “Management
         ’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
         Operations—Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations
         —System interruptions and security breaches could harm our
         business.”

Call Center and
         Help Desk.

We provide a wide range of
         customer support services through a phone-based call center, e-mail
         help desk and web-based self-help system. Our call center is staffed
         from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST and employs an automated call director
         system. The web-based support services are available on a 24-hour, 7
         days per week basis, utilizing customized auto response systems to
         provide self-help recommendations and a staff of trained customer
         support agents.

Disaster Recovery
         Plans

.    Although we believe our operations
         facilities are highly resistant to systems failure and sabotage, we
         have developed a disaster recovery and contingency operation plan. We
         also have an agreement with Comdisco Corporation to provide
         replication of customer data, facilities and systems at another site
         so that all of our services can be re-instated within 24 hours of a
         failure. In addition, all of our digital certificate services are
         linked to advanced storage systems that provide data protection
         through techniques such as mirroring and replication. See
         “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         and Results of Operations—Factors That May Affect Future Results
         of Operations—System interruptions and security breaches could
         harm our business.”

International
         Affiliates

.    VeriSign’s international
         affiliates are required to build, implement and maintain their
         infrastructure according to VeriSign’s requirements. VeriSign
         currently has affiliates located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France,
         Germany, Greece/The Balkans, Greece/Cyprus Southeastern Europe,
         Ireland, Japan, Korea, Middle East, Netherlands, Netherlands/Belgium
         and Luxembourg, South Africa (SACA), South Africa/Chile, Uruguay and
         Paraguay, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

Security and
       Trust Practices

VeriSign believes that its
       perceived level of trustworthiness will continue to be a significant
       determining factor in the acceptance of its Internet-based trust
       services. We believe that our reputation as a trusted party is based, to
       a large extent, on both the security of our physical infrastructure and
       the special practices used in our operations, which include our secure
       data centers incorporating state-of-the-art physical and network
       security. We believe we have established a leadership role in defining
       and adhering to industry-endorsed trust practices and policies, a role
       we believe enhances our perceived trustworthiness as a provider of
       Internet-based trust services. Over the past three years, we have
       invested, and continue to invest, capital and human resources in the
       following key areas:

Employees.

We use stringent hiring and personnel management
         practices for all operations and certain engineering personnel as well
         as all executive management. We utilize a licensed private
         investigation firm to conduct background checks into potential
         employees’ criminal and financial histories and conduct periodic
         investigations of such personnel on an ongoing basis.

Security Monitoring
         Systems.

We have sophisticated access
         control and monitoring systems that help prevent unauthorized access
         to secure areas and provide 24 hour, 7 days per week monitoring and
         logging of activities within our facilities. These systems include
         electronic key and biometric access control devices, video monitoring
         and recording devices, deployment and automatic arming of motion
         detectors, glass breakage detectors and remote alarm system
         monitoring.

Site
         Construction.

Our secure data centers have
         been built using construction techniques modeled after U.S. Army
         specifications for facilities accredited to handle classified
         information and contain a robust set of physical and environmental
         defenses. These defenses include double layer, slab-to-slab wall
         design, self-closing and locking metal doors at all secure entrances,
         man traps, tamper proof enclosures for cryptographic materials and
         fire prevention systems.

Back-up Power
         Systems.

We have invested in back-up power
         systems that automatically activate in the event of a failure in our
         primary power sources. These include uninterruptible power supply
         systems and a diesel generator and fuel supply. To ensure reliability,
         these systems are tested on a periodic basis.

Audits.

Our Practices and External Affairs Department
         periodically performs, and retains accredited third parties to
         perform, audits of our operational procedures under both internally
         developed procedures and externally recognized standards.

Practices.

Our Practices and External Affairs Department is
         responsible for the development of VeriSign’s practices for
         issuing and managing digital certificates. These practices are set
         forth in our Certification Practice Statement, which we provide in
         order to assure potential customers and strategic partners as to the
         trustworthiness of our Internet-based trust services. The Practices
         and External Affairs Department is also responsible for our
         accountability and security controls and regularly monitors all
         aspects of our secure data centers.

Policy Making
         Activities.

The Practices and External
         Affairs Department also takes a leading role in a variety of
         organizations that are defining standards for trusted and secure
         electronic commerce and communications over IP networks. For example,
         we actively participate in the United Nations Commission on
         International Trade Law, which created the United Nations Model Law on
         Electronic Commerce, the American Bar Association’s Information
         Security Committee, Section of Science and Technology, which has
         drafted digital signature guidelines, the International Chamber of
         Commerce ETERM Working Party, which is chaired by VeriSign’s Vice
         President of Practices and External Affairs, and the U.S. State
         Department Advisory Committee on Electronic Commerce.

Strategic
       Relationships

VeriSign has established
       strategic relationships with leading companies across a number of
       industry segments. We currently maintain strategic relationships with AT
       &T, BT, Checkpoint, Cisco, Microsoft, Netscape, RSA Security and
       VISA.

British
         Telecommunications.

BT is a member of our
         international affiliate program. BT issues digital certificates and
         provides a range of services for secure Internet access and electronic
         commerce on a co-branded basis. With our support, BT has established
         CA infrastructure in the U.K., including the creation of a secure data
         center that adheres to our site construction specifications. We have
         agreed to collaborate to develop legal practices and policies to
         maintain compliance with U.K. and European-based regulations and
         standards as they emerge.

Cisco.

Our technology is incorporated in Cisco’s
         Internetwork Operating System through the use of the jointly developed
         Certificate Request Syntax (CRS) protocol, which enables digital
         certificate functionality in a variety of Cisco’s networking
         products. As a result, IP networks utilizing Cisco network devices
         such as routers and firewalls support applications that rely on
         VeriSign digital certificates for authentication and network
         management. We also engage in a variety of joint marketing efforts
         with Cisco. Cisco is one of our stockholders.

Microsoft.

We work with Microsoft to develop, promote and
         distribute a variety of client-based and server-based digital
         certificate services and we have been designated as the preferred
         provider of digital certificates for Microsoft customers. Our
         technology has been embedded in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer
         since version 2.0, allowing users to uniquely identify themselves to
         web servers and securely access information over the Internet. In
         addition, users can easily obtain their own digital certificate for
         use with Explorer by registering on our website for our digital
         certificates. We also provide Secure Site Services for Microsoft
         ’s Internet Information Server product. VeriSign’s services
         can be used in conjunction with Microsoft Outlook 98 to enable the
         delivery of secure email in extranet applications. In addition, in
         September 1998, VeriSign and Microsoft announced plans for enhanced
         integration of our digital certificate services with Microsoft
         Exchange Server 5.5. The new capability offers a secure email extranet
         “gateway” service that allows Exchange Server customers to
         issue and manage digital certificates within the global VeriSign Trust
         Network. VeriSign and Microsoft also jointly promote a set of
         technologies and security policies for the secure authentication and
         distribution of software over the Internet and engage in other joint
         marketing activities. Microsoft is one of our
         stockholders.

Netscape.

We work with Netscape on a variety of technology
         projects and joint marketing activities. Our technology has been
         embedded in Netscape’s Navigator since version 1.1 and in Netscape
         ’s Communicator since version 4.0. We also have an agreement with
         Netscape that provides that Netscape feature us as a premier provider
         of digital certificates on the Netscape website and also provides for
         VeriSign to have a first right of participation for any new Netscape
         products incorporating digital certificate technology. Users of
         Netscape browsers can easily enroll for standard VeriSign digital
         certificates using Netscape products. Netscape’s SuiteSpot
         product, including versions with 128-bit encryption capabilities, can
         also utilize our Secure Site and Global Site services. We also support
         Netscape’s object-signing technology, enabling software
         developers to digitally sign Java and JavaScript objects in order to
         authenticate the developer’s identity and assure end users that
         the downloaded objects have not been tampered with or
         modified.

RSA Security.

We have an agreement with RSA Security
         (formerly Security Dynamics) under which RSA Security will incorporate
         custom digital certificate technology developed by VeriSign into RSA
         Security’s future products. RSA Security has also agreed to be a
         reseller of certain VeriSign OEM technology. We believe RSA Security
         is a market leader in enterprise security and that, by including our
         technology in RSA Security’s products, we will have a broader
         potential market for our digital certificate services. RSA Security,
         through a controlled entity, holds approximately 5% of our common
         stock.

VISA.

We have an agreement with VISA under which we
         provide SET digital certificate services to VISA on behalf of its
         member banks, enabling them to offer branded SET-compliant digital
         certificates to their cardholders and merchants.

Marketing,
       Sales and Distribution

Marketing

VeriSign utilizes a variety of
       marketing programs to increase brand awareness. In addition to joint
       marketing arrangements, we also engage in a variety of direct marketing
       programs and public relations campaigns focused on owners of web
       servers, home and business PC users and enterprise professionals. We
       address these customers through outbound e-mail, telemarketing and
       printed mail campaigns to stimulate product trial, purchase and usage.
       We also use banner ads and text links that connect to our website and
       participate in industry-specific events, trade shows, executive
       seminars, industry association activities and various national and
       international standards bodies. We have 48 employees engaged in
       marketing activities.

Sales and
         Distribution

VeriSign markets its
       Internet-based trust services worldwide through multiple distribution
       channels. These sales and service groups are based in our headquarters
       in Mountain View, California, and in several field offices in the United
       States as well as internationally. We also market our Internet-based
       trust services through other distribution channels, including telesales,
       VARs, systems integrators and our affiliates.

Outside the United States,
       VeriSign markets its Internet-based trust services directly over the
       Internet and through reseller and affiliate relationships—the
       global VeriSign Trust Network. Except for VeriSign Japan, the members of
       the global VeriSign Trust Network sell and support VeriSign
       Internet-based trust services both within their local countries and
       certain other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct
       sales subsidiary. In Japan, we market our Internet-based trust services
       through VeriSign Japan, which maintains a secure data center in
       Kawasaki, Japan, and employed 28 persons as of December 31, 1999.
       Revenues from VeriSign Japan and other international customers were 27%
       of total revenues in 1999, 14% in 1998 and less than 10% in
       1997.

Internet Sales.

VeriSign distributes many of its
         Internet-based trust services through its website. We believe that
         Internet distribution is particularly well suited for sales of certain
         of our website authentication products and Internet-based trust
         services. We also use our website to assist in disseminating services
         information and in generating services trials.

Direct Sales.

VeriSign’s direct sales force targets
         mid-sized and large corporations, financial institutions, commercial
         websites, electronic commerce providers and federal and state
         government agencies. We believe that these organizations have a
         substantial installed base of PCs, web servers, IP networks and
         high-speed access to the Internet and are most likely to be able to
         benefit quickly from the use of digital certificates. The direct sales
         force also targets international organizations that we believe are the
         most suitable to act as VeriSign affiliates. As of December 31, 1999,
         we had 70 sales and sales support employees in the United States,
         while the international direct sales and sales support groups
         consisted of 15 employees.

Telesales.

VeriSign’s internal telemarketing operation is
         responsible for customer prospecting, lead generation and lead
         follow-up. This marketing activity qualifies leads for further follow
         up by the direct
       sales force or inside sales team or leads the prospect to our website so
         that the prospect can access information and enroll for our
         Internet-based trust services.

VARs and Systems
         Integrators.

VeriSign works with VARs and
         systems integrators to package and sell its Internet-based trust
         services. We also have a VeriSign Business Partner Program that allows
         ISPs and web hosting companies to offer Secure Site services as an
         integral part of their secure web hosting services.

Research and
       Development

We believe that our future
       success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain
       and enhance our current technologies and Internet-based trust services.
       To this end, we leverage the modular nature of our WorldTrust platform
       to enable us to develop enhancements rapidly and to deliver
       complementary new Internet-based trust services. In the past, we have
       developed Internet-based trust services both independently and through
       efforts with leading application developers and major customers. We have
       also, in certain circumstances, acquired or licensed technology from
       third parties, including public key cryptography technology from RSA.
       Although we will continue to work closely with developers and major
       customers in our development efforts, we expect that most of our future
       enhancements to existing services and new Internet-based trust services
       will be developed internally.

As of December 31, 1999,
       VeriSign had 91 employees dedicated to research and development. We also
       employ independent contractors for documentation, usability, artistic
       design and editorial review. Research and development expenses were
       $13.3 million in 1999, $8.4 million in 1998 and $5.3 million in 1997. To
       date, all development costs have been expensed as incurred. We believe
       that timely development of new and enhanced Internet-based trust
       services and technology are necessary to remain competitive in the
       marketplace. Accordingly, VeriSign intends to continue recruiting and
       hiring experienced research and development personnel and to make other
       investments in research and development.

The market for Internet-based
       trust services is an emerging market characterized by rapid
       technological developments, frequent new product introductions and
       evolving industry standards. The emerging nature of this market and its
       rapid evolution will require that we continually improve the
       performance, features and reliability of our Internet-based trust
       services, particularly in response to competitive offerings and that we
       introduce both new and enhanced Internet-based trust services as quickly
       as possible and prior to our competitors. The success of new
       introductions is dependent on several factors, including proper new
       definition, timely completion and introduction of new services,
       differentiation of new services from those of our competitors and market
       acceptance of our new Internet-based trust services. There can be no
       assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new
       Internet-based trust services that respond to competitive and
       technological developments and changing customer needs.

Our failure to develop and
       introduce new Internet-based trust services successfully on a timely
       basis and to achieve market acceptance for such Internet-based trust
       services could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
       results and financial condition. In addition, the widespread adoption of
       new Internet, networking or telecommunication technologies or standards
       or other technological changes could require that we make substantial
       expenditures to modify or adapt our Internet-based trust services. To
       the extent that a specific method other than digital certificates is
       adopted to enable trusted and secure electronic commerce and
       communications over wireless and wired IP networks, sales of VeriSign
       ’s existing and planned Internet-based trust services would be
       adversely affected and our Internet-based trust services could be
       rendered unmarketable or obsolete, which would have a material adverse
       effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We
       believe that there is a time-limited opportunity to achieve market
       share. We may not be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of
       our Internet-based trust services or in achieving market share before
       competitors offer products and services with features similar to our
       current offerings. Any such failure by us could materially harm our
       business.

Customer
       Support

We believe that a high level
       of customer support for customers as well as end users of digital
       certificates is necessary to achieve acceptance of our Internet-based
       trust services. We provide a wide range of customer support services
       through a staff of customer service personnel, call center, e-mail help
       desk and a web-based self-help system. Since we first introduced our
       Internet-based trust services over three years ago, we have developed a
       substantial knowledge base of customer support information based on our
       customer interactions and we believe that this offers us a competitive
       advantage. Our call center is staffed from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST and
       employs an automated call director system to provide self-help services
       and, if necessary, to route support calls to available support
       personnel. We also offer web-based support services that are available
       on a 24-hour, 7 days per week basis and that are frequently updated to
       improve existing information and to support new services. Our e-mail
       customer support service utilizes customized auto response systems to
       provide self-help recommendations and also utilizes a staff of trained
       customer support agents who typically respond to customer inquiries
       within 24 hours. As of December 31, 1999, we had 75 employees in our
       customer support organization.

We also employ technical
       support personnel who work directly with our direct sales force,
       distributors and customers of our Website and Enterprise Digital
       Certificate Services. Our annual maintenance agreements for our Website
       and Enterprise Digital Certificate Services include technical support
       and upgrades. We also provide training programs for enterprise customers
       of our Internet-based trust services. As of December 31, 1999, we had 46
       employees in our professional services organization.

Competition

Our Internet-based trust
       services are targeted at the new and rapidly evolving market for trusted
       services, including authentication, validation and payment, that enable
       secure electronic commerce and communications over wired and wireless IP
       networks. Although the competitive environment in this market has yet to
       develop fully, we anticipate that it will be intensely competitive,
       subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and
       service introductions and other market activities of industry
       participants.

Our principal competitors
       generally fall within one of three categories: (1) companies such as
       Baltimore Technologies, Certicom Corp., Diversinet Corp. and Entrust
       Technologies which offer software applications and related digital
       certificate products that customers operate themselves; (2) companies
       such as Digital Signature Trust Company (a subsidiary of Zions
       Bancorporation) that primarily offer digital certificate and CA related
       services; and (3) companies focused on providing a bundled offering of
       products and services such as GTE CyberTrust (recently acquired by
       Baltimore Technologies) and IBM (working jointly with Equifax). We also
       experience competition from a number of smaller companies, and we
       believe that our primary long-term competitors may not yet have entered
       the market. Netscape and Microsoft have introduced software products
       that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates, and we
       believe that other companies could introduce such products. Additional
       companies could offer digital certificate solutions that are competitive
       with ours.

Several of our current and
       potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly
       greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do
       and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or
       changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer
       requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and more
       established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing
       products or services directly to customers through bundling or other
       means. If such competitors were to bundle competing products or services
       for their customers, the demand for our products and services might be
       substantially reduced and our ability to distribute our products
       successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially
       diminished. In addition, browser companies that embed our interface
       technologies or otherwise feature VeriSign as a provider of digital
       certificate solutions in their web browsers or on their websites could
       also promote our competitors or charge VeriSign substantial fees for such
     promotions in the future. New technologies and the expansion of existing
       technologies may increase the competitive pressures on us. There can be
       no assurance that competing technologies developed by others or the
       emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our
       competitive position or render our Internet-based trust services or
       technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, the market for
       digital certificates is nascent and is characterized by announcements of
       collaborative relationships involving our competitors. The existence or
       announcement of such relationships could adversely affect our ability to
       attract and retain customers. As a result of the foregoing and other
       factors, we may not be able to compete effectively with current or
       future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could
       materially harm our business.

In connection with our first
       round of financing, RSA contributed certain technology to us and entered
       into a non-competition agreement with us pursuant to which RSA agreed
       that it would not compete with our CA business for a period of five
       years. This non-competition agreement will expire in April 2000. We
       believe that, because RSA, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSA
       Security, has already developed expertise in the area of cryptography,
       its barriers to entry would be lower than those that would be
       encountered by our other potential competitors should it choose to enter
       any of our markets. If RSA were to enter into the digital certificate
       market, our business could be materially harmed.

Government
       Regulation

Exports of software products
       utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the U.S. and
       various non-U.S. governments. Although we have obtained U.S. government
       approval to export our Global Server digital certificates and none of
       our other Internet-based trust services are currently subject to export
       controls under U.S. law, the list of products and countries for which
       export approval is required could be revised in the future to include
       more digital certificate products and related services. If we do not
       obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell certain
       Internet-based trust services in international markets.

There are currently no federal
       laws or regulations that specifically control CAs, but a limited number
       of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to CAs.
       If the market for digital certificates grows, the U.S. federal or state
       or non-U.S. governments may choose to enact further regulations
       governing CAs or other providers of digital certificate products and
       related services. Such regulations or the costs of complying with such
       regulations could harm our business.

Many companies conducting
       electronic commerce over IP networks do not collect sales or other
       similar taxes with respect to shipments of goods into other states or
       foreign countries or with respect to other transactions conducted
       between parties in different states or countries. It is possible that
       the U.S. federal or state or non-U.S. governments may seek to impose
       sales taxes on companies that engage in electronic commerce over IP
       networks. In the event that government bodies succeed in imposing sales
       or other taxes on electronic commerce, the growth of the use of IP
       networks for electronic commerce could slow substantially, which could
       materially harm our business.

Due to the increasing
       popularity of IP networks, it is possible that domestic or foreign laws
       and regulations may be enacted covering issues such as user privacy,
       pricing, content and quality of products and services. The increased
       attention focused upon these issues as a result of the adoption of other
       laws or regulations may reduce the rate of growth of IP networks, which
       in turn could result in decreased demand for our Internet-based trust
       services or could otherwise materially harm our business.

Intellectual
       Property

We rely primarily on a
       combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws,
       restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual
       property and trade secrets. We also enter into confidentiality
       agreements with our employees, consultants and current and potential
       affiliates, customers and business partners. We also generally control
       access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary
       information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third
       party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or
       trade secrets without authorization. In addition, there can be no
     assurance that others will not independently develop substantially
       equivalent intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the
       precautions we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our
       technology. We have also filed five applications for patents with
       respect to certain of our technology. However, the U.S. Patent and
       Trademark Office may not award any patents with respect to these
       applications. Even if patents are issued, they may not adequately
       protect this technology from infringement or prevent others from
       claiming our technology infringes that of third parties. Our failure to
       protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner could
       materially harm our business. In addition, litigation may be necessary
       in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect
       our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the
       proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in
       substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources,
       either of which could materially harm our business.

We also rely on certain
       licensed third-party technology, such as public key cryptography
       technology licensed from RSA and other technology that is used in our
       Internet-based trust services to perform key functions. In particular,
       RSA has granted VeriSign a perpetual, royalty free, nonexclusive,
       worldwide license to distribute Internet-based trust services we develop
       that contain or incorporate the RSA BSAFE and TIPEM products and that
       relate to digital certificate issuing software, software for the
       management of private keys and for digitally signing computer files on
       behalf of others, software for customers to preview and forward digital
       certificate requests to us, or such other services that, in RSA’s
       reasonable discretion, are reasonably necessary for the implementation
       of a digital certificate business. Our agreement with RSA also requires
       RSA to provide us maintenance and technical support for these services.
       RSA’s BSAFE product is a software tool kit that allows for the
       integration of encryption and authentication features into software
       applications. TIPEM is a secure e-mail development tool kit that allows
       for secure e-mail messages to be sent using one vendor’s e-mail
       product and read by another vendor’s e-mail product. These
       third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to
       VeriSign on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of any of
       these technologies could materially harm our business. Moreover, in our
       current license agreements, the licensor has agreed to defend, indemnify
       and hold VeriSign harmless with respect to any claim by a third party
       that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary
       right. Although these licenses are fully paid, there can be no assurance
       that the outcome of any litigation between the licensor and a third
       party or between VeriSign and a third party will not lead to obligations
       for us to pay royalties for which we are not indemnified or for which
       such indemnification is insufficient, or that we will be able to obtain
       any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In
       the future, we may seek to license additional technology to incorporate
       in our Internet-based trust services. Third party technology licenses
       that we may need to obtain in the future may not be available to us on
       commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of or inability to
       obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could result in
       delays in introduction of our Internet-based trust services until
       equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and
       integrated. This could materially harm our business.

From time to time, we have
       received, and may receive in the future, notice of claims of
       infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights. Infringement or
       other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future,
       and it is possible that past or future assertions or prosecutions could
       harm our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be
       time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical
       and management personnel, cause delays in the release of new
       Internet-based trust services or require us to develop non-infringing
       technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty
       or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms
       acceptable to us, or at all. In the event of a successful claim of
       infringement against VeriSign and our failure or inability to develop
       non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology
       on a timely basis, our business could be materially harmed. See
       “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
       and Results of Operations—Factors That May Affect Future Results
       —There are Risks Related to Intellectual Property Rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 1999,
       VeriSign had 394 full-time employees. Of the total, 128 were employed in
       sales and marketing, 91 in research and development, 121 in customer
       support, 5 in practices and external
     affairs, and 49 in finance and administration, including information
       services personnel. We have never had a work stoppage, and no employees
       are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider our
       relations with our employees to be good. Our ability to achieve our
       financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our
       continued ability to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate
       highly qualified sales, technical and managerial personnel, and upon the
       continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical
       personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Competition
       for such qualified personnel in our industry and geographical location
       in the San Francisco Bay Area is intense, particularly in software
       development and product management personnel.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

VeriSign’s principal
       administrative, sales, marketing, research and development and
       operations facilities are located in two buildings in Mountain View,
       California, where we occupy approximately 74,000 square feet under
       leases that expire in 2005. We believe that our office space will be
       adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.

VeriSign also leases space for
       sales and support offices in Norcross, Georgia; Rosemont, Illinois;
       Linthicum, Maryland; Wakefield, Massachusetts; Novi, Michigan;
       Uniondale, New York; and Irving, Texas. In addition, we lease space in
       Kawasaki, Japan for our offices and secure data center and we lease
       space for a sales and support office in Upplands Vasby, Sweden. Our
       success is largely dependent on the uninterrupted operation of our
       secure data centers and computer and communications systems. See
       “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
       and Results of Operations—Factors That May Affect Future Results of
       Operations—System interruptions and security breaches could harm

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER
       MATTERS

VeriSign’s common stock
       has been traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol “VRSN
       ” since January 29, 1998, the date of our initial public offering.
       Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. The
       following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low
       closing prices for our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq National
       Market as adjusted for two-for one stock splits on May 29, 1999 and
       December 6, 1999.

On January 31, 2000, there
       were 337 holders of record of our common stock although we believe there
       are in excess of 67,000 beneficial owners.

The market price of our common
       stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the
       future. In addition, the market prices of securities of other technology
       companies, particularly Internet-related companies, have been highly
       volatile. Factors that may have a significant effect on the market price
       of our common stock include:

Ÿ

fluctuations in
         our operating results;

Ÿ

announcements
         of technological innovations or new Internet-based trust services by
         us or new products or services by our competitors;

Ÿ

analysts’
         reports and projections;

Ÿ

regulatory
         actions; and

Ÿ

general market,
         economic or political conditions in the U.S. or abroad.

We have never declared or paid
       any cash dividends on our common stock or other securities and we do not
       anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following selected
       consolidated financial data are derived from VeriSign’s
       consolidated financial statements and are restated to reflect our
       acquisition of SecureIT, Inc. in 1998 in a transaction accounted for as
       a pooling-of-interests. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
       Statements. This data should be read in conjunction with the
       consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and with Item 7,
       Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
       Results of Operations.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
       RESULTS

OF
       OPERATIONS

You should read the
       following discussion in conjunction with VeriSign’s consolidated
       financial statements and notes thereto.

Overview

VeriSign is the leading
       provider of Internet trust services, including authentication,
       validation and payment services, needed by websites, enterprises and
       individuals to conduct trusted and secure electronic commerce and
       communications over IP networks. We have established strategic
       relationships with industry leaders, including BT, Cisco, Microsoft,
       Netscape, Network Associates, Network Solutions, RSA Security and VISA,
       to enable widespread utilization of our digital certificate services and
       to assure interoperability with a wide variety of applications and
       network equipment. We have used our secure online infrastructure to sell
       over 215,000 of our website digital certificates to date. In addition,
       we have issued over 4.0 million of our digital certificates for
       individuals. Our website certificates currently protect the websites of
       a predominant number of leading online merchants, global financial
       institutions, Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. We also
       offer VeriSign OnSite, a managed service that allows an organization to
       leverage our trusted data processing infrastructure to develop and
       deploy customized digital certificate services for use by employees,
       customers and business partners. Since its introduction in November
       1997, we have sold over 800 OnSite service solutions to enterprises. We
       have also begun to build an international network of affiliates who
       provide our trust services under licensed co-branding relationships
       using our proprietary technology and business practices. We currently
     have affiliate relationships with over 20 organizations including
       Arabtrust in the Middle East, BT in the United Kingdom, CIBC of Canada,
       CertiSur of Argentina, Certplus of France, eSign of Australia, HiTrust
       of Taiwan, KPN Telecom of The Netherlands, Roccade of The Netherlands,
       the South African Certification Agency in South Africa, and Telia in
       Sweden.

We have derived substantially
       all of our revenues to date from fees for services rendered in
       connection with deploying Internet trust services. Revenues from these
       trust services consist of fees for the issuance of digital certificates,
       fees for digital certificate service provisioning, fees for technology
       and business process licensing to affiliates and fees for consulting,
       implementation, training, support and maintenance services. Each of
       these sources of revenue has different revenue recognition methods. We
       defer revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates and
       recognize these revenues ratably over the life of the digital
       certificate, generally 12 months. We defer revenues from the sale of our
       OnSite managed services and recognize these revenues ratably over the
       term of the license, generally 12 months. We recognize revenues from the
       sale of digital certificate technology and business process licensing to
       affiliates upon delivery of the technology and signing of an agreement,
       provided the fee is fixed and determinable, collectibility is probable
       and the arrangement does not require significant production,
       modification or customization of the software. We recognize revenues
       from consulting and training services using the percentage-of-completion
       method for fixed-fee development arrangements or as the services are
       provided for time-and-materials arrangements. We recognize revenues
       ratably over the term of the agreement for support and maintenance
       services.

We market our Internet trust
       services worldwide through multiple distribution channels, including the
       Internet, direct sales, telesales, value added resellers, systems
       integrators and our international affiliates. A significant portion of
       our revenues to date has been generated through sales from our website,
       but we intend to continue increasing our direct sales force, both in the
       United States and abroad, and to continue to expand our other
       distribution channels.

In connection with the
       formation of VeriSign Japan, we licensed technology and contributed
       other assets to VeriSign Japan. Subsequent to its formation, additional
       investors purchased minority interests in VeriSign Japan. As of December
       31, 1999, we owned 50.5% of the outstanding capital stock of VeriSign
       Japan. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements include the
       accounts of VeriSign Japan and our consolidated statements of operations
       reflect the minority shareholders’ share of the net losses of
       VeriSign Japan.

VeriSign completed a merger
       with SecureIT, Inc. (“SecureIT”) in July 1998. SecureIT is a
       provider of Internet and enterprise security solutions comprising a full
       range of products and services to assist clients with assessing,
       designing and implementing security solutions. The merger was effected
       by exchanging approximately 6,664,000 shares of VeriSign common stock
       for all of the outstanding common stock of SecureIT. Each share of
       SecureIT was exchanged for 0.164806 of one share of VeriSign common
       stock. In addition, outstanding SecureIT employee stock options were
       converted at the same exchange ratio into options to purchase
       approximately 760,000 shares of VeriSign common stock. The merger
       constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for as a
       pooling-of-interests.

In December 1999, we announced
       that we would acquire Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. (“Thawte”),
       a privately held South African company that provides digital
       certificates to websites and software developers. We completed this
       acquisition on February 2000 and issued approximately 4.4 million shares
       of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
       Thawte. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and,
       accordingly, the results of Thawte’s operations will be included in
       our consolidated financial statements from the date of
       acquisition.

Also in December 1999, we
       announced that we would acquire Signio, Inc. (“Signio”), a
       privately held company that provides payment services that connect
       online merchants, business-to-business exchanges, payment processors and
       financial institutions on the Internet. We completed this acquisition on
       February 2000 and issued approximately 5.6 million shares of our common
       stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Signio and we
       also assumed Signio’s outstanding employee stock options. The
       transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.

We announced in March 2000,
       that we would acquire Network Solutions, Inc. (“Network Solutions
       ”), a publicly held company that provides Internet domain name
       registration and global registry services. Based on the completion of a
       2-for-1 stock split of Network Solution’s common stock on March 10,
       2000, we will issue 1.075 shares of our common stock in exchange for all
       the outstanding shares of Network Solutions. In addition, any options or
       warrants to purchase Network Solutions capital stock will be exchanged,
       as applicable, to purchase VeriSign common stock according to the
       exchange ratio. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase. The
       acquisition is subject to customary conditions of closing including
       approval by both the VeriSign and Network Solutions
       stockholders.

As a result of our
       acquisitions of Thawte and Signio, we expect to record goodwill and
       other intangible assets of approximately $2 billion. These amounts will
       be amortized over a two to three year period, which will adversely
       affect our results of operations. If we complete our proposed
       acquisition of Network Solutions, we expect to record additional
       substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets. We expect
       this amount may range from $18 billion to $20 billion. Therefore, we
       will experience net losses as we incur charges relating to these
       assets.

We have experienced
       substantial operating losses in each fiscal period since our inception,
       except for the fourth quarter of 1999. As of December 31, 1999, we had
       an accumulated deficit of $47.5 million. These operating losses and
       accumulated deficit resulted from the significant costs incurred in the
       development and sale of our Internet trust services and in the
       establishment and deployment of our technology, infrastructure and
       practices. Although our revenues have grown in recent periods, we may be
       unable to sustain this growth. Therefore, you should not consider our
       historical growth indicative of future revenue levels or operating
       results. In addition, although we achieved an operating profit during
       the quarter ended December 31, 1999, we may not be able to sustain
       profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. A more
       complete description of these and other risks relating to our business
       is set forth under the caption “Factors That May Affect Future
       Results of Operations.”

Revenues increased
       significantly in 1999 from 1998 and 1997 due to higher sales of our
       Internet-based trust services, particularly our website digital
       certificates, affiliate processing and service centers, VeriSign OnSite
       services, and the delivery of more training and services. In addition,
       in 1999, we expanded our international affiliate network and experienced
       significant growth in international markets. In 1998, we completed
       certain work required under various consulting contracts and recognized
       the related portion of revenues. We have had no significant increases in
       our per-unit prices since the third quarter of 1997,when we increased
       our per-unit prices for digital certificates by approximately
       15%.

No customer accounted for 10%
       or more of revenues in 1999 or 1998. VISA International accounted for
       approximately 10% of our revenues in 1997. Revenues of VeriSign Japan
       and revenues from other international customers accounted for 27% of
       total revenues in 1999, 14% in 1998 and less than 10% in
       1997.

       and issuance services, customer support and training, consulting and
       development services and costs of facilities and computer equipment used
       in these activities. Cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third
       parties to verify certificate applicants’ identities, insurance
       premiums for our service warranty plan and errors and omission insurance
       and the cost of software resold to customers.

Growth of revenues was the
       primary factor in the increase of cost of revenues in 1999 from 1998 and
       in 1998 from 1997. We hired more employees to support the growth of
       demand for our products and services during the period and to support
       the growth of our security consulting and training activities. The cost
       of insurance premiums for our service warranty plan increased because of
       greater certificate volume as well as because this plan was not in
       effect for a portion of 1997. In addition, we incurred increased
       expenses for access to third-party databases, higher support charges for
       our external disaster recovery program and increased expenses related to
       the cost of software products resold to customers as part of network
       security solution implementations.

Cost of revenues as a
       percentage of revenues decreased in 1999 from 1998 and in 1998 from 1997
       primarily due to the overall increase in revenues, the continued
       realization of economies of scale from our technology infrastructure and
       the efficiency gains in the certificate enrollment and issuance
       process.

Certain of our services, such
       as implementation consulting and training, require greater initial
       personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types
       of services. As a result, we anticipate that cost of revenues will vary
       in future periods depending on the mix of services sold.

Sales and
         marketing

Sales and marketing expenses
       consist primarily of costs related to sales, marketing, practices and
       external affair activities. These expenses include salaries, sales
       commissions and other personnel-related expenses, travel and related
       expenses, costs of computer and communications equipment and support
       services, facilities costs, consulting fees and costs of marketing
       programs.

Sales and marketing expenses
       increased in 1999 from 1998 and in 1998 from 1997 as a result of the
       continued growth of our direct sales force and the expansion of our
       marketing efforts, particularly in lead and demand generation
       activities. The expansion of our international sales presence in Europe
       during the second half of 1999 also contributed to the increase from
       1998. The increase in 1998 from 1997 was also caused by the expansion of
       the sales and marketing organization related to our security consulting
       and training services. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of
       revenues decreased in each year primarily due to the greater revenue
       base as well as the increase in recurring revenue from existing
       customers, which tend to have lower acquisition costs associated with
       them. In addition, the productivity of our direct sales force increased,
       as did the effectiveness of our marketing lead and demand generation
       activities.

We anticipate that sales and
       marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we
       expand our direct sales force and increase our marketing and demand
       generation activities both in the United States and
       internationally.

Research
         and development

Research and development
       expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development
       personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related expenses,
       consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and communications
       equipment and support services used in service and technology
       development.

Research and development
       expenses increased in absolute dollars in each year as we invested in
       the design, testing and deployment of, and technical support for, our
       expanded Internet trust service offerings and technology. The increase
       reflects the expansion of our engineering staff and related costs
       required to support our continued emphasis on developing new products
       and services as well as enhancing existing products and services. During
       1999, we continued to make significant investments in development of all
       of our services. The decrease in research and development expenses as a
       percentage of revenues in 1999 from 1998 and in 1998 from 1997 is
       primarily due to the fact that revenues increased faster than research
       and development expenses in these periods.

We believe that timely
       development of new and enhanced Internet trust services and technology
       are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace. Accordingly, we
       intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development
       personnel and to make other investments in research and development. As
       a result, we expect research and development expenses will continue to
       increase in absolute dollars. To date, we have expensed all research and
       development expenditures as incurred.

General and
         administrative

General and administrative
       expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related
       expenses for our administrative, finance and human relations personnel,
       facilities and computer and communications equipment, support services
       and professional services fees.

Our expenses increased in 1999
       from 1998 and in 1998 from 1997 primarily due to the increased staffing
       levels required to manage and support our expanded operations, the
       implementation of additional management information systems and related
       procedures, and the expansion of our corporate headquarters. The
       decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
       revenues in these years is primarily due to the fact that revenues
       increased faster than general and administrative expenses as we began to
       experience economies of scale in our corporate
       infrastructure.

We expect to continue to
       invest in a more comprehensive executive and administrative
       infrastructure, including upgrading to more robust information systems.
       As a result, we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will
       increase in absolute dollars.

Special
         charges

In connection with our
       acquisition of SecureIT, we recorded a special charge of $3.6 million to
       operating expenses in the third quarter of 1998. The expenses included
       $2.4 million for direct and other merger-related costs pertaining to the
       merger transaction. Merger transaction costs consisted primarily of fees
       for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, filing fees and other
       related charges. The remaining $1.2 million related to stock-based
       compensation charges in connection with the acceleration of certain
       performance stock options held by SecureIT employees.

In September 1996, VeriFone,
       Inc., which subsequently became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
       Hewlett-Packard, filed a lawsuit against VeriSign alleging, among other
       things, trademark infringement. In November 1997, VeriSign,
       Hewlett-Packard and VeriFone reached an agreement, under which, among
       other things, we issued 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, which were
       transferred to Hewlett-Packard, and VeriSign and VeriFone settled all
       claims. The settlement amount was recorded in the third quarter of 1997
       as a $2.0 million charge to operations.

In November 1997, we entered
       into a preferred provider agreement with Microsoft whereby we agreed to
       jointly develop, promote and distribute a variety of client-based and
       server-based digital certificate solutions. Under this agreement, we
       have been designated as the premier provider of digital certificates for
       Microsoft customers. In connection with the agreement, we issued 400,000
       shares of our common stock to Microsoft and recorded an $800,000 charge
       to operations.

Interest
         Income

Interest income consists
       primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and
       short-term investments.

The increase in interest
       income in 1999 from 1998 and in 1998 from 1997 is primarily due to a
       higher average cash and short-term investment base as a result of our
       offerings of our common stock to the public in January 1999 and January
       1998.

Other
         Expense, Net

Other expense, net consists of
       interest expense on bank borrowings of VeriSign Japan, the effect of
       foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains or losses on the
       disposal of property and equipment and other miscellaneous
       expenses.

The increase in other expense,
       net, is substantially due to higher losses on disposals of assets and an
       increase in miscellaneous expenses.

Provision
         for Income Tax

We have not recorded any
       provision for federal and California income taxes because we have
       experienced an accumulated deficit since inception. As of December 31,
       1999, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
       $127.4 million and California net operating loss carryforwards of
       approximately $64.5 million. If we are not able to use them, the federal
       net operating loss carryforwards will
     expire in 2010 through 2019 and the state net operating loss carryforwards
       will expire in 2004. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial
       restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits
       in the event of a corporation’s ownership change, as defined in the
       Internal Revenue Code. Our ability to utilize net operating loss
       carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership change. We do
       not anticipate that any material limitation exists on our ability to use
       our carryforwards and credits.

We have recognized
       approximately $46 million of deferred tax assets during 1999 to offset a
       deferred tax liability of an equal amount, which arose as a result of
       the comprehensive income arising from the unrealized gain on our
       investment in Keynote Systems. Approximately $29 million of this offset
       related to deferred tax assets, which resulted from stock option
       exercises. Accordingly, a $29 million charge in lieu of taxes was
       charged to comprehensive income, with an offsetting credit to additional
       paid in capital.

We have provided a full
       valuation allowance on the remaining deferred tax asset because of the
       uncertainty regarding its realization. Our accounting for deferred taxes
       under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
       “Accounting for Income Taxes

,

” involves the evaluation
       of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax
       assets. In concluding that a full valuation allowance was required, we
       considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected
       future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets. Although our
       operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods,
       our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the
       realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were
       not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence.
       All of the remaining valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets,
       which arose as the result of stock option exercises. Accordingly, the
       reversal of the remaining valuation allowance will result in a credit to
       additional paid in capital and will not result in a future income
       statement benefit. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
       Statements.

Minority
         Interest in Net Loss of Subsidiary

Minority interest in the net
       losses of VeriSign Japan K.K. was $.8 million in 1999, $1.3 million in
       1998 and $1.5 million in 1997. The year-to-year decreases are primarily
       due to VeriSign Japan’s increased revenue as compared to the prior
       years. As the VeriSign Japan business continues to develop and evolve,
       we expect that the minority interest in net loss of subsidiary will
       fluctuate in future periods.

Factors That
       May Affect Future Results of Operations

Our business
         depends on the adoption and continued use of IP
         networks.

In order for VeriSign to be
       successful, IP networks must be widely adopted, in a timely manner, as a
       means of trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications.
       Because electronic commerce and communications over IP networks are new
       and evolving, it is difficult to predict the size of this market and its
       sustainable growth rate. To date, many businesses and consumers have
       been deterred from utilizing IP networks for a number of reasons,
       including, but not limited to:

Ÿ

potentially
         inadequate development of network infrastructure;

Ÿ

security
         concerns including the potential for merchant or user impersonation
         and fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over IP
         networks;

Ÿ

other security
         concerns such as attacks on popular websites by “hackers;
         ”

Ÿ

inconsistent
         quality of service;

Ÿ

lack of
         availability of cost-effective, high-speed service;

Ÿ

limited numbers
         of local access points for corporate users;

Ÿ

inability to
         integrate business applications on IP networks;

Ÿ

the need to
         operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products;
         and

Ÿ

a lack of tools
         to simplify access to and use of IP networks.

The adoption of IP networks
       will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business
       and exchanging information. Organizations that already have invested
       substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be
       reluctant to adopt new methods. Also, individuals with established
       patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting payments may be
       reluctant to change.

The use of IP networks may not
       increase or may increase more slowly than we expect because the
       infrastructure required to support widespread use might not develop. The
       Internet may continue to experience significant growth both in the
       number of users and the level of use. However, the Internet
       infrastructure may not be able to continue to support the demands placed
       on it by continued growth. Continued growth may also affect the Internet
       ’s performance and reliability. In addition, the growth and
       reliability of IP networks could be harmed by delays in development or
       adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of
       activity or by increased governmental regulation. Changes in, or
       insufficient availability of, communications services to support IP
       networks could result in poor performance and also adversely affect
       their level of usage. Any of these factors could materially harm our
       business. See “Business—Customers and Markets.
       ”

Our market
         is new and evolving.

We target our Internet-based
       trust services at the market for trusted and secure electronic commerce
       and communications over IP networks. This is a new and rapidly evolving
       market that may not continue to grow. Accordingly, the demand for our
       Internet-based trust services is very uncertain. Even if the market for
       electronic commerce and communications over IP networks grows, our
       Internet-based trust services may not be widely accepted. The factors
       that may affect the level of market acceptance of digital certificates
       and, consequently, our Internet-based trust services include the
       following:

Ÿ

market
         acceptance of products and services based upon authentication
         technologies other than those we use;

Ÿ

public
         perception of the security of digital certificates and IP
         networks;

Ÿ

the ability of
         the Internet infrastructure to accommodate increased levels of usage;
         and

Ÿ

government
         regulations affecting electronic commerce and communications over IP
         networks.

Even if digital certificates
       achieve market acceptance, our Internet-based trust services may fail to
       address the market’s requirements adequately. If digital
       certificates do not achieve market acceptance in a timely manner and
       sustain such acceptance, or if our Internet-based trust services in
       particular do not achieve or sustain market acceptance, our business
       would be materially harmed. See “Business—Customers and
       Markets.”

System
         interruptions and security breaches could harm our
         business.

We depend on the uninterrupted
       operation of our secure data centers and our other computer and
       communications systems. We must protect these systems from loss, damage
       or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, power loss,
       telecommunications failure or other events beyond our control. Most of
       our systems are located at, and most of our customer information is
       stored in, our facilities in Mountain View, California and Kawasaki,
       Japan, areas susceptible to earthquakes. Any damage or failure that
       causes interruptions in our secure data centers and our other computer
       and communications systems could materially harm our business. In
       addition, our ability to issue digital certificates depends on the
       efficient operation of the Internet connections from customers to our
       secure data centers. Such connections depend upon efficient operation of
       web browsers, Internet service providers and Internet backbone service
       providers, all of which have had periodic operational problems or
       experienced outages in the past. Any of these problems or outages could
       adversely affect customer satisfaction.

Our success also depends
       upon the scalability of our systems. Our systems have not been tested at
       the volumes that may be required in the future. Thus, it is possible
       that a substantial increase in demand for our Internet-based trust
       services could cause interruptions in our systems. Any such
       interruptions could adversely affect our ability to deliver our
       Internet-based trust services and therefore could materially harm our
       business.

Although we periodically
       perform, and retain accredited third parties to perform, audits of our
       operational practices and procedures, we may not be able to remain in
       compliance with our internal standards or those set by third-party
       auditors. If we fail to maintain these standards, we may have to expend
       significant time and money to return to compliance and our business
       could be materially harmed.

We retain certain confidential
       customer information in our secure data centers. It is critical to our
       business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure
       and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Despite our security
       measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins,
       computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems. It
       is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other
       resources to address such problems. Any physical or electronic break-ins
       or other security breaches or compromises of the information stored at
       our secure data centers may jeopardize the security of information
       stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our
       customers. In such an event, we could face significant liability and
       customers could be reluctant to use our Internet-based trust services.
       Such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore
       adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of
       electronic commerce and communications over IP networks as well as of
       the security or reliability of our services. See “Business
       —Infrastructure” and “—Security and Trust Practices
       ” and “Properties.”

We have a
         limited operating history.

VeriSign was incorporated in
       April 1995, and we began introducing our Internet-based trust services
       in June 1995. In addition, we have completed three acquisitions since
       1998. Accordingly, we have only a limited operating history on which to
       base an evaluation of our business and prospects. Our prospects must be
       considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by
       companies in the early stages of development. These risks and
       uncertainties are often worse for companies in new and rapidly evolving
       markets. Our success will depend on many factors, including, but not
       limited to, the following:

Ÿ

the rate and
         timing of the growth and use of IP networks for electronic commerce
         and communications;

Ÿ

the extent to
         which digital certificates are used for such communications and
         commerce;

Ÿ

the continued
         evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting
         business;

Ÿ

the demand for
         our Internet-based trust services;

Ÿ

competition
         levels;

Ÿ

the perceived
         security of electronic commerce and communications over IP
         networks;

Ÿ

the perceived
         security of our services, technology, infrastructure and practices;
         and

Ÿ

our continued
         ability to maintain our current, and enter into additional, strategic
         relationships.

To address
         these risks we must, among other things:

Ÿ

successfully
         market our Internet-based trust services and our digital certificates
         to our new and existing customers;

Ÿ

attract,
         integrate, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

Ÿ

respond to
         competitive developments;

Ÿ

successfully
         introduce new Internet-based trust services; and

Ÿ

successfully
         introduce enhancements to our existing Internet-based trust services
         to address new technologies and standards.

We cannot be certain that we
       will successfully address any of these risks.

We may not
         be able to integrate our recent acquisitions
         successfully

We acquired Thawte and Signio
       in February 2000 and we have recently agreed to acquire Network
       Solutions. We could experience difficulty in integrating the personnel,
       products, technologies or operations of these companies. In addition,
       assimilating acquired businesses involve a number of other risks,
       including, but not limited to:

Ÿ

the additional
         expense associated with the amortization of goodwill and other
         intangible assets, which we expect will be an aggregate of
         approximately $2 billion for the two acquisitions, and will be
         amortized generally from two to three years;

Ÿ

unanticipated
         costs or the incurrence of unknown liabilities;

Ÿ

the need to
         manage more geographically-dispersed operations, such as Thawte’s
         offices in North Carolina and South Africa;

Ÿ

diversion of
         management’s resources from other business concerns;

Ÿ

the inability
         to retain the employees of the acquired businesses;

Ÿ

adverse effects
         on existing customer relationships of Thawte or Signio;

Ÿ

the difficulty
         of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired
         businesses;

Ÿ

our inability
         to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our
         Internet-based trust services; and

Ÿ

the inability
         to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and
         policies.

In addition, in March 2000, we
       agreed to acquire Network Solutions. If this acquisition is consummated,
       we could experience similar integration issues.

We must
         manage our growth and expansion.

Our historical growth has
       placed, and any further growth is likely to continue to place, a
       significant strain on our resources. VeriSign has grown from 26
       employees at December 31, 1995 to 394 employees at December 31, 1999. We
       have also opened additional sales offices and have significantly
       expanded our operations, both in the U.S. and abroad, during this time
       period. We also expanded our operations by acquiring SecureIT during
       1998 and both Thawte and Signio in February 2000 and we will expand
       significantly if our proposed acquisition of Network Solutions is
       completed. To be successful, we will need to implement additional
       management information systems, develop further our operating,
       administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls and
       maintain close coordination among our executive, engineering,
       accounting, finance, marketing, sales and operations organizations. Any
       failure to manage growth effectively could materially harm our
       business.

We must
         establish and maintain strategic and other relationships with third
         parties.

One of our significant
       business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar
       collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base
       than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts. We
       may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business
       plan. We may not be able to enter into additional, or maintain our
       existing, strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms. If
       we failed, we would have to devote substantially more resources to the
       distribution, sale and marketing of our Internet-based trust services
       than we would otherwise. Furthermore, as a result of our emphasis on
       these relationships, our success in these relationships will depend both
       on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships,
       particularly in the use and promotion of IP networks for trusted and
       secure electronic commerce and communications, and on the ability of
       these parties to market our Internet-based trust services successfully.
       Failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result in the
       development and maintenance of a market for our Internet-based trust
       services could materially harm our business.

Our existing relationships
       do not, and any future relationships may not, afford VeriSign any
       exclusive marketing or distribution rights. In addition, the other
       parties may not view their relationships with us as significant for
       their own businesses. Therefore, they could reduce their commitment to
       VeriSign at any time in the future. These parties could also pursue
       alternative technologies or develop alternative products and services
       either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our
       competitors. If we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter
       into additional relationships, our business could be materially harmed.
       See “Business —Strategic Relationships” and “
       —Marketing, Sales and Distribution.”

Certain of
         our Internet-based trust services have lengthy sales and
         implementation cycles.

We market many of our
       Internet-based trust services directly to large companies and government
       agencies. The sale and implementation of our services to these entities
       typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant
       technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources. This
       process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers
       ’ internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large
       capital expenditures, deploying new technologies within their networks
       and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations.
       As a result, the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain
       of our Internet-based trust services can be lengthy, potentially lasting
       from three to six months. Our quarterly and annual operating results
       could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer
       for a particular quarter are not realized.

Our
         international operations are subject to certain risks.

Revenues of VeriSign Japan
       K.K., or VeriSign Japan, and revenues from other international
       affiliates and customers accounted for approximately 27% of our revenues
       in 1999. We intend to expand our international operations and
       international sales and marketing activities. For example, with our
       acquisition of Thawte we have additional operations in South Africa.
       Expansion into these markets has required and will continue to require
       significant management attention and resources. We may also need to
       tailor our Internet-based trust services for a particular market and to
       enter into international distribution and operating relationships. We
       have limited experience in localizing our Internet-based trust services
       and in developing international distribution or operating relationships.
       We may not succeed in expanding our Internet-based trust service
       offerings into international markets. Failure to do so could harm our
       business. In addition, there are risks inherent in doing business on an
       international basis, including, among others:

Ÿ

regulatory
         requirements;

Ÿ

legal
         uncertainty regarding liability;

Ÿ

export and
         import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products
         incorporating that technology;

Ÿ

tariffs and
         other trade barriers;

Ÿ

difficulties in
         staffing and managing foreign operations;

Ÿ

longer sales
         and payment cycles; problems in collecting accounts
         receivable;

Ÿ

difficulty of
         authenticating customer information;

Ÿ

political
         instability;

Ÿ

seasonal
         reductions in business activity; and

Ÿ

potentially
         adverse tax consequences.

We have licensed to
       international affiliates the VeriSign Processing Center platform, which
       is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the
       affiliate to offer back-end processing of Internet-based trust services.
       The VeriSign Processing Center platform provides an affiliate with the
       knowledge and technology to offer Internet-based trust services similar
       to those offered by VeriSign. It is critical to our business strategy
       that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing
       digital certificates remain
     secure and be perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although we
       provide the affiliate with training in security and trust practices,
       network management and customer service and support, these practices are
       performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control. Any failure
       of an affiliate to maintain the privacy of confidential customer
       information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely
       affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as
       well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over IP
       networks generally. See “—System interruptions and security
       breaches could harm our business” and “Business—VeriSign
       ’s Trust Services.”

All of our international
       revenues from sources other than VeriSign Japan are denominated in U.S.
       dollars. If additional portions of our international revenues were to be
       denominated in foreign currencies, we could become subject to increased
       risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. See
       “Business —Marketing, Sales and Distribution.
       ”

Acquisitions
         could harm our business.

During 1998, we acquired
       SecureIT and in February 2000, we acquired Thawte and Signio. In
       addition, we agreed to acquire Network Solutions in March 2000. We may
       acquire additional businesses, technologies, product lines or service
       offerings in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of risks
       including among others:

Ÿ

the difficulty
         of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired
         businesses;

Ÿ

the potential
         disruption of our business;

Ÿ

our inability
         to integrate, train, retain and motivate key personnel of the acquired
         business;

Ÿ

the diversion
         of our management from our day-to-day operations;

Ÿ

our inability
         to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our
         Internet-based trust services;

Ÿ

the additional
         expense associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any
         acquired intangible assets;

Ÿ

the potential
         impairment of relationships with our employees, customers and
         strategic partners; and

Ÿ

the inability
         to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and
         policies.

If we are unable to
       successfully address any of these risks, our business could be
       materially harmed.

Year 2000
       Issues

To date, we have experienced
       no significant disruption of our operations nor have our customers
       reported to us any significant problems with our products or services as
       a result of Year 2000 issues.

Liquidity and
       Capital Resources

Prior to our initial public
       offering, we financed our operations primarily through private sales of
       equity securities, raising approximately $46.1 million. Our initial
       public offering, which we completed in January 1998, yielded net
       proceeds of approximately $43.7 million. In January 1999, we sold an
       additional 6,390,000 shares of common stock to the public for net
       proceeds of approximately $121.4 million. At December 31, 1999, our
       principal source of liquidity was $156.5 million of cash, cash
       equivalents and
     short-term investments, consisting principally of commercial paper, medium
       term corporate notes, corporate bonds and notes, market auction
       securities, U.S. government and agency securities and money market
       funds.

Net cash provided by operating
       activities was $14.7 million in 1999, primarily as a result of net
       income after adjustment for non-cash items such as depreciation and
       amortization and cash provided by increased deferred revenue, which was
       partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and other current
       assets. Cash used in operating activities was $11.8 million in 1998 and
       $12.8 million in 1997. Net cash used in operating activities in 1998 and
       1997 was primarily the result of net losses and increases in accounts
       receivable which were partially offset by non-cash charges and increases
       in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred
       revenue.

Net cash used in investing
       activities was $103.2 million in 1999, $16.0 million in 1998 and $15.3
       million in 1997. In 1999, net cash used in investing activities
       primarily related to net purchases of short-term investments totaling
       $67.0 million and an increase of $26.5 million in long-term investments.
       In 1998 and 1997, net cash used in investing activities was primarily
       the result of capital expenditures for computer and communications
       equipment, purchased software, office equipment, furniture, fixtures and
       leasehold improvements. In addition, cash used in investing activities
       included net purchases of short-term investments of $11.0 million in
       1998 and $8.0 million in 1997. Capital expenditures for property and
       equipment totaled $6.0 million in 1999, $4.4 million in 1998 and $6.8
       million in 1997. Our planned capital expenditures for 2000 are
       approximately $6.0 million to $8.0 million, primarily for computer and
       communications equipment and leasehold improvements. In addition, we are
       currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, for
       which we expect to expend approximately $4.0 million in 2000. As of
       December 31, 1999, we also had commitments under noncancelable operating
       leases for our facilities for various terms through 2005. See Note 8 of
       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net cash provided by financing
       activities was $136.2 million in 1999, $45.7 million in 1998 and $3.1
       million in 1997. In 1999, we received net cash proceeds of $121.4
       million from the public offering of our stock and in 1998, we received
       net cash proceeds of $43.7 million from our initial public offering. In
       addition, net cash provided by financing activities of VeriSign Japan
       was $2.5 million in 1997, resulting from the sale of capital stock to
       minority investors and from the proceeds of bank borrowings.

We believe that our existing
       cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to
       meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the
       foreseeable future. However, at some time, we may need to raise
       additional funds through public or private financing, strategic
       relationships or other arrangements. Such additional funding, if needed,
       might not be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. If we have
       to enter into strategic relationships to raise additional funds we might
       be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies. Our
       failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business.
       If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity
       securities, the percentage of our stock owned by our then-current
       stockholders would be reduced. Furthermore, such equity securities might
       have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common
       stock.

Recent
       Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial
       Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
       Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133
       establishes methods for derivative financial instruments and hedging
       activities related to those instruments, as well as other hedging
       activities. Because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments
       and do not engage in hedging activities, we expect that the adoption of
       SFAS No. 133 will not have a material impact on our financial position,
       results of operations or cash flows. We will be required to implement
       SFAS No 133, as amended, for the year ending December 31,
       2001.

In December 1998, the AICPA
       issued SOP No. 98-9, “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
       Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions.” SOP No. 98-9
       requires recognition of revenue using the “residual method” in
       a multiple-element software arrangement when fair value does not exist
       for one or more
     of the delivered elements in the arrangement. Under the “residual
       method,” the total fair value of the undelivered elements is
       deferred and recognized in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. We will be
       required to implement SOP No. 98-9 for the year ending December 31,
       2000. SOP No. 98-9 also extended the deferral of the application of SOP
       No. 97-2 to certain other multiple-element software arrangements through
       our year ended December 31, 1999. We expect that the adoption of SOP No.
       98-9 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results
       of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest rate
       sensitivity

The primary objective of
       VeriSign’s investment activities is to preserve principal while at
       the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments
       without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities that we
       have invested in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change
       in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the
       investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was
       issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the
       prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our
       investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our
       portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of
       securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, corporate
       bonds and notes, market auction securities, U.S. government and agency
       securities and money market funds. In general, money market funds are
       not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds
       fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. In addition, we invest in
       relatively short-term securities. As of December 31, 1999, 90% of our
       non-strategic investments mature in less than one year. See Note 3 of
       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following table presents
       the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to
       market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted-average interest
       rates as of December 31, 1999. This table does not include money market
       funds because those funds are not subject to market risk.

Exchange rate
       sensitivity

VeriSign considers its
       exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal.
       Our recently established subsidiary in Sweden has not had significant
       operations to date. All revenues derived from our European affiliates
       are denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to
       exchange rate fluctuations.

Both the revenues and expenses
       of our majority-owned subsidiary in Japan are denominated in Japanese
       yen. This serves as a natural hedge because although an unfavorable
       change in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar
       will result in lower revenues when translated to U.S. dollars, operating
       expenses will also be lower in these circumstances.

Because of our minimal
       exposure to foreign currencies, we have not engaged in any hedging
       transactions to date.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA

Financial
       Statements

VeriSign’s financial
       statements required by this item are submitted as a separate section of
       this Form 10-K. See Item 14.(a)1 for a listing of financial statements
       provided in the section titled “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
       ”

Supplemental
       Data

The following tables set forth
       quarterly supplementary data for each of the years in the two-year
       period ended December 31, 1999 and reflect VeriSign’s results as
       restated to reflect our acquisition of SecureIT, Inc. in 1998, which was
       accounted for as a pooling of interests. See Note 2 of Notes to
       Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our quarterly operating
       results have varied and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a
       result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control.
       These factors include the following:

Ÿ

continued
         market acceptance of our Internet-based trust services;

Ÿ

the long sales
         and implementation cycles for, and potentially large order sizes of,
         certain of our Internet-based trust services;

Ÿ

the timing and
         execution of individual contracts;

Ÿ

customer
         renewal rates for our Internet-based trust services;

Ÿ

the timing of
         releases of new versions of Internet browsers or other third-party
         software products and networking equipment which include our digital
         certificate service interface technology;

Ÿ

the mix of our
         services sold during a quarter;

Ÿ

our success in
         marketing other Internet-based trust services to our existing
         customers and to new customers;

Ÿ

continued
         development of our direct and indirect distribution channels, both in
         the U.S. and abroad;

Ÿ

market
         acceptance of our Internet-based trust services or our competitors
         ’ products and services;

Ÿ

our ability to
         attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate a substantial number of
         sales and marketing, research and development and technical support
         personnel;

Ÿ

our ability to
         expand our operations;

Ÿ

our success in
         assimilating the operations and personnel of SecureIT and any other
         acquired businesses;

Ÿ

amortization of
         goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions;

Ÿ

other
         acquisition-related expenses;

Ÿ

the amount and
         timing of expenditures related to expansion of our
         operations;

Ÿ

the impact of
         price changes in our Internet-based trust services or our competitors
         ’ products and services; and

Ÿ

general global
         economic conditions and economic conditions specific to IP network
         industries.

Our limited operating history
       and the emerging nature of our market make it difficult to predict
       future revenues. Our expenses are based, in part, on our expectations
       regarding future revenues, and are largely fixed in nature, particularly
       in the short term. We may be unable to predict our future revenues
       accurately or to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for
       any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall
       of revenues in relation to our expectations could cause significant
       declines in our quarterly operating results.

Due to all of the foregoing
       factors, our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to
       forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our
       operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and you should not
       rely upon them as an indication of our future performance. Also, it is
       likely that our operating results will fall below our expectations and
       the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future
       quarter. In such event, the market price of our common stock could be
       materially adversely affected.

Proceeds from
       Public Offering

In January 1998, VeriSign
       completed the initial public offering of its common stock. The managing
       underwriters in the offering were Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated,
       Hambrecht & Quist LLC and Wessels, Arnold & Henderson L.L.C. We
       realized net proceeds from the offering of approximately $43.7 million
       after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses
       of the offering. Through December 31, 1999, we used approximately $14.9
       million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund operating
       expenses, the transaction charges related to the acquisition of SecureIT
       and increased working capital. Approximately $10.4 million of the net
       proceeds was used to purchase and install computers and peripheral
       equipment and leasehold improvements and approximately $12.9 million was
       used to invest in certain companies as long-term investments. The
       remaining $5.5 million has been invested in short-term,
       interest-bearing, investment grade securities.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT

VeriSign’s management is
       responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the
       consolidated financial statements and other financial information
       presented in this report. The accompanying consolidated financial
       statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
       accounting principles and reflect the effects of certain estimates and
       judgments made by management.

VeriSign’s management
       maintains an effective system of internal control that is designed to
       provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
       transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with
       management’s authorization. The system is continuously monitored by
       direct management review. VeriSign selects and trains qualified people
       who are provided with and expected to adhere to our standards of
       business conduct. These standards, which set forth the highest
       principles of business ethics and conduct, are a key element of our
       control system.

VeriSign’s consolidated
       financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent
       auditors. Their audits were conducted in accordance with generally
       accepted auditing standards, and included a review of financial controls
       and tests of accounting records and procedures as they considered
       necessary in the circumstances.

The Audit Committee of the
       Board of Directors, which consists of outside directors, meets regularly
       with management and the independent auditors to review accounting,
       reporting, auditing and internal control matters. The committee has
       direct and private access to both internal and external
       auditors.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of
       Directors and Stockholders of VeriSign, Inc.:

We have audited the
       accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VeriSign, Inc. and
       subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related
       consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity,
       comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the years in the
       three-year period ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial
       statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
       responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
       statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
       accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards
       require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
       assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
       misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
       supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
       audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
       significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
       overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
       provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
       consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
       all material respects, the financial position of VeriSign, Inc. and
       subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
       operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
       period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
       accounting principles.

DECEMBER 31,
       1999, 1998 AND 1997

Note 1. 
          Description of Business and Summary of Significant
       Accounting Policies

Business

VeriSign, Inc. was
       incorporated in Delaware in April 1995 when RSA Data Security, Inc. (
       “RSA”) contributed equipment, other assets and technology for
       common stock. This transfer of nonmonetary assets was recorded at the
       founder’s historical cost basis. VeriSign provides Internet-based
       trust services needed by websites, enterprises and individuals to
       conduct trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over
       the Internet, intranets and extranets (“IP Networks”).
       VeriSign provides both public and private certificate authority services
       to organizations needing digital certificates for website
       authentication, intranet and extranet access control, electronic
       commerce services and virtual private network connections.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated
       financial statements include the accounts of VeriSign and its
       subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
       transactions. As of December 31, 1999, VeriSign owned approximately
       50.5% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of its subsidiary,
       VeriSign Japan K.K. Changes in VeriSign’s proportionate share of
       the net assets of VeriSign Japan resulting from sales of capital stock
       by the subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions.

Foreign
         Currency Translation

The functional currency for
       VeriSign’s international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar; however,
       the subsidiaries books of record are maintained in local currency. As a
       result, the subsidiaries’ financial statements are remeasured into
       U.S. dollars using a combination of current and historical exchange
       rates and any transaction gains and losses are included in operating
       results.

Cash, Cash
         Equivalents, and Short and Long-Term Investments

VeriSign considers all highly
       liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date
       of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include
       money market funds, commercial paper, market auction securities, and
       various deposit accounts.

VeriSign’s investments
       are classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair
       value based on quoted market prices. These investments consist of
       commercial paper, medium term notes, U.S. government and agency
       securities and corporate bonds and notes. These investments with
       original maturities greater than three months and less than twelve
       months are considered short-term investments and those with original
       maturities greater than twelve months are considered long-term
       investments. Realized gains and losses upon sale or maturity of these
       investments are determined using the specific identification
       method.

VeriSign invests in equity
       instruments of privately-held, technology companies for business and
       strategic purposes. These investments are included in long-term
       investments and are accounted for under the cost method. For these
       non-quoted investments, VeriSign’s policy is to regularly review
       the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow
       forecasts in assessing the carrying values. VeriSign identifies and
       records impairment losses on long-lived assets when events and
       circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. To date, no
       such impairment has been recorded. During 1999, one of these investments
       in Keynote Systems, Inc., became a marketable equity security when
       Keynote Systems, Inc. completed their initial public offering. This
       investment is subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value
       due to the volatility of the stock market, and is recorded in long-term
       investments.

       AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
       CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31,
       1999, 1998 AND 1997

Property
         and Equipment

Property and equipment are
       stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated
       using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
       assets, generally three to five years.

Computer
         Software Costs

In March 1998, the AICPA
       issued SOP 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
       Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” SOP 98-1 requires that
       entities capitalize certain costs related to internal-use software once
       certain criteria have been met. The Company implemented SOP 98-1 for the
       year ended December 31, 1999.

Revenue
         Recognition

Revenues from our services
       consist of fees for the issuance of digital certificates, fees for
       digital certificate service provisioning, fees for technology and
       business process licensing to affiliates and fees for consulting,
       implementation, training, support and maintenance services. Each of
       these sources of revenue has different revenue recognition methods. We
       defer revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates and
       recognize these revenues ratably over the life of the digital
       certificate, generally 12 months. We defer revenues from the sale of our
       OnSite managed services and recognize these revenues ratably over the
       term of the license, generally 12 months. We recognize revenues from the
       sale of digital certificate technology and business process licensing to
       affiliates upon delivery of the technology and signing of an agreement,
       provided the fee is fixed and determinable, collectibility is probable
       and the arrangement does not require significant production,
       modification or customization of the software. We recognize revenues
       from consulting and training services using the percentage-of-completion
       method for fixed-fee development arrangements or as the services are
       provided for time-and-materials arrangements. We recognize revenues
       ratably over the term of the agreement for support and maintenance
       services.

VeriSign recognizes revenue in
       accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
       ’ (“AICPA”) Statement of Position (“SOP”) No.
       97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition.” SOP No. 97-2 generally
       requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple
       elements to be allocated to each element based on its relative fair
       value. The fair value of the element must be based on objective evidence
       that is specific to the vendor. If a vendor does not have objective
       evidence of the fair value of all elements in a multiple-element
       arrangement, all revenue from the arrangement must be deferred until
       such evidence exists or until all elements have been
       delivered.

Research and
         Development Costs

Research and development costs
       are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred subsequent to establishing
       technological feasibility, in the form of a working model, are
       capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives. To date,
       software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has
       been established have not been material.

Advertising
         Expense

Advertising expense is charged
       to operations as incurred. Advertising expense was $3,037,000 in 1999,
       $1,858,000 in 1998 and $197,000 in 1997.

VERISIGN, INC.
       AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
       CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31,
       1999, 1998 AND 1997

Income
         Taxes

VeriSign uses the asset and
       liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
       liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
       to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
       existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
       tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
       to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
       differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
       deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
       recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
       valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets whose
       realization is not sufficiently likely.

Stock-Based
         Compensation

VeriSign accounts for its
       equity-based compensation plan using the intrinsic value
       method.

Net Income
         (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per
       share is computed using the weighted average number of outstanding
       shares of common stock. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed
       using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
       plus the dilutive effect of stock options computed using the treasury
       stock method and convertible securities using the if-converted
       method.

The following table presents
       the calculation for the number of shares used in the basic and diluted
       net income (loss) per share computations:

For 1999, VeriSign excluded
       from the calculation of diluted net income per share 481,320 shares
       related to stock options with an exercise price higher than $49.70, the
       weighted average fair market value for the year. For 1998 and 1997,
       VeriSign excluded all convertible preferred stock and outstanding stock
       options from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because these
       securities would have been anti-dilutive for these periods. The excluded
       shares totaled 16,516,368 shares for 1998 and 50,495,180 shares for
       1997.

Other
       Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income
       (loss) includes gains and losses that are not included in net income
       (loss) but instead are recorded directly in stockholders’ equity.
       Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains (losses) on
       investments.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
       potentially subject VeriSign to significant concentrations of credit
       risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term
       investments and accounts receivable. VeriSign
     maintains its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with high
       quality financial institutions and, as part of its cash management
       process, performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing
       of these financial institutions. VeriSign also performs ongoing credit
       evaluations of its customers and, generally, requires no collateral.
       VeriSign maintains an allowance for potential credit losses. Amounts
       added to the allowance for doubtful accounts through charges to bad debt
       expense totaled $859,000 in 1999, $590,000 in 1998 and $387,000 in 1997.
       Uncollectible amounts written off totaled $268,000 in 1999, $359,000 in
       1998 and $136,000 in 1997.

Related
         Party Transactions

During 1998, VeriSign signed a
       joint venture agreement with certain companies located in France to form
       Certplus, a provider of Internet trust services. VeriSign has a minority
       interest of 15% in the joint venture, and therefore has accounted for
       this as a long-term investment. Certplus is an affiliate in the VeriSign
       affiliate program. Certplus accounted for approximately 1% of revenues
       in 1999 and less than 1% of revenues in 1998 and 1997. Certplus
       accounted for 1% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31,
       1999 and 2% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31,
       1998.

In February 1999, VeriSign
       entered into a memorandum of understanding with Keynote Systems.
       VeriSign is a 7% shareholder of Keynote as of December 31, 1999 and
       Stratton Sclavos, president and chief executive officer is a member of
       Keynote’s board of directors. Under the agreement, VeriSign
       received from Keynote a non-exclusive license to sell two versions of
       Keynote’s services as an integrated part of VeriSign’s product
       offerings. Per the agreement, VeriSign will pay a fee to Keynote for
       each of these introductory services sold to a customer. In the event
       that Keynote converts the introductory customer into a paying customer
       within a certain timeframe, then Keynote will pay VeriSign a one-time
       bounty fee for each customer. Through December 31, 1999, VeriSign has
       received $20,000 in revenue and has paid Keynote approximately $250,000
       under this agreement.

VeriSign entered into a
       development agreement in September 1997 with RSA Security, formerly
       Security Dynamics Technologies, Inc. (“RSA Security”), the
       parent company of RSA, an approximately 5% stockholder of VeriSign at
       December 31, 1999, to develop a customized certificate authority product
       in order to enable RSA Security to offer a product with encryption and
       digital certificate authority functionality. In December 1998, VeriSign
       and RSA Security amended the development agreement to grant RSA Security
       an exclusive license to incorporate the developed technology into
       original equipment manufacturers’ (“OEM”) products in
       order to create products incorporating the technology and to sublicense
       the technology to licensees of the OEMs.

The development agreement
       provides that RSA Security pay VeriSign an aggregate of $2.7 million as
       an initial license fee, of which $.9 million was paid in October 1997,
       $1.4 million was paid during 1998 and $.4 million was paid during 1999.
       At the time of the execution of the amendment in December 1998, RSA
       Security paid VeriSign $500,000. Once RSA Security has received net
       revenues of $2.8 million from OEMs, it will pay VeriSign a royalty equal
       to the greater of 18% of net revenues from the sale to OEMs or 18% of
       60% of the current list price for the product. RSA Security will not be
       obligated to pay any royalties to VeriSign with respect to sales to
       value-added resellers.

In order for RSA Security to
       maintain its exclusivity rights, it must make certain minimum aggregate
       annual payments to VeriSign, which are payable on a quarterly basis. In
       addition, VeriSign will be obligated to pay RSA Security an amount equal
       to 8% of net revenue recognized by VeriSign during a VeriSign OnSite
     customers’ first year using VeriSign OnSite if the customer had
       previously purchased products from RSA Security that incorporate the
       developed technology.

Beginning in March 1998, RSA
       Security is required to pay VeriSign a monthly product support fee for a
       three-year period and thereafter for successive annual terms. For a
       yearly fee, RSA Security can purchase product maintenance services. RSA
       Security paid both support and maintenance fees aggregating $210,000 in
       1999 and $105,000 in 1998.

Revenue from the development
       agreement accounted for less than 1% of revenues in 1999, 6% of revenues
       in 1998 and 4% of revenues in 1997.

In July 1999, VeriSign entered
       into a non-exclusive reseller agreement with RSA Security to grant RSA
       Security the right to resell certain VeriSign products and services for
       a discounted fee. Revenue from the reseller agreement accounted for 1%
       of revenues in 1999.

At December 31, 1999, VeriSign
       had no customers that accounted for more than 10% of accounts
       receivable. At December 31, 1998, VeriSign had one customer, a South
       African systems integrator, that accounted for 18% of accounts
       receivable. VeriSign had one customer that accounted for 10% of revenues
       in 1997 and no other customers that accounted for more than 10% of
       revenues in 1999 or 1998. VeriSign had no other customers that accounted
       for more than 10% of accounts receivable for any of the dates or years
       presented.

Impairment
         of Long-Lived Assets

VeriSign reviews long-lived
       assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
       indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
       Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of the
       carrying amount to future net cash flows the assets are expected to
       generate. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
       recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
       long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value. To date, no adjustments
       to the carrying value of long-lived assets have been
       required.

Use of
         Estimates

The preparation of
       consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
       accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
       and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
       consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and
       expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
       those estimates.

Recent
         Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998 the Financial
       Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
       Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
       Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133 established
       methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging
       activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging
       activities. Because it currently holds no derivative instruments and
       does not engage in hedging activities, VeriSign expects that the
       adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have no material impact on its financial
       position, results of operations or cash flows. VeriSign will be required
       to implement SFAS No. 133, as amended, for the year ending December 31,
       2001.

VERISIGN, INC.
       AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
       CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31,
       1999, 1998 AND 1997

In December 1998, the AICPA
       issued SOP No. 98-9, “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
       Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions.” SOP No. 98-9
       requires recognition of revenue using the “residual method” in
       a multiple-element software arrangement when fair value does not exist
       for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement. Under the
       “residual method,” the total fair value of the undelivered
       elements is deferred and recognized in accordance with SOP No. 97-2.
       VeriSign will be required to implement SOP No. 98-9 for the year ending
       December 31, 2000. SOP No. 98-9 also extended the deferral of the
       application of SOP No. 97-2 to certain other multiple-element software
       arrangements through the year ended December 31, 1999. We expect that
       the adoption of SOP No. 98-9 will not have a material impact on our
       financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 2. 
          Business Combination

In July 1998, VeriSign
       completed a merger with SecureIT, Inc. (“SecureIT”). SecureIT
       is a provider of Internet and enterprise security solutions comprising a
       full range of products and services to assist clients with assessing,
       designing and implementing security solutions. The merger was effected
       by exchanging approximately 6,664,000 shares of VeriSign common stock
       for all of the outstanding common stock of SecureIT. Each share of
       SecureIT was exchanged for 0.164806 of one share of VeriSign common
       stock. In addition, outstanding SecureIT employee stock options were
       converted at the same exchange ratio into options to purchase
       approximately 760,000 shares of VeriSign common stock.

The merger constituted a
       tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for as a
       pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, all prior period financial statements
       have been restated to include the combined results of operations,
       financial position and cash flows of SecureIT as if it had always been a
       part of VeriSign. There were no intercompany transactions between
       VeriSign and SecureIT prior to the combination that required elimination
       and there were no material adjustments required to conform SecureIT
       ’s accounting policies to those of VeriSign. Direct costs and other
       related merger costs of approximately $3.6 million were incurred in
       connection with the acquisition (see Note 9).

The results of operations
       previously reported by the separate companies and the combined amounts
       presented in the consolidated financial statements are summarized
       below.

Stock
         Splits

In March 1999, the Board of
       Directors (the “Board”) declared a two-for-one stock split for
       stockholders of record on May 14, 1999. In November 1999, the Board
       declared an additional two-for-one stock split for stockholders of
       record on November 22, 1999. All share and per share information has
       been restated to reflect the effect of the stock splits.

Preferred
         Stock

VeriSign is authorized to
       issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31,
       1999, no shares of preferred stock had been issued.

Common
         Stock

On January 30, 1998, VeriSign
       completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) by issuing
       13,800,000 shares of its common stock at an initial public offering
       price of $3.50 per share. VeriSign received net proceeds from the
       offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
       offering expenses, of approximately $43.7 million. Concurrently with the
       IPO, each outstanding share of VeriSign’s convertible preferred
       stock was automatically converted into one share of common
       stock.

In January 1999, VeriSign
       completed a follow-on public offering by issuing 6,390,000 shares at an
       offering price of $20.13 per share. VeriSign received net proceeds from
       the offering of approximately $121.4 million.

No dividends have been
       declared or paid on common stock since VeriSign’s inception.
       SecureIT paid Subchapter S distributions of $793,000 to its stockholders
       for minimum tax obligations during the year ended December 31,
       1998.

Notes
         Receivable From Stockholders

In November 1996, VeriSign
       loaned several officers an aggregate of $543,000, due December 31, 2005,
       bearing interest at a rate per annum of 6.95%, payable quarterly. In
       August 1997, VeriSign loaned an officer an aggregate of $116,000, due
       December 31, 2006, bearing interest at a rate per annum of 6.87%,
       payable quarterly. The loans are full recourse and are collateralized by
       pledges of the shares of VeriSign common stock that were purchased. As
       of December 31, 1999, all loans had been repaid in full.

Note 6. 
          Stock Compensation Plans

Stock Option
         Plans

As of December 31, 1999, a
       total of 22,719,893 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance
       upon the exercise of stock options and for the future grant of stock
       options or awards under VeriSign’s equity incentive
       plans.

The 1995 Stock Option Plan and
       the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the “1995 and 1997 Plans”) were
       terminated concurrent with VeriSign’s IPO. Options to purchase
       common stock granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans remain outstanding
       and subject to the vesting and exercise terms of the original grant. All
       shares that remained available for future issuance under the 1995 and
       1997 Plans at the time of their termination were transferred to the 1998
       Equity Incentive Plan. No further options can be granted under the 1995
       and 1997 Plans. Options granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans are
       subject to terms substantially similar to those described below with
       respect to options granted under the 1998 Equity Incentive
       Plan.

The 1998 Equity Incentive Plan
       (the “1998 Plan”) authorizes the award of options, restricted
       stock awards and stock bonuses. As of December 31, 1998, no restricted
       stock awards or stock bonus awards have been made under the 1998
       Plan.

Options may be granted at an
       exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value of VeriSign
       ’s common stock on the date of grant for incentive stock options
       and 85% of the fair market value for nonqualified stock options. All
       options are granted at the discretion of the Board and have a term not
       greater than 7 years from the date of grant. Options issued generally
       vest 25% on the first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12
       quarters. At December 31, 1999, 4,677,031 shares remain available for
       future awards under the 1998 Plan.

Members of the Board who are
       not employees of VeriSign, or of any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of
       VeriSign, are eligible to participate in the 1998 Directors Plan (the
       “Directors Plan). The option grants under the Directors Plan are
       automatic and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options is
       100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the
       grant. Each eligible director who becomes a director on or after January
       28, 1998 will initially be granted an option to purchase 60,000 shares
       on the date he or she first becomes a director (the ”Initial Grant
       “). On each anniversary of a director’s Initial Grant or most
       recent grant if he or she was ineligible to receive an Initial Grant,
       each eligible director will automatically be granted an additional
       option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock if the director has
       served continuously as a director since the date of the Initial Grant or
       most recent grant. The term of the options under the Directors Plan is
       ten years and options vest as to 6.25% of the shares each quarter after
       the date of the grant, provided the optionee remains a director of
       VeriSign. At December 31, 1999, 200,000 shares remain available for
       future grant under the Directors Plan.

In connection with the
       acquisition of SecureIT, VeriSign assumed SecureIT’s 1997 Stock
       Option Plan (the “SecureIT Plan”). The SecureIT Plan provided
       for the grant of both fixed and performance-based stock
     options. Options granted under the SecureIT Plan generally have a term of
       seven years and vest over a four-year period, 25% on each anniversary of
       the grant date. No further options can be granted under the SecureIT
       Plan.

A summary of stock option
       activity under the Plans follows:

The following table summarizes
       information about stock options outstanding as of December 31,
       1999:

         Employee Stock Purchase Plan

VeriSign has reserved
       3,000,000 shares for issuance under the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
       Plan (“Purchase Plan”). Eligible employees may purchase common
       stock through payroll deductions by electing to have between 2% and 15%
       of their compensation withheld. Each participant is granted an option to
       purchase
     common stock on the first day of each 24 month offering period and this
       option is automatically exercised on the last day of each six month
       purchase period during the offering period. The purchase price for the
       common stock under the Purchase Plan is 85% of the lesser of the fair
       market value of the common stock on the first day of the applicable
       offering period and the last day of the applicable purchase period. The
       first offering period began on January 30, 1998. Offering periods
       thereafter will begin on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Shares of
       common stock issued under the Purchase Plan totaled 547,896 in 1999 and
       232,900 in 1998. As of December 31, 1999, 2,219,204 shares remain
       available for future issuance. The weighted-average fair value of the
       options granted under the Purchase Plan was $15.28 in 1999 and $7.18 in
       1998.

Pro Forma
         Information

VeriSign applies the intrinsic
       value method in accounting for its equity-based compensation plan. Had
       compensation cost for its equity-based compensation plans been
       determined consistent with the fair value approach set forth in SFAS No.
       123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” VeriSign
       ’s net income (loss) would have been as follows:

The fair value of stock
       options and Purchase Plan options granted subsequent to VeriSign’s
       IPO on January 30, 1998 was estimated on the date of grant using the
       Black-Scholes model. The fair value of stock options granted prior to
       the IPO and for stock options granted by SecureIT prior to its
       acquisition was estimated on the date of grant using the minimum value
       method. The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions
       used to calculate the fair value of the stock options and Purchase Plan
       options for each period presented.

Volatility was
         zero under the minimum value method for grants prior to January 30,
         1998 and for all grants made by SecureIT prior to its acquisition by
         VeriSign.

The difference between income
       tax expense and the amount resulting from applying the Federal statutory
       rate of 34% to income before income taxes for 1999 is attributable to
       the following:

In 1998 and 1997, the Company
       did not record any income tax expense because it experienced significant
       operating losses.

DECEMBER 31,
       1999, 1998 AND 1997

The tax effects of temporary
       differences that give rise to significant portions of VeriSign’s
       deferred tax assets are as follows:

Management has established a
       valuation allowance equal to 100% of the net deferred tax assets because
       the realization of the deferred tax assets is uncertain. The total
       valuation allowance decreased $18,439,000 in 1999 and increased
       $13,250,000 in 1998.

Gross deferred tax assets as
       of December 31, 1999 include approximately $36,919,000 relating to the
       exercise of stock options, which is subject to a valuation allowance of
       approximately $7,736,000. Upon reversal of this valuation allowance, the
       tax benefit thus realized will be credited to stockholders’
       equity.

As of December 31, 1999,
       VeriSign has available net operating loss carryforwards for federal
       income tax purposes of approximately $127,376,000 and for California
       income tax purposes of approximately $64,510,000. The federal net
       operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in 2010
       through 2019. The California net operating loss carryforwards will
       expire, if not utilized, in 2004.

As of December 31, 1999,
       VeriSign has available for carryover research and experimentation tax
       credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,444,000 and
       for California income tax purposes of approximately $1,004,000. The
       federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not
       utilized, in 2010 through 2019. California research and experimental tax
       credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized. VeriSign also has
       federal foreign tax credits of approximately $758,000, which expire, if
       not utilized, in 2001 through 2002. To date, foreign income taxes have
       not been significant.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986
       imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating
       losses and tax credits in the event of an “ownership change”
       of a corporation. Accordingly, VeriSign’s ability to utilize net
       operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited as a result of
       such an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue
       Code.

       $1,722,000 in 1997. VeriSign has sub-leased an office to a company under
       a non-cancelable operating lease. VeriSign received payments of $507,000
       during 1999 and will receive payments of $778,000 during 2000 and
       $533,000 during 2001.

          Special Charges

Merger-related expenses

In connection with the
       acquisition of SecureIT in July 1998 (see Note 2), VeriSign recorded a
       special charge of $3.6 million for direct and other merger-related costs
       pertaining to the merger transaction and certain stock-based
       compensation charges. Merger transaction costs totaled $2.4 million and
       consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys and
       accountants, filing fees and other related charges. The stock-based
       compensation charges of $1.2 million related to certain performance
       stock options held by SecureIT employees, the vesting of which either
       automatically accelerated upon change of control or were accelerated by
       VeriSign’s Board of Directors subsequent to the merger.

VeriFone

In September 1996, VeriFone,
       Inc. which subsequently became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
       Hewlett-Packard, filed a lawsuit against VeriSign alleging, among other
       things, trademark infringement. In November 1997, VeriSign,
       Hewlett-Packard and VeriFone reached an agreement, under which, among
       other things, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock,
       which were transferred to Hewlett-Packard, and VeriSign and VeriFone
       settled all claims. The settlement amount was recorded in the third
       quarter of 1997 as a $2.0 million charge to operations.

Microsoft

In November 1997, VeriSign
       entered into a preferred provider agreement with Microsoft Corporation (
       “Microsoft”) whereby the companies will develop, promote and
       distribute a variety of client-based and server-based digital
       certificate solutions and VeriSign will be designated as the premier
       provider of digital certificates for Microsoft customers. In connection
       with the agreement, VeriSign issued 400,000 shares of common stock to
       Microsoft resulting in an $800,000 charge to operations.

          Segment Information

VeriSign has adopted Statement
       of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about
       Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”. This statement
       establishes standards for publicly held entities to follow in reporting
       information about operating segments in annual financial statements and
       requires that those entities report selected information about operating
       segments in interim financial statements. This statement also
       establishes standards for related disclosures about product and
       services, geographic areas and major customers. Operating segments are
       defined by SFAS No. 131 as components of an enterprise about which
       separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
       by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
       resources and in assessing performance. VeriSign has identified one
       reportable operating segment based on the criteria of SFAS No.
       131.

VeriSign operates in the
       United States, Europe and Japan and derives substantially all of its
       revenues from sales of Internet-based trust services. VeriSign’s
       Chief Executive and Executive Officers evaluate financial performance
       based on measures of business segment revenues.

Geographic
         information

In general, revenues are
       attributed to the country in which the contract originated. However,
       revenues from all digital certificates issued from the Mountain View,
       California facility are attributed to the United States because it is
       impracticable to determine the country of origin.

Long-lived assets consist
       primarily of property and equipment and long-term
       investments.

Major
         customers

VeriSign had one customer that
       accounted for 10% of consolidated revenues in 1997 (see Note 1). No
       customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues in 1999 or
       1998.
