Information Services

VeriSign’s Information Services business includes our domain name registry services for the

.com

and

.net

gTLDs and certain ccTLDs,
managed domain name services, intelligent supply chain services, real-time publisher services and digital brand management services.



Domain Name Registry Services

.    We are the exclusive registry of domain
names within the

.com

and

.net

gTLDs under agreements with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, and the Department of Commerce, or DOC. As a registry, we maintain the master directory of all second-level
domain names in these top-level domains. We own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new second-level domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications, transfers, re-registrations and
deletions for existing second-level domain names.

We are also
the exclusive registry for domain names within the

.tv

and

.cc

ccTLDs. These top-level domains are supported by our global name server constellation and shared registration system. In addition, we have made

.bz

domain name
registration services available through our outsourced hosting environment, which enables domain name registrars and resellers to simultaneously access

.bz

registries. We also provide internationalized domain name, or IDN, services that
enable Internet users to access Web sites in their local language characters. Currently, IDNs are available in more than 350 languages such as Chinese, Greek, Korean and Russian.

Intelligent Supply Chain Services.

We offer supply chain information for retail,
pharmaceutical and consumer goods customers for marketing and operations purposes. Our point-of-sale data service is a hosted, Web-based solution for accessing and managing daily updates of point-of-sale data from multiple key retailer
partners. An electronic product code is a unique number that corresponds with an individual product (or container of products). Radio frequency identification (“RFID”) tags are small chips with antennas that contain an electronic product
code (“EPC”). We have been selected by EPCglobal, a not-for-profit joint-venture formed by The Uniform Code Council, Inc. and EAN International, to operate the authoritative root directory for the EPCglobal Network, the authoritative
directory of information sources that are available to describe products assigned EPCs. The EPCglobal Network is a concept that if proven will enable users to find and share information about products in the supply chain using the Internet
infrastructure. For example, by using an EPC in conjunction with the EPCglobal Network, a manufacturer or retailer would be able to look up detailed information about a product or package, such as its manufacture date, location and expiration date.
Additionally, we offer managed services that are designed to work in conjunction with RFID and bar code technology and the EPC root directory to facilitate the secure sharing of product data across diverse supply chains.

Real-Time Publisher Services.

We offer a suite
of intelligent infrastructure services that allow organizations to collect and organize large amounts of constantly updated content, and distribute it, in real time, to enterprises, web-portal developers, application developers, and consumers. The
real-time publisher services also make it easier for publishers of all sizes to distribute and track their content feeds, which may improve the reliability and quality of their real-time content.

Digital Brand Management Services.

We offer a
range of services that we refer to as digital brand management services to help enterprises, legal professionals, information technology professionals and brand marketers monitor, protect and build digital brand equity. These services include domain
name registration services for both gTLDs such as

.com

and ccTLDs, such as

.de

and

.jp

, and our brand monitoring services.

Communications Services Group

The Communications Services Group provides managed solutions to fixed line, broadband, mobile operators and enterprise customers through our integrated
communications, content and commerce platform. Our communications services offerings include network connectivity and interoperability services and intelligent database services; our content services offerings include content and application
services and messaging services; and our commerce services offerings include clearing and settlement services, and billing and payment services.

Operations Infrastructure

Our operations
infrastructure consists of secure data centers in Mountain View, California; Dulles, Virginia; Lacey, Washington; Providence, Rhode Island; Overland Park, Kansas; Melbourne, Australia; and Kawasaki, Japan. Most of these secure data centers operate
on a 24-hour a day, 7 days per week, 365 days a year basis, supporting our business units and services. Key features of our operations infrastructure include:

•

Distributed Servers.

We deploy a large number of high-speed servers to support capacity and availability demands that in conjunction with our
proprietary software offers automatic failover, global and local load balancing and threshold monitoring on critical servers.



•

Advanced Telecommunications.

We deploy and maintain redundant telecommunications and routing hardware and maintain high-speed connections to multiple
Internet service providers (“ISPs”) to ensure that our mission critical services are readily accessible to customers at all times.

•

Network Security.

We incorporate architectural concepts such as protected domains, restricted nodes and distributed access control in our system
architecture. We have also developed proprietary communications protocols within and between software modules that are designed to prevent most known forms of electronic attacks. In addition, we employ firewalls and intrusion detection software, and
contract with security consultants who perform periodic attacks to test our systems and security risk assessments.

As part of our operations infrastructure for our domain name registry services, we operate all domain name servers that answer domain name lookups for the

.com

and

.net

zones. We also operate two of the thirteen externally visible root zone server addresses, including the “A” root, which is considered to be the authoritative root zone server of the Internet’s domain name
system (“DNS”). The domain name servers provide the associated name server and IP address for every

.com

and

.net

domain name on the Internet and a large number of other top-level domain queries, resulting in an average of
over 15 billion responses per day during 2005. These name servers are located around the world, providing local domain name service throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Each server facility is a controlled and monitored environment,
incorporating security and system maintenance features. This network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the Internet’s DNS infrastructure.

To provide our communications services, we operate a SS7 network composed of specialized switches, computers and databases strategically located across
the United States. These elements interconnect our customers and U.S. telecommunications carriers through leased lines. Our network currently consists of 16 mated pairs of SS7 signal transfer points (“STPs”) that are specialized switches
that route SS7 signaling messages, and into which our customers connect. We own ten pairs of STPs and lease capacity on six pairs of STPs from regional providers. Our SS7 network control center, located in Overland Park, Kansas, is staffed 24 hours
a day, 365 days a year.

Call Centers and Help
Desk.

We provide customer support services through our phone-based call centers, email help desks and Web-based self-help systems. Our California call center is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and employs an
automated call directory system to support our Security Services business. Our Georgia call center is staffed from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time and our Washington state call center is staffed from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time and
employs an automated call directory system to support our Communications Services business. Our Virginia call center is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to support our Information Services business. All call centers have a staff of trained
customer support agents and provide Web-based support services that are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, utilizing customized automatic response systems to provide self-help recommendations.

Operations Support and Monitoring

.    We have an
extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical database systems and our global resolution systems. Our distributed Network Operations Centers are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Disaster Recovery Plans

.    We have
disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities. Our Information Services business maintains dual mirrored data centers that allow rapid failover with no data
loss and no loss of function or capacity. Our PKI business is similarly protected by having service capabilities that exist in both of our East and West Coast data center facilities. Our critical data services (including digital certificates, domain
name registration, telecommunications services and global resolution) use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as mirroring and remote replication.



Marketing, Sales and Distribution

We market our services worldwide through multiple distribution channels, including the Internet, direct sales, telesales,
direct marketing through all media, mass merchandisers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and VeriSign Affiliates. We intend to increase our direct sales force in the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group both in the
United States and abroad, and to expand our other distribution channels in both businesses.

Our direct sales and marketing organization at December 31, 2005 consisted of 763 individuals, including managers, sales representatives, marketing, technical and customer support personnel. We have field sales
offices throughout the world.

Research and Development

As of December 31, 2005, we had 801 employees dedicated to research and
development. Research and development expenses were $95.3 million in 2005, $60.4 million in 2004, and $49.4 million in 2003. We believe that timely development of new and enhanced Internet security, e-commerce, information, and communications
services and technologies are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend to continue recruiting and hiring experienced research and development personnel and to make additional investments in research and development.

Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to
continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services. In the past, we have developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers. We have also, in certain
circumstances, acquired or licensed technology from third parties. Although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts, we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new
services will be developed internally or acquired through business acquisitions.

The markets for our services are dynamic, characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The constantly changing nature of these markets and
their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services, particularly in response to competitive offerings, and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and
prior to our competitors.

Competition

Competition in Security Services

.    Our security
services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for Internet security services, including network security, authentication and validation, which enable secure electronic commerce and communications over wireline and wireless IP networks. The
market for security services is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants.

Principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories:
(1) companies such as RSA Security and Entrust Technologies, which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves; (2) companies such as GeoTrust and Digital Signature Trust Company
(a subsidiary of Identrus) that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authority, or CA, related services; and (3) companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as CyberTrust. We also experience
competition from a number of smaller companies, and we believe that our primary long-term competitors may not yet have entered the market. Furthermore, Netscape and Microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management
of digital certificates, and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products.



In addition, browser
companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their Web browsers or on their Web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for
promotions in the future.

Competition in Managed Security
Services

.    Consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with Internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services. These companies include large systems
integrators and consulting firms, such as Accenture, IBM Global Services, Getronics and Lucent NetCare. We also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services, such as Symantec and
ISS, as well as a number of providers such as CyberTrust and Counterpane that offer managed security services exclusively. Telecommunications providers, such as MCI that acquired NetSec, provide managed security services and are competitors. In
addition, we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of IP addresses and name maps throughout enterprise-wide intranets, and with companies with internally developed systems integration efforts.

Competition in Communications
Services.

The market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure. Competition in this area arises from two primary sources. Incumbent carriers provide competing in-house
services in their respective regions. In addition, we face direct competition from national, unregulated companies, including Syniverse Technologies, Telcordia, NeuStar and other carriers such as Southern New England Telephone Diversified Group, a
unit of AT&T. Furthermore, customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers, such as VeriSign, and
further increase competitive pricing pressures.

Competition
in Commerce Services.

Our wireless billing and payment services also are subject to competition from providers such as Comverse, Amdocs, Convergys Corporation and Boston Communications Group. We are also aware of major
Internet service providers, software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are or may in the future be focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that may compete directly with ours. Furthermore,
customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as VeriSign and further increase competitive pricing
pressures.

Competition in Content
Services.

The market for content services is extremely competitive. Competitors include developers of content and entertainment products and services in a variety of domestic and international markets, such as Jamdat
Mobile, LaNetro Zed, Infospace, Itouch, Wisdom Entertainment, Arvato mobile, Monstermob, Motricity and Buongiorno/Vitaminic. This business also faces competition from mobile network operators, such as Cingular, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile,
Vodafone, O


, Orange, E-Plus and Telefónica, as well as Internet portal operators, such as Yahoo!, AOL,
T-Online and Google. Our inter-carrier messaging services face competition from Mobile 365, Openwave and Comverse. Additional competitors are handset manufacturers, such as Nokia and software providers such as Microsoft and Apple. As the market for
wireless data, including information and entertainment data, matures, new categories of competitors, such as mobile phone companies, broadcasters, music publishers, other content providers or others have begun to develop competing products or
services.

Competition in Registry
Services.

There are several registry service providers for new gTLDs that directly compete with the services we provide for the

.com

and

.net

gTLDs, as well as with the ccTLDs offered by us. The gTLDs

.biz

and

.info

were launched in 2001, the gTLDs

.name, .pro, .aero, .museum

and

.coop

were launched in 2002 and 2003, and the gTLD .

mobi

was launched in 2005. Domain names registrations and other services within
these gTLDs are available through ICANN accredited registrars. In addition, we currently face competition from the over 240 ccTLD registry operators who compete directly for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a
Web presence.



We also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration,
resolutions and other DNS services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure. Among the competitors are UltraDNS, NeuLevel, Affilias, Register.com and Tucows.com.

Competition in Intelligent Supply Chain
Services.

There are a number of companies that provide intelligent supply chain services. For point-of-sale data, we face competition from IRI and AC Nielsen, as well as smaller software companies. For consulting services,
we face competition from traditional consulting firms.

Competition in Real-Time Publisher Services

.    We face competition from various smaller companies providing similar services.

Competition in Digital Brand Management Services.

We face competition from companies providing
services similar to some of our Digital Brand Management Services. In the monitoring services, registration and domain name asset management area of our business, our competition comes primarily from ICANN accredited registrars and various smaller
companies providing similar services.

Several of our current
and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities,
technologies, standards and customer requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other
means. If such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers, the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our
services would be substantially diminished.

New technologies
and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure. We cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render
our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors. The existence or announcement of any such relationships could
adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors, and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm
our business.

Industry Regulation

Information Services.

Within the U.S.
Government, leadership for the continued privatization of Internet administration is currently provided by the Department of Commerce.

On November 10, 1999, we entered into a series of wide-ranging agreements. These agreements included the following:

•

a registry agreement between us and ICANN under which we will continue to act as the exclusive registry for the

.com

and

.net

TLDs for at least four years from that
date. This agreement was subsequently replaced with three new registry agreements on May 25, 2001;

•

a revised registrar license and agreement between us as registry and all registrars registering names in the

.com, .net

and

.org

domains using our proprietary shared
registration system;

•

an amendment to the cooperative agreement; and

•

an amendment to the Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Government and ICANN.



Our registry agreement with
ICANN was replaced by three new agreements on May 25, 2001, one for

.com

, one for

.net

and one for

.org

. The term of the

.com

registry agreement extends until November 10, 2007 with a 4-year renewal option. The

.net

registry services were subject to a competitive bidding process administered by ICANN. Our bid was determined by the outside evaluators selected by ICANN to be the top bid and VeriSign and ICANN have executed a new

.net

registry
agreement that extends until September 30, 2011. The

.org

registry agreement terminated on December 31, 2002, and the

.org

registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by ICANN during 2003.

The descriptions of these agreements are qualified in their
entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are filed as exhibits to the periodic reports indicated in the index to the exhibits contained in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Security Services.

Some of our security
services utilize and incorporate encryption technology. Exports of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the United States and various non-United States governments. We have obtained approval to
export many of the security services we provide to customers globally under applicable United States export law, including our server digital certificate services. As the list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or
changed, government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets. If we do not obtain required approvals, we may not be able to
sell some of our security services in international markets.

There are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certification authorities, but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to certification authorities. If we do not comply
with these state laws and regulations, we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us. Moreover, if our market for digital certificates grows, the United States federal, state, or foreign governments may
choose to enact further regulations governing certification authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services. These regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could have a material, adverse impact
on our business.

Communications
Services.

One service provided by the Communications Services Group is currently subject to Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulation. This service allows wireless users who are “roaming” in
areas where their home carrier has not made arrangements for automatic roaming service to complete calls to domestic and international destinations. The Communications Services Group has been authorized by the FCC to provide this service. Further,
our communications customers are subject to FCC regulation, which indirectly affects our communications services business. We cannot predict when, or upon what terms and conditions, further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of
regulation or deregulation on our business. Several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services, which may increase our costs of operations. In addition, future services we may
provide could be subject to direct government regulation.

Intellectual
Property

We rely primarily on a combination of
copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property. We also enter into confidentiality and/or invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and current
and potential affiliates, customers and business partners. We also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information.

We have been issued numerous patents in the United States and abroad, covering a wide range of our technology. Additionally,
we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices. The national or international patent offices may not award any patents with respect to these
applications and even if such patents are awarded, they may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property.



We have obtained U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for various VeriSign marks. We have also filed
numerous applications to register VeriSign trademarks and claims, and have common law rights in many other proprietary names. We take steps to enforce and police VeriSign’s marks.

With regard to our Security Services business, we also rely on certain licensed third-party technology, such as public key
cryptography technology licensed from RSA and other technology that is used in our security services to perform key functions. RSA has granted us a perpetual, royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide license to use RSA’s products relating to
certificate issuing, management and processing functionality. We develop services that contain or incorporate the RSA BSAFE products and that relate to digital certificate-issuing software, software for the management of private keys and for
digitally signing computer files on behalf of others, software for customers to preview and forward digital certificate requests to them. RSA’s BSAFE product is a software tool kit that allows for the integration of encryption and
authentication features into software applications.

With
regard to our Information Services business, our principal intellectual property consists of, and our success is dependent upon, proprietary software used in our registry service business and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in
both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and Internet-based products and services businesses, including the conversion of internationalized domain names. We own our proprietary shared registration system through
which competing registrars submit

.com

and

.net

second-level domain name registrations. Some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors.

With regard to our Communications Services Group, we offer a
wide variety of services, including network connectivity and interoperability, intelligent database, content and applications, and clearing and settlement services, each of which are protected by trade secret, patents and/or patent applications. We
have also entered into agreements with third-party providers and licensors, including third party providers of content such as music, games and logos.

Employees

The following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function:

We have never had a
work stoppage, and no U.S.-based employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon
our continued ability to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate highly qualified sales, technical and managerial personnel, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel, none of whom is bound
by an employment agreement. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense, particularly for software development personnel.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because
these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained in
this Form 10-K as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain.

Our operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our
control. These factors include the following:

•

the long sales and implementation cycles for, and potentially large order sizes of, some of our security and communications services and the timing and execution of individual
customer contracts;

•

volume of domain name registrations and customer renewals in our registry services business;

•

the mix of all our services sold during a period;

•

our success in marketing and market acceptance of our services by our existing customers and by new customers;

•

changes in marketing expenses related to promoting and distributing our services;

•

customer renewal rates and turnover of customers of our services;

•

continued development of our direct and indirect distribution channels for our security services and communications services (including our content services), both in the U.S. and
abroad;

•

changes in the level of spending for information technology-related products and services by enterprise customers;

•

our success in assimilating the operations, products, services and personnel of any acquired businesses;

•

the seasonal fluctuations in consumer use of communications services, including our content services;

•

the timing and execution of individual customer contracts, particularly large contracts;

•

the impact of price changes in our communications services and security services or our competitors’ products and services;

•

the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R that will require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants; and

•

general economic and market conditions as well as economic and market conditions specific to the telecommunications and Internet industries.

Our operating expenses may increase. If an increase in our expenses is not
accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues, our operating results will suffer, particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service, rather than immediately when the customer pays for
them, unlike our sales and marketing expenditures, which are expensed in full when incurred.

Due to all of the above factors, our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and
you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Also, operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods. If this were to occur, the market
price of our common stock would likely decline.



Our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and
market conditions.

Adverse economic conditions worldwide
have contributed to downturns in the telecommunications and technology industries in the past and could impact our business in the future, resulting in:

•

reduced demand for our services as a result of a decrease in information technology and telecommunications spending by our customers;

•

increased price competition for our products and services; and

•

higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenues.

Recent political turmoil in many parts of the world, including terrorist and military actions, may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.
If the economic and market conditions in the United States and globally do not continue to improve, or if they deteriorate, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition as a consequence of
the above factors or otherwise.

Our limited operating history under our
current business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results.

We have acquired many companies, a number of which operated in different businesses from our then-current business. Therefore, we have only a limited
operating history on which to base an evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects. Our success will depend on many factors, many of which are not entirely under our control, including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the successful integration of acquired companies;

•

the use of the Internet and other Internet Protocol, or IP, networks for electronic commerce and communications;

•

the extent to which digital certificates and domain names are used for electronic commerce or communications;

•

growth in the number of Web sites;

•

growth in wireless networks and communications;

•

growth in demand for our services;

•

the continued evolution of electronic and mobile commerce as a viable means of conducting business;

•

the competition for any of our services;

•

the perceived security of electronic commerce and communications over the Internet and other IP networks;

•

the perceived security of our services, technology, infrastructure and practices;

•

the significant lead times before a new product or service begins generating revenues;

•

the varying rates at which telecommunications companies, telephony resellers and Internet service providers use our services;

•

the success in marketing and overall demand for our content services to consumers and businesses;

•

the loss of customers through industry consolidation, or customer decisions to deploy in-house or competitor technology and services; and

•

our continued ability to maintain our current, and enter into additional, strategic relationships.



To address these risks we
must, among other things:

•

successfully market our services to new and existing customers;

•

attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

•

respond to competitive developments;

•

successfully introduce new services; and

•

successfully introduce enhancements to our services to address new technologies and standards and changing market conditions.

We have faced difficulties assimilating, and may incur costs associated with,
acquisitions.

We made several acquisitions in the last
five years and will pursue additional acquisitions in the future. We have experienced difficulty in, and in the future may face difficulties, integrating the personnel, products, technologies or operations of companies we acquire. Assimilating
acquired businesses involves a number of other risks, including, but not limited to:

•

the potential disruption of our ongoing business;

•

the potential impairment of relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners;

•

the need to manage more geographically-dispersed operations, such as our offices in the states of Kansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, and
Washington, and globally in Australia, Europe, India, Japan, South Africa and South America;

•

greater than expected costs and/or lower than expected revenues and the assumption of unknown liabilities.

•

the diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses in identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions;

•

the inability to retain the key employees of the acquired businesses;

•

adverse effects on the existing customer relationships of acquired companies;

•

our inability to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our operations infrastructure;

•

the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;

•

the potential incompatibility of business cultures;

•

additional regulatory requirements;

•

any perceived adverse changes in business focus;

•

entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience;

•

the need to incur debt, which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, or issue equity securities, which may dilute the ownership interests of our existing
stockholders; and

•

the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies.

If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future acquisitions, our business could be harmed.

Additionally, there is risk that we may incur additional
expenses associated with an impairment of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions for acquisitions. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on
an annual basis and to evaluate other intangible assets as events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired. These evaluations could result in further impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.



The expansion of our international operations subjects our business to additional economic risks that could have an
adverse impact on our revenues and business.

International revenues accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. We intend to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. For example, we
expect to expand our operations and marketing activities throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America and South America. We currently have facilities and over 550 employees in Germany. Expansion in these international markets has required and will
continue to require significant management attention and resources. We may also need to tailor some of our other services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships. We have limited experience in
localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships. We may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets. Failure to do so could harm our business. In addition, there are risks inherent
in doing business on an international basis, including, among others:

•

competition with foreign companies or other domestic companies entering the foreign markets in which we operate;

•

differing and uncertain regulatory requirements;

•

legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with foreign laws;

•

export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

longer sales and payment cycles;

•

problems in collecting accounts receivable;

•

currency fluctuations, as our international revenues from Europe, South Africa, Japan, South America and Australia are not denominated in U.S. Dollars;

•

potential problems associated with adapting our content services to technical conditions existing in different countries;

•

the necessity of developing foreign language portals and products for our content services;

•

difficulty of authenticating customer information for digital certificates and other purposes;

•

political instability;

•

failure of foreign laws to protect our U.S. proprietary rights adequately;

•

more stringent privacy policies in foreign countries;

•

additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting American interests abroad;

•

seasonal reductions in business activity; and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

Our failure to manage past and future growth in our business could harm our business.

Between December 31, 1995 and December 31, 2005, we grew from 26 to 4,076 employees. This was achieved through
internal growth, as well as acquisitions. During this time period, we opened new sales offices and significantly expanded our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. To successfully manage past growth and any future growth, we will need to continue to
implement additional management information systems, continue the development of our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our executive, engineering, accounting, finance,
marketing, sales and operations organizations. Any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business.



The business environment is highly
competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, we may suffer price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.

Competition in Security Services

.    Our security services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for Internet security
services, including network security, authentication and validation, which enable secure electronic commerce and communications over wireline and wireless IP networks. The market for security services is intensely competitive, subject to rapid
change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants.

Principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories: (1) companies such as RSA Security, Inc. and Entrust Technologies, which
offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves; (2) companies such as GeoTrust and Digital Signature Trust Company (a subsidiary of Identrus) that primarily offer digital certificate and
certification authority, or CA, related services; and (3) companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as CyberTrust. We also experience competition from a number of smaller companies, and we believe that our
primary long-term competitors may not yet have entered the market. Furthermore, Netscape and Microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates, and we believe that other companies could
introduce similar products.

In addition, browser companies
that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their Web browsers or on their Web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in
the future.

Competition in Managed Security
Services

.    Consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with Internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services. These companies include large systems
integrators and consulting firms, such as Accenture, IBM Global Services, Getronics and Lucent NetCare. We also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services, such as Symantec and
ISS, as well as a number of providers such as CyberTrust and Counterpane that offer managed security services. Telecommunications providers, such as MCI which acquired NetSec, a provider of managed security services, are also potential competitors.
In addition, we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of IP addresses and name maps throughout enterprise-wide intranets, and with companies with internally developed systems integration efforts.

Competition in Communications
Services.

The market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure. Competition in this area arises from two primary sources. Incumbent carriers provide competing in-house
services in their respective regions. In addition, we face direct competition from national, unregulated companies, including Syniverse Technologies, Telcordia, NeuStar and other carriers such as Southern New England Telephone Diversified Group, a
unit of AT&T. Furthermore, customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers, such as VeriSign, and
further increase competitive pricing pressures.

Competition
in Commerce Services

.    Our wireless billing and payment services also are subject to competition from providers, such as Comverse, Amdocs, Convergys Corporation and Boston Communications Group. We are also aware of major
Internet service providers, software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are or may in the future be focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that may compete directly with ours. Furthermore,
customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as VeriSign and further increase competitive pricing
pressures.

Competition in Content
Services.

The market for content services is extremely competitive. Competitors include developers of content and entertainment products and services in a variety of domestic and international



markets, such as Jamdat Mobile, LaNetro Zed, Infospace, Itouch, Wisdom Entertainment, Arvato mobile, Monstermob, Motricity and Buongiorno/Vitaminic. This
business also faces competition from mobile network operators such as Cingular, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, Vodafone, O


, Orange, E-Plus and Telefónica, as well as Internet portal operators such as Yahoo!, AOL, T-Online and Google. Additional competitors are handset manufacturers such as Nokia and software providers such as Microsoft and Apple.
As the market for wireless data, including information and entertainment data, matures, new categories of competitors, such as mobile phone companies, broadcasters, music publishers, other content providers or others have begun to develop competing
products or services.

Competition in Registry
Services.

ICANN has introduced several registry service providers for new gTLDs that directly compete with the services we provide for the

.com

and

.net

gTLDs, as well as with the ccTLDs offered by us. The
gTLDs

.biz

and

within these gTLDs are available through ICANN accredited registrars. In addition, we currently face competition from the over 240 ccTLD registry operators who compete directly for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to
establish a Web presence.

We also face competition from
service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration, resolutions and other DNS services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure. Among the competitors are UltraDNS, NeuLevel, Affilias, Register.com and
Tucows.com.

Competition in Intelligent Supply Chain
Services.

There are a number of companies that provide intelligent supply chain services. For point-of-sale data, we face competition from IRI and AC Nielsen, as well as smaller software companies. For consulting services,
we face competition from traditional consulting firms.

Competition in Real-Time Publisher Services

.    We face competition from various smaller companies providing similar services.

Competition in Digital Brand Management Services.

We face competition from companies providing
services similar to some of our Digital Brand Management Services. In the monitoring services, registration and domain name asset management area of our business, our competition comes primarily from ICANN accredited registrars and various smaller
companies providing similar services.

Several of our current
and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities,
technologies, standards and customer requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other
means. If such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers, the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our
services would be substantially diminished. New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressure.

New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure. We cannot assure that competing technologies developed by
others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our markets are characterized by announcements of
collaborative relationships involving our competitors. The existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, we may not be able to
compete effectively with current or future competitors, and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business.



Our communications services business
depends in part on the acceptance of our SS7 network and the telecommunications industry’s continuing use of SS7 technology.

Our future growth in our communications services business depends, in part, on the commercial success and reliability of our SS7 network. Our SS7 network
is a vital component of our intelligent network services and has been a significant source of revenues for our Communications Services Group. Our communications services business will suffer if our target customers do not use our SS7 network. Our
future financial performance will also depend on the successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced SS7-based services. We are not certain that our target customers will choose our particular SS7 network solution or
continue to use our SS7 network. In the future, we may not be successful in marketing our SS7 network or any new or enhanced services.

The inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our business.

Significant technical challenges exist in our signaling
and network services business because many of our customers:

•

purchase and implement SS7 network services in phases;

•

deploy SS7 connectivity across a variety of telecommunication switches and routes; and

•

integrate our SS7 network with a number of legacy systems, third-party software applications and engineering tools.

Customer implementation currently requires participation by our order
management and our engineering and operations groups, each of which has limited resources. Some customers may also require us to develop costly customized features or capabilities, which increase our costs and consume a disproportionate share of our
limited customer service and support resources. Also, we typically charge one-time flat rate fees for initially connecting a customer to our SS7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the connection is established. If new or existing
customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our engineering service support, we may experience reduced operating margins. Our customers’ ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and
integrate them successfully within their systems depends on our customers’ capabilities and the complexity involved. Difficulty in deploying those services could reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause
potential delays in recognizing revenues until the services are implemented.

Our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our communications services at desired pricing levels and industry consolidation could adversely impact our revenues and cash flow.

The telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price
competition. Competition and industry consolidation in our communications services could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion in our market share. Pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in the selling price
of our services. For example, our competitors may provide customers with reduced communications costs for Internet access or private network services, reducing the overall cost of services and significantly increasing pricing pressures on us. We
would need to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of our customers, generating higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs, and we may not be able to do so successfully. We believe that the business
of providing network connectivity and related network services will see increased consolidation in the future. Consolidation could decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries, which could erode our market share, revenues and
operating margins in our Communications Services Group. Consolidation in the telecommunications industry has led to the merging of many companies, including AT&T Wireless, MCI, Nextel and Price Communications, customers of our Communications
Services Group. Our business could be harmed if these mergers result in the loss of customers



by our Communications Services Group. Furthermore, customers may choose to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services thereby
reducing the demand for technologies and services we offer which could harm our business.

Our content services business depends on agreements with many different third parties, including wireless carriers, and content providers. If these agreements are terminated or not renewed, or are amended to
require us to change the way our content services are offered to customers, our business could be harmed.

Our content services business depends on our ability to enter into and maintain agreements with many different third parties including:

•

Wireless carriers and other mobile phone service providers, upon which this business is highly dependent for billing its customers; and

•

Developers, music publishers and other providers of content, upon which this business is substantially dependent for content such as ringtones and games.

These agreements are typically for a short term, or are otherwise
terminable upon short notice, and in the case of agreements with carriers, other mobile phone service providers and content developers, are non-exclusive. If these third parties reduce their commitment to us, terminate their agreements with us or
enter into similar agreements with our competitors, our content services business could be materially harmed. For example, because we depend on wireless carriers to bill customers for our services, a loss of any of these relationships, or our
failure to enter into new relationships with additional wireless carriers on commercially reasonable terms, could prevent us from billing and receiving revenues from existing and new customers.

Some wireless carriers have implemented more detailed enrollment procedures
before their customers can purchase content services such as those we offer. Similar enrollment procedures or other requirements affecting content services may be adopted by other wireless carriers or by trade associations seeking to establish
industry-wide standards, and could adversely affect subscriber growth and renewal rates in our content services business.

Our content services business is dependent on third parties offering attractive content and technology on acceptable terms.

Only some of the content used in our content services business is developed
internally. We also receive content, such as ringtones, games and logos from third parties. If the market for mobile entertainment and information continues to grow, content providers might try to raise their prices. Some providers insist on
charging fixed fees for their content regardless of revenues, so if we fail to achieve anticipated revenues, we would achieve lower margins for our content services. There is no assurance that we will be able to timely purchase content having the
requisite quality in the future and on commercially reasonable terms. Should we be unable to acquire attractive content from third parties and on acceptable terms, this could adversely affect our content services business.

Our customer subscription agreements for our content services are typically cancelable and
our business could be harmed if we fail to retain current customers or if we fail to obtain significant numbers of new customers to replace customers who cancel or fail to renew.

Our content services are typically sold as fixed weekly or monthly subscriptions. Our customers for these services may
cancel their subscriptions for our service at the end of each service period and in fact, many customers elect to do so. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, so we cannot accurately predict
customer renewal rates. Our customers’ subscription and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with the service, pricing pressure, changes in preferences and trends,
competitive services, adverse coverage in the news media, changes in the way we advertise our services or other reasons. If our customers cancel or fail to renew their subscriptions for our content services or if we fail to obtain significant
numbers of new customers to replace customers who cancel or fail to renew, our revenue could decline and our content services business will suffer.



Our business depends on the continued
growth of the Internet and adoption and continued use of IP networks.

Our future success depends, in part, on continued growth in the use of the Internet and IP networks. If the use of, and interest in, the Internet and IP networks does not grow, our business would be harmed. To date,
many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the Internet and IP networks for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:

•

potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure;

•

security concerns, particularly for online commerce, including the potential for merchant or user impersonation and fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over
IP networks;

•

privacy concerns, including the potential for third parties to obtain personally identifiable information about users or to disclose or sell data without notice to or the consent of
such users;

•

other security concerns such as attacks on popular Web sites by “hackers”;

•

inconsistent quality of service;

•

inability to integrate business applications on IP networks;

•

the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products;

•

limited bandwidth access; and

•

government regulation.

The widespread acceptance of the Internet and IP networks will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging
information. Organizations that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods. Also, individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting
payments may be reluctant to change.

A number of states, as
well as the U.S. Congress, have been considering various initiatives that could permit sales and use taxes on Internet sales. If any of these initiatives are adopted, it could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and therefore
hinder the growth in the use of the Internet and IP networks, which could harm our business.

Many of our target markets are evolving, and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets, our business could suffer.

We target our security services at the market for trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications over IP and other networks. Our Communications Services Group is targeting the consumer market for content services. Our Information Services business unit is developing managed services designed to work with
the EPCglobal Network and radio frequency identification (“RFID”), technology, point-of-sale data services and real-time publisher services. These are rapidly evolving markets that may not continue to grow. Even if these markets grow, our
services may not be widely accepted. Accordingly, the demand for our services is very uncertain. The factors that may affect market acceptance of our services include the following:

•

market acceptance of products and services based upon technologies other than those we use;

•

public perception of the security of our technologies and of IP and other networks;

•

the introduction and consumer acceptance of new generations of mobile handsets;

•

demand for supply chain information services, including acceptance of RFID technology, the EPCglobal Network and point-of-sale data services;

•

the ability of the Internet infrastructure to accommodate increased levels of usage; and

•

government regulations affecting electronic commerce and communications over IP networks.



If the market for electronic commerce and communications over IP and other networks does not grow or
these services are not widely accepted in the market, our business would be materially harmed.

Governmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth, increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability.

The growth and development of the Internet has led to new laws and
regulations, as well as the application of existing laws to the Internet and wireless communications. Application of these laws can be unclear. The costs of complying or failure to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to
operate in our markets, expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and time-consuming litigation.

Foreign, federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, recent laws include those designed to restrict the on-line
distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions or obligations for on-line services when dealing with minors. Such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to
additional liabilities.

Due to the nature of the Internet, it
is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate Internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws
may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us, force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business.

Our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products
and services could harm our business.

The emerging nature
of the Internet, other communication networks, content, digital certificate, and domain name registration markets, and their rapid evolution, require us continually to improve the performance, features and reliability of our services, particularly
in response to competitive offerings. In particular, the market for entertainment and information is characterized by changing technology, developing industry standards, changing customer preferences and trends (which also vary from country to
country), and the constant introduction of new products and services. In order to remain competitive, we must continually improve our access technology and software, support the latest transmission technologies, and adapt our products and services
to changing market conditions and customer preferences. When entertainment products are placed on the market, it is difficult to predict whether they will become popular.

The communications network services industry is also characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product
and service announcements. Significant technological changes could make our technologies obsolete and other changes in our markets, particularly content, could result in some of our other products and services losing market share. Accordingly, we
must continually improve the responsiveness, reliability and features of our services and develop new features, services and applications to meet changing customer needs in our target markets. For example, we sell our SS7 network services primarily
to traditional telecommunications companies that rely on traditional voice networks. Many emerging companies are providing convergent Internet protocol-based network services. Our future success could also depend upon our ability to provide products
and services to these Internet protocol-based telephony providers, particularly if IP-based telephony becomes widely accepted. We cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost-effective way to
adequately meet them. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share.

New products and services developed or introduced by us may not result in any significant revenues.

We must commit significant resources to develop new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result
in products and services the market will accept. The success of new products and services



depends on several factors, including proper new definition and timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. For example, our selection in January
2004 by EPCglobal, a not-for-profit standards organization, to operate the Object Naming Service as the root directory for the EPCglobal Network, may not increase our revenues in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will
successfully identify new product and service opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services, or that products, services and technologies developed
by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our inability to successfully market new products and services may harm our business.

Issues arising from our agreements with ICANN and the Department of Commerce could harm our registry business.

The Department of Commerce, or DOC, has adopted a plan for a phased
transition of the DOC’s responsibilities for the domain name system to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. As part of this transition, our registry agreement with ICANN was replaced by three new agreements on
May 25, 2001, one for

.com

, one for

.net

and one for

.org

. The term of the

.com

registry agreement extends until November 10, 2007 with a 4-year renewal option. The

.net

registry services were subject to
a competitive bidding process administered by ICANN. Our bid was determined by the outside evaluators selected by ICANN to be the top bid and VeriSign and ICANN have executed a new

.net

registry agreement that extends until September 30,
2011. The

.org

registry agreement terminated on December 31, 2002, and the

.org

registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by ICANN during 2003. We face risks from this transition to ICANN, which
include the following:

•

ICANN could adopt or promote policies, procedures or programs that are unfavorable to our role as the registry operator of the

.com

and

.net

top-level domains or that
are inconsistent with our current or future plans;

•

the DOC or ICANN could terminate our agreements to be the registry for the

.com

or

.net

gTLDs if they find that we are in violation of our agreements with them;

•

if our agreements to be the registry for the

.com

or

.net

top-level domains are terminated, it could have an adverse impact on our business;

•

the DOC’s or ICANN’s interpretation of provisions of our agreements with either of them could differ from ours;

•

the DOC could revoke its recognition of ICANN, as a result of which the DOC would take the place of ICANN for purposes of the various agreements described above, and could take
actions that are harmful to us;

•

the U.S. Government could refuse to transfer certain responsibilities for domain name system administration to ICANN due to security, stability or other reasons, resulting in
fragmentation or other instability in domain name system administration; and

•

our registry business could face legal or other challenges resulting from our activities or the activities of registrars.

On August 27, 2004, we filed a lawsuit against ICANN in the Superior
Court of the State of California County of Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleges that ICANN overstepped its contractual authority and improperly attempted to regulate our business in violation of ICANN’s charter and its agreements with us. We cannot
predict the effect this lawsuit will have on our relationship with ICANN.



Challenges to ongoing privatization of Internet administration could harm our domain name registry business.

Risks we face from challenges by third parties, including
other domestic and foreign governmental authorities, to our role in the ongoing privatization of the Internet include:

•

legal, regulatory or other challenges could be brought, including challenges to the agreements governing our relationship with the DOC or ICANN, or to the legal authority underlying
the roles and actions of the DOC, ICANN or us;

•

Congress has held several hearings in which various issues about the domain name system and ICANN’s practices have been raised and Congress could take action that is
unfavorable to us;

•

ICANN could fail to maintain its role, potentially resulting in instability in domain name system administration; and

•

some foreign governments and governmental authorities have in the past disagreed with, and may in the future disagree with, the actions, policies or programs of ICANN, the U.S.
Government and us relating to the domain name system. These foreign governments or governmental authorities may take actions or adopt policies or programs that are harmful to our business.

As a result of these challenges, it may be difficult for us to introduce new
services in our domain name registry business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted.

If we encounter system interruptions, we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer.

We depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems, secure data
centers and other computer and communication networks. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

•

power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures;

•

damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, and other natural disasters;

•

computer viruses or software defects; and

•

physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.

Most of our systems are located at, and most of our customer information is
stored in, our facilities in Mountain View, California and Kawasaki, Japan, both of which are susceptible to earthquakes, Providence, Rhode Island; Dulles, Virginia; Lacey, Washington; Overland Park, Kansas, Melbourne, Australia and Berlin, Hamburg
and Verl, Germany. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business.

In addition, our ability to issue digital certificates, our domain name registry services and other of our services depend
on the efficient operation of the Internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system. These connections depend upon the efficient operation of Internet service providers and
Internet backbone service providers, all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past.

A failure in the operation of our domain name zone servers, the domain name root servers, or other events could result in the deletion of one or more
domain names from the Internet for a period of time. A failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time. A failure in
the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more top-level domains from the Internet and the discontinuation of second-level domain names in those top-level domains for a period of time. Any
of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction, which could harm our business.



If we experience security breaches, we
could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer.

We retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems. It is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are
perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against
interruption, and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system. The root zone servers and top-level domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations.
Therefore, we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure.

Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers or similar disruptive
problems. It is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems. Any physical or electronic break-in or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers
and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers. In such an event, we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant
to use our services. Such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore, adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over IP networks as well as of the security or
reliability of our services.

The reliance of our network connectivity and
interoperability services and content services on third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control.

The success of our network connectivity and interoperability services and content services depends on our network
infrastructure, including the capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers. In particular, we rely on AT&T, MCI, Sprint and other telecommunications providers for leased long-haul and local loop transmission capacity. These companies
provide the dedicated links that connect our network components to each other and to our customers. Our business also depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect telephone
calls. Specifically, we currently lease capacity from regional providers on six of the 16 mated pairs of SS7 signal transfer points that comprise our network.

We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties
will upgrade or improve their equipment. We depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future,
our operations could be severely interrupted. In addition, rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies. These mergers may cause the availability, pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and
could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services that we use to increase significantly.

Our signaling and SS7 services rely on links, equipment and software provided to us from our vendors, the most important of which are gateway equipment
and software from Tekelec and Agilent Technologies, Inc. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure
product availability with these vendors, we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products and services.

Capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet
increased use.

If traffic from our telecommunication and
content customers through our network increases, we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software. We may not be able to expand and



upgrade, in a timely manner, our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network. If we do not
appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software, we may lose customers and revenues.

We rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route Internet communications.

We currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers.
The others are administered and operated by independent operators on a volunteer basis. Because of the importance to the functioning of the Internet of these root zone servers, our registry services business could be harmed if these volunteer
operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers, which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate.

Further, our registry services business could be harmed if any of these volunteer operators fail to include or provide
accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls. In the event and to the extent that ICANN is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server system, as provided in our registry agreement
with ICANN, it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the top-level domain zone servers designated by us. If ICANN does not do this, our business could be harmed.

Undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results.

Services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain
undetected defects or errors. Despite testing, defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services, which could result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of development
resources, injury to our reputation, tort or warranty claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. The performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects
on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third-party applications and services that utilize our services, which could result in legal claims against us, harming our business. Furthermore, we often provide implementation,
customization, consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services, which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. Our failure or
inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, injury to our reputation and increased costs.

Services offered by our Internet Services Group rely on public key cryptography technology
that may compromise our system’s security.

Services
offered by our Internet Services Group depend on public key cryptography technology. With public key cryptography technology, a user is given a public key and a private key, both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations.
The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and that it is not lost, stolen or otherwise compromised. The integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical
principles known as “factoring.” This integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult. Should an easy factoring method be developed, the security of encryption
products utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing PKI services obsolete or
unmarketable. If improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed, we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers, which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our
business. In the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data. This type of publicity could
also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates. This negative public perception could harm our business.



Some of our security services have
lengthy sales and implementation cycles.

We market many
of our security services directly to large companies and government agencies and we market our communications services to large telecommunication carriers. The sale and implementation of our services to these entities typically involves a lengthy
education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources. This process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers’ internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large
capital expenditures, deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations. As a result, the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain of our services can be lengthy,
potentially lasting from three to nine months. Our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized.

Failure of VeriSign Affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain
the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business.

We have licensed to VeriSign Affiliates our Processing Center platform, which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the
affiliate to offer back-end processing of PKI services for enterprises. The VeriSign Processing Center platform provides a VeriSign Affiliate with the knowledge and technology to offer PKI services similar to those offered by us. It is critical to
our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although we provide the VeriSign Affiliate with training in security
and trust practices, network management and customer service and support, these practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control. Any failure of a VeriSign Affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer
information could result in negative publicity and therefore, adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over IP networks generally.

We rely on our intellectual property, and any failure by us to protect, or any
misappropriation of, our intellectual property could harm our business.

Our success depends on our internally developed technologies, patents and other intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade
secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent U.S. law protects these rights in the United States.
In addition, it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer. In the future, we may have to resort to
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This type of litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs
and diversion of management and technical resources.

We also
license third-party technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions. These third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our business could suffer if
we lost the rights to use these technologies. A third-party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right. Litigation between the licensor and a third-party or between us and a third-party could lead to royalty
obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient, or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or our inability to obtain or maintain, any of
these technology licenses could delay the introduction of our Internet infrastructure services until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. This could harm our business.

We could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others,
which could be costly to defend and which could harm our business.

Claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future. In addition, we use content such as music,



games and logos, as part of our content services, and news content, as part of our real-time publisher service. It is possible that we could become
subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause delays or
require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against
us, we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined. If we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business could be harmed.

In addition, legal standards relating to the validity,
enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. Because of the growth of the Internet and Internet-related businesses, patent applications are continuously and
simultaneously being filed in connection with Internet-related technology. There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest, and we believe that there has been, and is likely to continue to
be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.

We must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships.

One of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger
customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts. We may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan. We may not be able to enter into additional, or maintain our existing, strategic
relationships on commercially reasonable terms. If we fail to enter into additional relationships, we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution, sale and marketing of our security services and communications services than
we would otherwise.

Our success in obtaining results from
these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully.

Furthermore, our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller
channels and to develop multiple distribution channels. Failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business. If we are unable to maintain our
relationships or to enter into additional relationships, this could harm our business.

We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.

We depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, integrate, train,
retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel, both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, our stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel, which consist of background
checks into prospective employees’ criminal and financial histories, further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions.

We have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving VeriSign at any time. In addition, we do not maintain key
person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees. The loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our
business.

Compliance with rules and regulations concerning corporate
governance is costly and could harm our business.

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates, among other things, that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, sets stricter independence and



financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies, their chief executive officers
and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their internal controls. In addition, the NASDAQ
Stock Market has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance. These laws, rules and regulations have increased the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure
practices, and our compliance efforts have required significant management attention. It has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we have been required to accept reduced coverage and
incur substantially higher costs to obtain the reduced level of coverage. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their
duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business.

Regulations related to equity compensation will adversely affect our operating results and negatively impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel.

Since our inception, we have used stock options and other
long-term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options and other long-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through
the use of vesting, encourage employees to remain with VeriSign. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R, “

Share-Based
Payment

,” which supersedes SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

that will require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants beginning in the first quarter of 2006. This
change will have a material, negative impact on our reported earnings. Pro forma compensation expense disclosed in the current and prior years may not be indicative of future compensation expense under SFAS No. 123R. Recording a charge for
employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan under SFAS No. 123 would have increased after tax charges by approximately $115.7 million, $136.8 million and $215.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. In addition, regulations adopted by the NASDAQ Stock Market require stockholder approval for stock option plans and could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future. To the extent that new policies or
regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees, we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, either of which could materially harm our business.

We have anti-takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in
control that could benefit our stockholders.

Our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:

•

our stockholders may take action only at a meeting and not by written consent;

•

our board must be given advance notice regarding stockholder-sponsored proposals for consideration at annual meetings and for stockholder nominations for the election of directors;

•

we have a classified board of directors, with the board being divided into three classes that serve staggered three-year terms;

•

vacancies on our board may be filled until the next annual meeting of stockholders only by majority vote of the directors then in office; and

•

special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the president or the board, and not by our stockholders.



VeriSign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage, delay or prevent a change of
control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult. Under the rights plan:

•

The rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the plan, including the acquisition of 20% of VeriSign’s outstanding common stock by
a person or group.

•

Each right entitles the holder, other than an “acquiring person,” to acquire shares of VeriSign’s common stock at a 50% discount to the then prevailing market price.

•

VeriSign’s Board of Directors may redeem outstanding rights at any time prior to a person becoming an “acquiring person,” at a price of $0.001 per right. Prior to
such time, the terms of the rights may be amended by VeriSign’s Board of Directors without the approval of the holders of the rights.

Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous
foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
We are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical
income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.

On September 7, 2001, NetMoneyIN, an Arizona corporation, filed a complaint alleging patent infringement against VeriSign and several other
previously-named defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona asserting infringement of U.S. patent Nos. 5,822,737 and 5,963,917. NetMoneyIN amended its complaint on October 15, 2002, alleging infringement by
VeriSign and several other defendants of a third U.S. patent (No. 6,381,584) in addition to the two patents previously asserted. On August 27, 2003, NetMoneyIN filed a third amended complaint alleging direct infringement of the same three
patents by VeriSign and several other previously-named defendants. NetMoneyIN dropped its claim of active inducement of infringement by VeriSign. Some of the other current defendants include IBM, BA Merchant Services, Wells Fargo Bank, Cardservice
International, InfoSpace, E-Commerce Exchange and Paymentech. VeriSign filed an answer denying any



infringement and asserting that the three asserted patents are invalid and later filed an amended answer asserting, in addition, that the asserted patents
are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The complaint alleged that VeriSign’s Payflow payment products and services directly infringe certain claims of NetMoneyIN’s three patents and
requested the Court to enter judgment in favor of NetMoneyIN, a permanent injunction against the defendants’ alleged infringing activities, an order requiring defendants to provide an accounting for NetMoneyIN’s damages, to pay NetMoneyIN
such damages and three times that amount for any willful infringers, and an order awarding NetMoneyIN attorney fees and costs. NetMoneyIN has withdrawn its allegations of infringement of the ‘584 patent and the Court has dismissed with
prejudice all claims of infringement of the ‘584 patent. Fact discovery is now closed, and the Court has issued its ruling on the claim construction issues. In its ruling, the Court has found four of the five claims asserted against VeriSign,
claims 1, 13 and 14 of the ‘737 patent and claim 1 of the ‘917 patent, invalid. NetMoneyIN may request reconsideration of this ruling by the Court prior to November 3, 2005, or may file an appeal after a final judgment seeking to
overturn this ruling. Thus, only claim 23 of the ‘737 patent remains in the case. VeriSign and several other defendants have filed motions seeking partial summary judgment of no indirect infringement under 35 U.S.C. Sections 271 b and 271 c
(i.e., no inducement of others to infringe and no contributory infringement). In response to these motions, the plaintiff has filed a motion seeking leave of the Court to amend its complaint to add a new claim of indirect infringement under 35
U.S.C. Section 271 b (inducement) against VeriSign and the other defendants. Briefing on these motions is completed and a hearing has not yet been scheduled by the judge. Expert witness discovery is proceeding. While we cannot predict the
outcome of this lawsuit, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

Beginning in May of 2002, several class action complaints were filed against VeriSign and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. These actions were consolidated under the heading In re VeriSign, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. C-02-2270 JW(HRL), on July 26, 2002. The consolidated action seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a class of persons who purchased VeriSign stock from January 25, 2001 through April 25, 2002. An amended consolidated complaint was
filed on November 8, 2002. On April 14, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended and consolidated complaint. On May 5, 2004, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint
that was substantially identical to the amended consolidated complaint except that it purported to add a claim under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of a subclass of persons who acquired shares of VeriSign
pursuant to the registration statement and prospectus filed October 10, 2001 and amended October 26, 2001 for the acquisition of Illuminet Holdings, Inc. by
VeriSign. Plaintiffs’ second amended class action complaint was dismissed by the court on November 2, 2005 for failure to adequately plead loss causation. Plaintiffs were given leave to file an amended
complaint. Plaintiffs filed a third amended class action Complaint on December 22, 2005. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, which is currently pending.

Parallel derivative actions have also been filed against certain of
VeriSign’s current and former officers and directors in state courts in California and Delaware. VeriSign is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. Several of these derivative actions were filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court of
California and these actions have since been consolidated under the heading In re VeriSign, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case No. CV 807719.

The consolidated derivative action seeks unspecified damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the California Corporations Code.
Defendants’ demurrer to these claims was granted with leave to amend on February 4, 2003. Plaintiffs have indicated their intention to file an amended complaint. Another derivative action was filed in the Court of Chancery New Castle
County, Delaware, Case No. 19700-NC, alleging similar breaches of fiduciary duty. Defendants’ motion to dismiss these claims was granted by the Court of Chancery with prejudice on September 30, 2003.

VeriSign and the individual defendants dispute all of these claims.



On August 27, 2004,
VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN in the Superior Court of the State of California Los Angeles County. The lawsuit alleges that ICANN breached its .com Registry Agreement with VeriSign, including, without limitation, by overstepping its
contractual authority and improperly attempting to regulate our business. The complaint seeks, among other things, specific performance of the .com Registry Agreement, an injunction prohibiting ICANN from improperly regulating VeriSign, and monetary
damages. On November 12, 2004, ICANN filed an answer denying VeriSign’s claims and a cross-complaint against VeriSign for declaratory relief and breach of the .com Registry Agreement, alleging that VeriSign’s introduction of new
services breached the .com Agreement. ICANN seeks a declaration from the court that it has acted in compliance with the parties’ contractual obligations with regard to the .com registry; that VeriSign has breached the parties’ agreement
through VeriSign’s actions with respect to, among other things, SiteFinder; and that ICANN has the right to terminate the .com registry agreement if VeriSign offers “Registry Services” without ICANN’s approval, including among
others SiteFinder. On December 28, 2004, VeriSign filed an answer denying the claims in ICANN’s cross-complaint and a cross-complaint against ICANN for breach of contract, violation of the unfair competition laws, and declaratory relief,
alleging, among other things, that ICANN’s accreditation of “thread” registrars is improper and causes direct injury to VeriSign. On February 14, 2005, ICANN filed an answer to VeriSign’s cross-complaint denying
VeriSign’s allegations.

On or about November 12,
2004, ICANN filed a Request for Arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration (the “ICC”) alleging that VeriSign violated its 2001 .net Registry Agreement with ICANN when, among other things,
VeriSign operated the SiteFinder service without ICANN approval. ICANN seeks a declaration from the ICC that it has acted in compliance with the parties’ contractual obligations with regard to the .net registry; that VeriSign has breached the
parties’ agreement through VeriSign’s actions with respect to, among other things, SiteFinder; and that ICANN has the right to terminate the .net registry agreement if VeriSign offers “Registry Services” without ICANN’s
approval, including among others SiteFinder. ICANN also seeks a declaration that, in evaluating VeriSign’s bid to become the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain after the term of the 2001 agreement expires on
or about June 30, 2005, ICANN is entitled to consider VeriSign’s alleged breaches of the existing agreement. VeriSign cannot predict the outcome of this action or the affect this lawsuit will have on our relationship with ICANN.

On January 18, 2005, VeriSign filed a request for
arbitration before the ICC against ICANN regarding the process by which ICANN solicited and reviewed bids from companies, including VeriSign, to become the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain after the 2001 Registry
Agreement expired on or about June 30, 2005. VeriSign alleges that the “request for proposal” (“RFP”) process constitutes a breach of the 2001 .net registry agreement because, among other things, the RFP process fails to
constitute an open and transparent process by which ICANN can reasonably select the best qualified successor to operate the .net registry and does not constitute a valid “consensus policy” as defined in the 2001 .net agreement. ICANN has
not yet responded to our arbitration request. On June 8, 2005, ICANN announced that it had selected VeriSign as the “successor” registry operator for the .net top level domain, and ICANN and VeriSign have entered into a contract to
confirm that selection. VeriSign anticipates that its selection as the .net registry operator will resolve its request for arbitration.

In October 2005, the Company and ICANN announced a proposed settlement of the various claims between them. The settlement is conditioned upon, among other
things, the execution of a new .com Registry Agreement by both the Company and ICANN and approval of the agreement by the United States Department of Commerce. The proposed agreement has not yet been finally executed or approved. If the settlement
is finalized and implemented, it will result in the dismissal of pending litigation with ICANN.

On February 14, 2005, Southeast Texas Medical Associates, LLP filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, alleging
violations of the unfair competition laws, breach of express warranty and unjust enrichment relating to our Secure Site Pro SSL certificates. The complaint is brought on behalf of a class of persons who purchased the Secure Site Pro certificate from
February 2001 to present. VeriSign disputes these claims. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.



On March 8, 2005, plaintiff Charles Ford filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court
of California, County of San Diego, alleging fraud, negligent misrepresentation, false advertising, and violations of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act and unfair competition laws relating to marketing and advertising of mobile phone
“ringtones” and other content by VeriSign’s subsidiaries, Jamster International Sarl and Jamba! GmbH. The complaint is brought on behalf of classes of persons who responded to advertising by sending a text message on their mobile
phones or registered over the Internet to purchase ringtone or other content. On April 18, 2005, VeriSign removed the action to the federal district court for the Southern District of California. VeriSign disputes the claims in this action.
While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit.

In August, 2005 and October 2005, respectively, VeriSign received two additional similar putative class action lawsuits, one in state court in Arkansas
(short title, Page v. VeriSign), alleging claims for fraud, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and one in federal district court for the Southern District of California (short title, Herrington v.
VeriSign), alleging claims for fraud, negligence and negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, breach of contract, breach of warranty, false advertising, and unfair competition. These lawsuits relate to the marketing and
advertising of mobile phone “ringtones” and other mobile phone content by VeriSign and its subsidiary Jamster International Sarl. VeriSign disputes the claims in these actions. In December 2005, plaintiffs in the Ford and Herrington cases
filed motions with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation seeking to coordinate the Ford, Page, and Herrington actions into a single proceeding for pre-trial purposes. While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, VeriSign believes
the allegations are without merit.

On June 2, 2005, the
company received an access letter from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for information to determine whether VeriSign, using the trade name Jamster, was engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act in its advertising, offering and billing for content services and products. The company also received civil investigative demands from the Illinois State Attorney General (dated June 30, 2005) and from the Florida
State Attorney General (dated October 6, 2005). Each of these letters requested information related to the marketing of Jamster ringtone and other downloadable content services.

On April 11, 2005, Prism Technologies, LLC filed a complaint against VeriSign in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware alleging that VeriSign’s “Go Secure suite of application and related hardware and software products and its Unified Authentication solution and related hardware and software products” infringe U.S. Patent
No. 6,516,416, entitled “Subscription Access System for Use With an Untrusted Network.” Prism Technologies seeks judgment in favor of Prism Technologies, a permanent injunction from infringement, damages in an amount not less than a
reasonable royalty, attorneys’ fees and costs. Prism Technologies has also named RSA Security, Inc., Netegrity, Inc. Computer Associates International, Inc and Johnson & Johnson as co-defendants. VeriSign responded on
June 6, 2005 by filing a counterclaim for declaratory relief and an answer denying any infringement and asserting that the patent is invalid. The Court has not yet scheduled an initial scheduling conference or entered a
scheduling order. The parties currently are engaging in fact discovery. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, VeriSign believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

VeriSign is involved in various other investigations, claims
and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business, none of which, in our opinion will harm its business. VeriSign cannot assure that it will prevail in any litigation. Regardless of the outcome, any litigation may require VeriSign to incur
significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention.

PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Price Range of Common Stock

VeriSign’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ National Market under
the symbol “VRSN.” The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share for our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ National Market:

On February 28,
2006, there were 942 holders of record of our common stock; although we believe there are in excess of 100,000 beneficial owners since many brokers and other institutions hold our stock on behalf of stockholders. On February 28, 2006, the
reported last sale price of our common stock was $23.66 per share as reported by the NASDAQ National Market.

The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and significantly affected by factors such as:

•

general market and economic conditions and market conditions affecting technology and Internet stocks generally;

•

announcements of technological innovations, acquisitions or investments by us or our competitors;

•

developments in Internet governance; and

•

industry conditions and trends.

The market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors.
Reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views. To the extent we have met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations in the past does not necessarily mean that we will be able to do so in the future.

In the past, securities class action lawsuits have often followed periods of
volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock or
other securities and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, for future growth.



Information regarding our equity compensation plans may be found in the section captioned “Equity
Compensation Plan Information” appearing in the definitive Proxy Statement to be delivered to stockholders in connection with the 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders which information is incorporated herein by reference. Further information
regarding our equity compensation plans may be found in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Share Repurchases

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

On April 26,
2001, VeriSign announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million of the Company’s common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase program was completed in the third
quarter of 2005.

On August 2, 2005, the Board of
Directors of VeriSign authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company’s common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. During 2005, a total of 16,495,224 shares were repurchased under
this program for an aggregate cost of approximately $380.3 million.

On November 21, 2005, VeriSign executed an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large investment bank for the acquisition of 10.8 million shares for an initial purchase price of $23.14 per share.
VeriSign acquired these shares as part of its $500 million stock repurchase program authorized on August 2, 2005.

Under the ASR agreement, the investment bank will purchase an equivalent number of shares of common stock in the open market from time to time until it
has acquired that number. At the end of this period, VeriSign may receive, and may be required to remit, a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of its common shares during the period. The purchase price adjustment can be
settled, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of its common stock. The program is subject to a cap that will establish the maximum price per share.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Except for historical information, this Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our anticipated costs and expenses and revenue mix. Forward-looking
statements include, among others, those statements including the words “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “believes” and similar language. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in

we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K that we file in 2006. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.

Overview

VeriSign, Inc. is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services
that enable and protect billions of interactions everyday across the world’s voice and data networks. In 2005 and 2004, our business consisted of two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. Prior
to 2004, our business included an additional reportable segment, the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was sold in November 2003.

Improving economic conditions during 2005 in the U.S., Europe and Japan led to improved IT spending for security services and e-commerce activity in those
markets. We also saw continued growth in domain name registrations and domain name renewals, with active domain names ending in .

com

and .

net

increasing by 30% during 2005. Communication Services Group revenues increased significantly
primarily due to increases in content services revenues during the year. This increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of revenue coupled with significant growth in our content business for the year. Our content business grew in the
second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the comparable periods in 2004; however, revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 due to increased competition, pricing pressures and a decline in the number of
subscribers.

We derive the majority of our revenues and cash
flows from a relatively small number of services sold primarily in the United States, Europe and Japan. In the Internet Services Group, more than 87% of the revenues during 2005 were derived from the sale of registry services, managed authentication
and security services and web certificates. In the Communications Services Group, approximately 89% of the revenues were derived from the sale of content services, signaling services, SS7 connectivity, billing services and calling name services
during the same period.

For the Communications Services Group,
we expect content services revenues to decline in the first quarter of 2006, compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, and expect connectivity, clearing and settlement, and billing-related revenues to be unchanged. Increased competition and continued
consolidation in the telecommunications sector has increased pricing pressures and will continue to have the potential to adversely impact the Communications Services Group’s results. For the Internet Services Group, we expect continued growth
in the levels of IT spending for security services by our customers in the U.S., Europe and Japan and continued growth in domain name registrations and renewals that we believe will result in revenue and deferred revenue growth for the first quarter
of 2006.



Payment Gateway
Business Sale

On November 18, 2005, we completed
the sale of certain assets related to our payment gateway business to PayPal, Inc. and PayPal International Limited for $370 million in cash. This transaction has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No. 144
(“SFAS 144”),

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets”

and, accordingly, we have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all periods to reflect this transaction.

Domain Name Registrar Business Sale

On November 25, 2003, we completed the sale of our Network Solutions
domain name registrar business to Pivotal Private Equity, although we retained a 15% interest in the business. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future, other than revenues that may be recognized in
connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer.

VeriSign Japan K.K.

On November 22, 2004, we sold 18,000 ordinary shares of our Tokyo-based, majority owned consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. (“VeriSign Japan”), representing approximately 7% of our ownership interest, for
approximately $78 million. After giving effect to the sale, we continue to own a majority stake in VeriSign Japan equal to approximately 54% of VeriSign Japan’s total shares outstanding. In the fourth quarter of 2003, VeriSign Japan, completed
an initial public offering of its common stock. Approximately $37.4 million was raised by VeriSign Japan from the initial public offering and through subsequent stock option exercises during the fourth quarter of 2003. VeriSign Japan’s shares
began trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (“TSE”) on November 19, 2003 under the company code 3722.

Acquisitions

In October 2005, we completed our acquisition of Retail Solutions International, Inc. (“RSI”), a Lincoln, Rhode Island-based privately-held
provider of operational point-of-sale data to the retail industry. We paid approximately $23.2 million in cash for all of the outstanding capital stock, vested stock options and assumed unvested stock options of RSI.

In October 2005, we completed our acquisition of Moreover Technologies, Inc.,
a privately held wholesale aggregator of real-time internet content. We paid approximately $29.7 million in cash for all the outstanding capital stock, vested stock options and transaction related expenses of Moreover.

In October 2005, VeriSign Japan completed its acquisition of siteRock K.K., a
Tokyo-based privately held remote network monitoring and outage managing and handling firm. VeriSign Japan paid approximately $53.3 million in cash for siteRock K.K.

In July 2005, we completed our acquisition of iDefense, Inc., a Reston, Virginia-based privately held provider of detailed
intelligence on network-based threats, vulnerabilities and malicious code. We paid approximately $37.8 million in cash for all the outstanding capital stock, vested stock options and certain transaction-related expenses and assumed unvested stock
options of iDefense. Payment of up to $10 million of additional consideration may be made in the future, if additional contractual conditions are met.

In April 2005, we completed our acquisition of LightSurf Technologies, Inc., a Santa Cruz, California-based privately held provider of multimedia
messaging and interoperability solutions for the wireless market. We paid approximately $279 million in common stock for all of the outstanding capital stock, warrants, vested stock options and certain transaction-related expenses and assumed
unvested stock options of LightSurf.



In June 2004, we completed our acquisition of Jamba!, a privately held provider of content services. We
paid approximately $266 million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jamba!, of which approximately $178 million was in cash and the remainder in VeriSign common stock. Also, in June 2004, we acquired the 49% minority interest in
VeriSign Australia for approximately $4.6 million in VeriSign common stock. VeriSign Australia is now a wholly-owned subsidiary.

In February 2004, we completed our acquisition of Guardent, Inc., a privately held provider of managed security services. We paid approximately $135
million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Guardent, of which approximately $65 million was in cash and the remainder in VeriSign common stock.

In addition to the above, we also completed several other acquisitions during 2005, 2004 and 2003 that were not material on an individual basis or in
the aggregate.

We accounted for all of our acquisitions in
2005, 2004 and 2003 as purchase business combinations. Accordingly, the acquired companies’ revenues, costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition. As a result of our sale of the
Network Solutions domain name registrar business in 2003 and our acquisitions during 2005, 2004 and 2003, comparisons of revenues, costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 to the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003 may
not be relevant, as the businesses represented in the consolidated financial statements were not equivalent.

Subsequent events

On January 10, 2006, we completed our accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”) executed on November 21, 2005. The final discounted
volume weighted average price was $22.20. As a result of settling the ASR, we received an additional 482,459 shares of our common stock.

On January 9, 2006, Network Solutions repaid in full all amounts outstanding under the Secured Senior Promissory Note dated November 25, 2003.
In addition, Network Solutions redeemed our 15% equity interest in Network Solutions. We received approximately $50.3 million in total. As a result of the redemption of the membership interests, we no longer own equity interests in any Internet
domain name registrars.

On January 24, 2006, we completed
our acquisition of CallVision, a Seattle-based privately-held provider of online analysis applications for mobile communications customers. We paid approximately $38.2 million in cash for the acquisition.

On February 13, 2006, we entered into a $75 million ASR agreement
with Morgan Stanley & Co., Incorporated (“MSCO”). Under the ASR agreement, we purchased approximately 3.2 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of approximately $23.70. We acquired these shares as part
of our previously announced program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. Under the ASR agreement, MSCO will purchase an equivalent number of shares of common stock in the open
market from time to time until it has acquired that number. At the end of this period, we may receive, and may be required to remit, a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of our common shares during the period. The purchase
price adjustment can be settled, at our election, in cash or in shares of our common stock. The program is subject to a cap that will establish the maximum price per share.

On February 25, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Kontiki, Inc., a Mountain View,
California-based privately-held provider of secure, broadband content delivery services. We have agreed to pay approximately $62.1 million in cash subject to certain closing adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter
of 2006.

On February 28, 2006, we completed our
acquisition of 3united Mobile Solutions ag (“3united”), a Vienna, Austria-based provider of wireless application services, for approximately $69.0 million in cash.



Critical accounting
policies and significant management estimates

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, restructuring, stock-based compensation, royalty liabilities, and deferred income taxes. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial
statements:

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted
accounting principles. Revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which
portions must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided. Our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from
actual events.

Revenues from our consulting services are
recognized using either the proportional performance method or on a time-and-materials basis as work is performed. Proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. We have a
history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and
all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Revenues from time-and-materials contracts are recognized as services are performed.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly
review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customer’s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer. We review significant invoices that
are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above. In addition, we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category. We require all
acquired companies to adopt our credit policies. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future. As
of December 31, 2005, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 4% of total accounts receivable, or approximately $11.6 million. A change of 1% in our estimate would amount to approximately $2.8 million.

Valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles

Our long-lived assets consist primarily of goodwill,
other intangible assets and property and equipment. We review, at least annually, goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

”



We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not
be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

” Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant
decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired
business or use of an asset.

Recoverability of long-lived
assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an
impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005, which was comprised
of $1.1 billion of goodwill and $0.2 billion of other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, technology in place, carrier relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names, and other. Factors we consider
important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or
the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired, an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its
remaining useful life is made. If this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations, of the entity or technology acquired over the
remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material
adverse effect on our reported financial statements. It is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long-lived intangible assets including goodwill.

Restructuring and Other Charges

In November 2003, we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of
our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. In April 2002, we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully rationalize, integrate and align our resources. Both plans resulted in reductions in workforce,
abandonment of excess facilities, disposal of property and equipment and other charges. We expect these restructuring plans to be completed in 2014 upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities. Restructuring charges take
into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space, including the potential for sublease income. Estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented, the rate per
square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property. These estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located, such as the supply of office space
and prevailing lease rates. Changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third-party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis, as necessary. During 2005, we
recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately $0.5 million related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations. Such estimates will likely be revised in the future. If sublease rates continue to change in these
markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional $19.2 million over the next nine years relating to our restructuring plans.

Accounting for Stock-Based Incentive Programs

Through December 31, 2005, we measured compensation expense for our
stock-based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

” Under this method, we did not record
compensation expense when



stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was
granted. We also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the
beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

” and SFAS 148, “

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure,

” we disclosed our pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock-based incentive
programs.

To determine the pro forma impact of applying
SFAS 123, we estimated the fair value of our options using the Black Scholes option valuation model. This model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
This model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our common stock price. The assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in Note 1 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. In the future, we may elect to use different assumptions under the Black Scholes valuation model or a different valuation model, which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or
loss.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
(“SFAS 123R”), “

Share-Based Payment

,” which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such
expense in their consolidated statements of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 and will recognize
stock-based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Although we have not yet determined
whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact
on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share.

Provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights

Certain of our content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others. Where we have not yet entered into a license
agreement with the owner or license holder, we record a provision for royalty payments that we estimate will be due once a license agreement is concluded. We estimate the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of
intellectual property being utilized. Our estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property, such as a
change in demand for a particular type of content, in which case we would record a royalty expense materially different than our estimate.

Income Taxes

We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit
carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. The
recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider past performance, expected future taxable income and prudent feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. Our forecast of
expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated. Changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the U.S. and in
international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income. These changes, if any, may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded.



In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of
uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations. We account for income tax contingencies in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (“SFAS 5”),

“Accounting for Contingencies.”

Results of Operations

Revenues

In 2005 and 2004, we had two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. In 2003, we had three reportable
segments: the Internet Services Group, the Communications Services Group and Network Solutions. As a result of our sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003, we do not recognize revenues from this segment
other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer. A comparison of revenues from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
is presented below.

Internet Services
Group

Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004:

Revenues from our Internet Services Group increased approximately by $117.8 million in 2005, in comparison to 2004, primarily due to the increase in Information Services and Security Services revenues of approximately $62.1 million and $55.7
million, respectively. The Information Services revenue increase was attributed to an increase in the number of active domains ending in

.com

and

.net

under management. The increase in Security Services revenues was primarily due to an
increase in Website digital certificate revenues of $29.2 million and an increase in managed security services and security consulting revenues of $17.2 million.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Internet Services Group revenues increased approximately $117.2 million
in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to increases in Information Services and Security Services revenues of approximately $65.7 million and $51.5 million, respectively. Information Services revenues increased as a result of recognizing
revenues from Network Solutions, that were previously eliminated prior to the sale of the domain name registrar business and as a result of an increase in the number of active domain names ending in

.com

and

.net

under management. The
Security Services revenue increase was due to increases in managed security services and consulting services revenues of $18.5 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of Guardent in February 2004 and increases in Web site digital
certificate revenue of $22.3 million.

The following table
compares active domain names ending in

.com

and

.net

managed by our Information Services business and the approximate installed base of Web site digital certificates in our commerce site services business as of the end of each year

We expect Internet Services
Group revenues will grow in the first quarter of 2006 as demand for domain names as well as the number of installed digital certificates is expected to continue to increase.

Communications Services Group

Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004:

Revenues from our Communications Services Group increased approximately
$373.4 million primarily due to a $377.1 million increase in content services revenues during the year. This increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of revenue in 2005 as compared to the last seven months of 2004 coupled with
significant growth in our content business for the year. The content business grew in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the comparable periods in 2004; however, revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters
of 2005 due to increased competition, pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers. Network services and connectivity revenues increased approximately $7.0 million and clearing, roaming, settlement and intelligent network services
revenues also increased by approximately $10.9 million primarily due an increase in the number of records and transactions cleared. These increases were offset by a decline in billing and payment services of approximately $24.7 million
primarily due to a decline in the customer base and pricing reductions for these services during the year. Intelligent database services revenues were unchanged from 2004 as increases in queries were off-set by price declines in our calling name
(CNAM) service.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Communications Services Group revenues increased approximately $195.6 million primarily due to an increase in content revenues of $180.8 million attributable to our acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004. In addition, intelligent database
services revenues increased approximately $15.0 million primarily due to increases in calling name (CNAM) and local and wireless number portability revenues.

We expect
Communications Services Group revenues to decrease in the first quarter of 2006 principally as a result of continued declines in the number of subscribers in our content business.

Network Solutions

We completed the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003 and recognized no revenues from this segment in
2005 or 2004. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future, other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer.



Revenues by Geographic Region

Our revenues are broken out into three geographic regions consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC. The following table
shows a comparison of our continuing revenues by geographic region for each year presented:

(1)

Canada, Latin America and South America

(2)

Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)

(3)

Australia, Japan and Asia Pacific (“APAC”)

Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004:

Revenues increased approximately $221.8 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the
increase in domain names ending in

.com

and

.net

under management coupled with an increase in the installed base of website digital certificates. Revenues in our EMEA region increased approximately $235.9 million primarily due to
recognizing a full year of revenue from our content business in the region coupled with strong growth in our content business in the first half of 2005. The increase in APAC revenues of approximately $33.5 million was attributed to increased
enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia and increased managed security services revenue in Japan.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Revenues decreased $101.7 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the sale of Network
Solutions in November 2003. Revenues in our EMEA region increased $189.1 million in the same period primarily due to the acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004, which contributed revenues of approximately $180.8 million in 2004. In addition,
increases in our web certificate and managed PKI sales in EMEA also contributed to the increase, partially offset by decreases in our VeriSign Affiliate revenues as we continued to move to a direct distribution model through international
subsidiaries in certain larger European markets. The increase in APAC revenues of $13.6 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily related to increased enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia, partially offset by a decrease
in VeriSign Affiliate revenues.

We expect international
revenues will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to an anticipated decline in content revenues in the EMEA region.

Cost of revenues

Cost of revenues consists primarily of content licensing costs, carrier costs for our SS7 and IP-based networks, costs related to providing digital
certificate enrollment and issuance services, billing services, operational costs for the domain name registration business, customer support and training, consulting and development services, operational costs related to the management and
monitoring of our clients’ network security infrastructures, and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities.

We anticipate that our overall cost of revenues will increase in 2006, but that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will stay flat or
decrease modestly in 2006 primarily due to greater cost efficiencies from our current businesses and recently acquired businesses.



A comparison of cost of
revenues and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below.

Fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004:

Cost of revenues increased approximately $76.2 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $35.6 million in salary and employee benefit costs from increased headcount related to content services and
acquisitions. Contract and professional services increased approximately $25.5 million in 2005, due to increased third-party customer care services, consulting costs for billing services and service development costs for prepaid services. Retailer
commissions related to content services increased approximately $7.4 million over 2004. Other increases in cost of revenues were related to cost of maintenance of equipment and software.

As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily from leveraging our existing
capital equipment and service delivery platforms. Overall depreciation expense on our new and existing equipment was unchanged in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Cost of revenues decreased approximately $3.1 million primarily due a decrease of $69.5 million as a
result of the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was offset by increases attributable to the acquisitions of Jamba! and Guardent of $49.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively.

As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased primarily due to the
sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was a business with higher costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue than our other business segments.

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales, marketing, and policy activities. These expenses include salaries, sales
commissions, sales operations and other personnel-related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees and costs
of marketing programs, such as Internet, television, radio, print, and direct mail advertising costs.

We expect overall sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues to decrease as we expect to optimize our advertising
expenses in certain countries for our content services. Efforts in marketing new products such as Unified Authentication and related services will continue in the first quarter of 2006.

A comparison of sales and marketing expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 is presented below.



Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004:

Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately
$238.8 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $204.1 million relating to advertising, marketing and promotional expenses for our content and application services business. Salary and employee benefits increased approximately
$30.0 million due to an increase in overall sales and marketing headcount. Increase in corporate brand advertising, including the re-launch of our brand, and corporate marketing amounted for approximately $4.4 million.

As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased in 2005
compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing spending in our content and application services business in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $54.4 million
primarily due to our acquisitions of Jamba! and Guardent, which had sales and marketing expenses of $80.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively, that were partially offset by a decrease of $38.3 million in sales and marketing expenses due to
the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business. Additionally, we experienced an increase of approximately $7.1 million in advertising and marketing costs during this period primarily as a result of increased corporate brand
advertising.

As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing
expenses increased in 2004 due to the increase in advertising and marketing spending, as described above.

Research and development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related
expenses, consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development.

We believe that rapid development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our leadership position in the marketplace.
Accordingly, we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and
increase modestly as a percentage of revenues in 2006.

A
comparison of research and development expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below.

Fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004:

Research and development expenses increased approximately $34.9 million primarily due to an increase in headcount from our acquisitions, resulting in an increase of approximately $26.5 million in salary and
employee related benefit costs. Other increases included approximately $3.3 million in occupancy related costs related to acquisitions and approximately $2.0 million of costs related to outside services.

As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased due
to the increase in overall spending in 2005 compared to 2004.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Research and development expenses increased $11.0 million primarily due to our acquisitions of Guardent and Jamba!. Research and development spending attributable to these acquired entities
was $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The sale of our Network Solutions



business had no material effect on our research and development expense. Additionally, we experienced an increase of approximately $4.1 million in increased
costs associated with contract and professional services to support new and existing research and development efforts.

As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2004 as compared to 2003.

General and administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other
personnel-related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, facilities, computer and communications equipment, management information systems, support services, professional
services fees, certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense.

We anticipate that general and administrative expenses in 2006 will increase marginally in absolute dollars and as a percentage of overall revenues.

A comparison of general and administrative expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below.

Fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004:

General and administrative expenses increased approximately $30.6 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $18.4 million in salary and employee benefit costs as a result of increased headcount. Equipment
and software related expenses increased approximately $7.4 million, primarily due to an increase in hardware maintenance costs, software licenses and depreciation expense. Legal costs increased approximately $3.1 million primarily due to litigation
settlements during the year. Contract and professional services increased approximately $3.1 million primarily due to services related to audit, tax and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other corporate
expenses.

As a percentage of revenues, general and
administrative expenses decreased primarily due to increased revenues from our content services business, which has lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than other businesses, coupled with our ability to leverage
existing general and administrative costs.

Fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003:

General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $9.1 million, primarily due to a decrease of $9.8 million attributable to the sale of our Network Solutions business, partially offset by increases in
general and administrative expenses from our acquisitions.

Excluding the effects of the acquisitions of Guardent and Jamba! and the sale of our Network Solutions business, the overall decrease in general and administrative costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 was $13.3 million. This was primarily due
to a reduction in costs from prior restructuring efforts of approximately $20.8 million, along with other efficiencies from cost reduction efforts of $5.6 million and a decrease in our bad debt expense of approximately $5.4 million. These decreases
were partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately $11.0 million as a result of costs associated with litigation, and increases in contract and professional services of approximately $7.5 million primarily due to expenses related
to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.

As a percentage of revenues,
general and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2004 as described above.



The following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense and our days sales outstanding
(“DSO”) for 2005, 2004 and 2003:

DSO increased in 2005
as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of our acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004. We expect that DSO will be in the range of 40 to 50 days throughout 2006.

Restructuring and Other Charges

Below is a comparison of the restructuring and other charges for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003:

The changes in
restructuring and other charges are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives.

2003 Restructuring Plan

.    In 2003, we announced a restructuring initiative related to the sale of our Network Solutions
business and the realignment of other business units and recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately $54.2 million. During 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.7 million related to non-cancelable lease costs for excess
facilities, $1.1 million related to workforce reduction charges, $1.0 million for exit costs and $0.2 million for other charges relating to property and equipment write-offs. During 2005, we recorded reversals to excess facilities of approximately
$1.9 million relating to certain operating leases.

Restructuring Plan

.    In 2002, we announced plans to restructure our operations to rationalize, integrate and align resources. In 2003, we recorded other charges of $9.2 million related to the write-off of certain computer
software. We also recorded restructuring charges of $8.7 million related to non-cancelable lease costs for excess facilities, $1.5 million related to workforce reduction charges and $1.0 million of exit costs. In 2005, we recorded charges of
approximately $1.4 million relating to excess facilities that were either abandoned or downsized due to lease terminations and non-cancelable lease costs.

Other charges.

During 2004, we recorded other charges of approximately $20.1 million relating to certain asset write-offs.
During 2005, we abandoned the development efforts related to an internally developed software project and recorded an expense of approximately $21.6 million to other charges.

Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

Below is a comparison of our amortization and impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003:



SFAS No. 142 requires
that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset.

There was no impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment tests conducted in June 2005 and 2004.

The annual impairment test conducted in June 2003 resulted in an impairment
charge to goodwill and other intangible assets of $123.2 million during the second quarter of 2003. We recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of entering into an agreement to sell our
Network Solutions business. The event triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to Network Solutions. After considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the
divestiture, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the implied fair value of Network Solutions’ goodwill. Total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as allocated to our operating segments for the year ended
December 31, 2003 are as follows:

Fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004:

Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $22.2 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of Jamba! in June of 2004 and
amortization expense related to our acquisition of LightSurf in April of 2005. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from Jamba! accounted for approximately $10.2 million of the increase. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from
LightSurf accounted for approximately $8.8 million of the increase.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Amortization of other intangible assets decreased approximately $102.3 million as other intangible assets related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized.

See Notes 1 and 7 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.

Acquired in-process research and
development

During 2005, we wrote off $7.7 million of
in-process research and development acquired in the purchase of LightSurf, iDefense, Moreover and RSI. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated with the IPR&D efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research
and development in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies.

Minority interest

Minority interest represents the portion of net income belonging to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries.

Fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004:

Minority interest increased primarily from increased net income from our VeriSign Japan subsidiary primarily due to an increase in the installed base of website security certificates and increased demand for managed
security services in Japan.

Fiscal 2004 compared to
fiscal 2003:

Minority interest increased in primarily from increased net income from our VeriSign Japan subsidiary. In June 2004, we acquired the remaining 49% minority interest in VeriSign Australia, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Other income (expense), net

Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash
equivalents, and investments, gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments, and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses.

The following table presents the components of other income, net for years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004:

Other income decreased approximately $33.2 million primarily due to the gain on sale of VeriSign Japan of approximately $74.9 million recorded in 2004, partially offset by an increase in realized gains on
investments, net of losses and impairments, in 2005, of approximately $19.5 million. Interest income increased $11.7 million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances and slightly higher interest rates during 2005. In addition, we recorded
a gain of approximately $6.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute with a telecommunications carrier customer during 2005.

Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003:

Other income increased approximately $92.5 million primarily due to the gain on sale of VeriSign Japan.
Interest income increased approximately $10.4 million primarily due to higher cash balances.

Income tax expense

In the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or 43.0% of pretax income, $20.4 million, or 10.5% of pretax income, and $18.2 million, or (7.3)% of
pretax loss, respectively. Our effective tax rates differ from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state taxes, acquisition-related expenses, the realization of domestic net operating loss, capital loss, and research
credit carryforwards, and the impact of foreign operations.



In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors, including our
past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to U.S. federal and state operations are
realizable. However, depending on our continued ability to achieve profitability, and on the potential impact of SFAS 123R, we may have sufficient evidence in 2006 to conclude that realization of additional deferred tax assets is more likely than
not and thus realize a tax benefit in that period from a reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.

If the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets were released as of December 31, 2005, approximately $237.7 million would be credited to
the statement of operations, and $101.2 million would be credited to additional paid-in capital. Management would continue to apply a valuation allowance of $55.8 million to the deferred tax asset relating to the write-down of investments, due to
the limited carryover life and character of such tax attributes. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that $8.3 million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable; therefore, a valuation allowance
is applied to the deferred tax asset. On the remaining foreign operations, management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized; accordingly, a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets.

As of December 31, 2005, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $231.4 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $242.5 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $31.1 million. If we are not able to use them, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2023 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2006 through 2023. Most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire, but could be subject to future restrictions based on
changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary. We had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately $7.0 million available for carryover to future years, and for state income tax purposes
of approximately $3.8 million available for carryover to future years. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2010 through 2025. State research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely
until utilized.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial
restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. We experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50 percent in 2003
and 2002. These changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize U.S. Federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards of $232.9 million and $116.5 million, respectively. Losses not utilized
due to these limitations can be carried forward, but are subject to the expiration dates described in the prior paragraph.

In the consolidated balance sheets, we have not included deferred tax assets of $151.1 million for a capital loss carryforward, and
$67.0 million for a net operating loss generated by stock options. The capital loss and the net operating loss generated by the stock options are each subject to a ruling request currently on file with the IRS and will be allowed if and when we
receive a favorable ruling. If the IRS issues favorable rulings to us, the deferred tax assets could be recognized and, if recognized, the $151.1 million will be credited to income tax expense and the $67.0 million will be credited to
additional paid-in capital. The outcome of these ruling requests is uncertain as the rulings are solely dependent on the IRS’ discretion.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31,
2005, our principal source of liquidity was $854.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting principally of commercial paper, medium term investment-grade corporate notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and
agency securities and money market funds.

Net cash provided
by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $510.8 million in 2005 primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for non-cash items such as amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of property and equipment. Additionally, cash flows from
operating activities increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to an increase in deferred revenues of $72.8 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $100.3 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable
of $63.8 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities
was $365.3 million in 2004 primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for non-cash items such as amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of property and equipment. Additionally, cash flows from operating
activities increased during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to an increase in deferred revenues of $69.3 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $44.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of
$65.8 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$358.4 million in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable of $38.1 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $28.0 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $25.5 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other
current assets of $12.8 million after accounting for the sale of our Network Solutions business.

Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash provided by investing activities was $113.9 million in 2005, primarily as a result of net proceeds of $367.2 million from the sale of our payment
gateway business, partially offset by $161.3 million used for our acquisitions and $140.5 million for purchases of capital equipment. Other increases in cash were from net proceeds of investments of approximately $37.0 million and a $16.0 million
payment on a long-term note receivable.

Net cash used in
investing activities was $284.9 million in 2004, primarily as a result of $253.8 million used for our acquisitions and $15.9 million used for net purchases of investments. In addition, we used approximately $92.5 million for purchases of property
and equipment, partially offset by $78.3 million in proceeds from the sale of stock in our VeriSign Japan subsidiary.

Net cash used in investing activities was $368.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of $292.8 million used for net purchases of investments, $108.0
million for purchases of property and equipment, and $21.2 million for our acquisitions. These purchases were partially offset by proceeds of $57.6 million of cash received from the sale of our Network Solutions subsidiary in November 2003.



Net cash used in
financing activities

Net cash used in financing
activities was $469.5 million in 2005 primarily due to $548.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market under an existing repurchase program, partially offset by $80.5 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of
common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases.

Net cash used in financing activities was $54.5 million in 2004 primarily due to $113.3 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market under an existing repurchase program, partially offset
by $62.4 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $55.9 million in 2003 primarily due to $37.4 million of cash was provided as a result of VeriSign
Japan’s initial public offering of common stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 and through subsequent option exercises. Additionally, in 2003, $31.7 million was provided by common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises and
proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan partially offset by $13.2 million for the repayment of debt and other long-term obligations.

Net cash provided by discontinued operations

Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was primarily from net income related to our discontinued
payment gateway business of $16.1 million, $12.6 million and $8.0 million respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was approximately $1.5 million and $2.8 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily for purchases of property and equipment.

Capital property and equipment expenditures

expenditures will be focused on productivity, cost improvement and market development initiatives for the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. Other capital property and equipment expenditures will be for productivity and
cost improvement initiatives for corporate services.



Contractual obligations

The following table summarizes our significant non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2005, and the
effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

As of
December 31, 2005, we had commitments under non-cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Future operating lease payments include payments related to leases on excess
facilities included in our restructuring plans. The restructuring liability is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs. Amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the
respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through 2014. If sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an
additional $19.2 million over the next nine years relating to our restructuring plans. Cash payments totaling approximately $39.6 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next nine years. See Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans, not including other cost savings efforts, were estimated to have been approximately $25 to $30 million in 2005 and are estimated to be approximately the same in
2006.

In November 1999, we entered into an agreement for the
management and administration of the Tuvalu Internet top-level domain,

“.tv”

with the Government of Tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to $6.2 million through 2008.

We have pledged a portion of our short-term investments as collateral for
standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations, primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements. We have pledged approximately $6.0 million pursuant to such agreements classified as restricted cash and
investments on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we established a trust during the first quarter of 2004 in the amount of $45.0 million classified as restricted cash and investments on our balance sheet for
our director and officer liability self-insurance coverage.

To
facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with
third parties.

On November 21, 2005, we entered into a
$250 million ASR agreement with a large investment bank. Under the ASR agreement, we purchased approximately 10.8 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of approximately $23.14.

On August 2, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock
repurchase program to use up to $500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2005, 16,495,224 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $380.3 million. At December 31,
2005, approximately $119.7 million remained available for future repurchases under this program.



In 2001, our Board of
Directors authorized the use of up to $350 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2005, 6,322,203 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $167.0 million. We completed the
2001 stock repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005.

In
October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices, with a total public
offering price not to exceed $750 million. To date, no shares have been issued under this registration statement.

If we liquidated certain available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2005, we would have recognized losses of approximately $5.4 million in our
statement of operations. Instead, these unrecognized losses, partially offset by unrecognized gains, are recorded as a separate component of equity and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.

We believe existing cash and short-term investments, together
with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses, acquisitions, and share repurchases. We regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view
of our current and potential future needs.

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

,” which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 and will recognize stock-based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer
will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See “

Stock Compensation Plans and Unearned Compensation

” in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pro forma net
income (loss) and net income (loss) per share amounts, for 2003 through 2005, as if we had used a fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although
we have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a
significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-1 (“FSP 109-1”), “

Application of FASB Statement No. 109

,
“

Accounting for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

.” The AJCA introduces a special 9% tax deduction on qualified production activities. FAS
109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with SFAS 109. Pursuant to the AJCA, we will not be able to claim this tax benefit until the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We do not expect the
adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-2 (“FSP 109-2”), “

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004

.” The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation
provision), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109-2 provides accounting and



disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. We do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 (“SFAS 154”), “

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”

which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 “

Accounting Changes”

and SFAS No. 3, “

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements—An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28”

. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a
voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the
Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The impact that the adoption of SFAS 154 will have on our results of operations and financial position will depend on the nature of future accounting changes adopted by VeriSign and the nature of
transitional guidance provided in future accounting pronouncements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Equity investments

We invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes. In most instances, we invest in the equity and debt securities of
private companies for which there is no public market, and therefore, carry a high level of risk. These companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near-term. Therefore, these
companies may never become publicly traded. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we determined the decline in value of
certain public and non-public equity investments was other-than-temporary and we recognized impairments totaling $0.8 million, $12.6 million, and $17.0 million, respectively. Due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments, we may
incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments.

Interest
rate sensitivity

The primary objective of our cash
management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after-tax returns. Some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to interest rate risk. This means that a
change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later
rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value. To minimize interest rate risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including
commercial paper, medium-term notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates
with the prevailing interest rate. As of December 31, 2005, 45% of our investments subject to interest rate risk mature in less than one year. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at
December 31, 2005, this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio.



The following table presents
the amounts of our cash equivalents and short-term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2005. This table does not include money market funds
because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk.

Foreign exchange risk management

We conduct business throughout the world and transact in
multiple foreign currencies. As we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to
mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non-functional currencies. The primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from
fluctuations in exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The
program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months.

At December 31, 2005, we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately $173.2 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. All forward contracts are recorded at fair market value. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high-quality financial institutions.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Financial Statements

VeriSign’s financial statements required by this item are set forth as a separate section of this Form 10-K. See Item 15 (a)1 for a listing of
financial statements provided in the section titled “Financial Statements.”

Supplemental Data (Unaudited)

The following
tables set forth unaudited quarterly supplementary data for the two-year period ended December 31, 2005 and 2004:



(1)

Net income (loss) per share is computed independently for each of the quarters represented in accordance with SFAS No. 128. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net income
(loss) per share may not equal the total computed for the fiscal year or any cumulative interim period.

(2)

Results include a $1.9 million credit for net restructuring charge and $0.9 million of realized gains on investments, net of impairments.

(3)

Results include a $0.1 million credit for net restructuring charges and $0.1 million of investment impairments, net of realized gains.

(4)

Results include a $0.5 million restructuring charge in connection with workforce reductions, closures of excess facilities, disposal of abandonment of property and equipment, exit
costs and other charges and $8.2 million of realized gains on investments, net of impairments.

(5)

Net income for 2005 includes gain on sale of discontinued operations of $251.8 million, and other charges of approximately $21.6 million related to the abandonment of the
development efforts related to an internally developed software project.

(6)

Results include a $15.5 million restructuring charge in connection with workforce reductions, closures of excess facilities, disposal of abandonment of property and equipment, exit
costs and other charges and $3.3 million of investment impairments, net of realized gains.

(7)

Results include a $3.6 million credit for net restructuring charges and $0.3 million of investment impairments, net of realized gains.

(8)

Results include a $7.7 million restructuring charge in connection with workforce reductions, closures of excess facilities, disposal of abandonment of property and equipment, exit
costs and other charges and $4.6 million of investment impairments, net of realized gains.

(9)

Results include a $5.2 million restructuring charge in connection with workforce reductions, closures of excess facilities, disposal of abandonment of property and equipment, exit
costs and other charges, and a $74.9 million gain related to the sale of stock in our VeriSign Japan subsidiary.

Our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results
will not necessarily be meaningful, and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Also, operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future
quarters. If this were to occur, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. For more information regarding the quarterly fluctuation of our revenues and operating results, see the section captioned “Risk Factors—Our
operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain.”

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as of December 31, 2005, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in this report was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms for this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within VeriSign have been detected.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As required
under Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the consolidated financial statements of VeriSign are provided in this separate section. The consolidated financial statements included in this section are as follows:



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

VeriSign, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that VeriSign, Inc. (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management’s assessment that VeriSign, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, VeriSign, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

VeriSign, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting of VeriSign, Inc. as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1.    Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

VeriSign, Inc. (“VeriSign” or “the Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services
that enable and protect billions of interactions everyday across the world’s voice and data networks. Through the Company’s Internet Services Group and Communications Services Group, VeriSign offers a variety of internet and
communications-related services, including internet security services, information services, network connectivity and interoperability services, intelligent database services, content and application services, clearing and settlement services, and
billing and payment services. VeriSign markets its products and services through its direct sales force, telesales operations, member organizations in its global affiliate network, value-added resellers, service providers, and its Web sites.

VeriSign is currently organized into two reportable
service-based segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. The Internet Services Group consists of the Security Services business and the Information Services business. The Security Services business provides products
and services that enable enterprises and service providers to establish and deliver secure Internet-based services to customers, and the Information Services business acts as the exclusive registry of domain names in the

.com

and

.net

generic top-level domains, or gTLDs, and certain country code top-level domains, or ccTLDs. The Communications Services Group provides network connectivity and interoperability services, intelligent data base services, content and application
services, and billing and payment services to telecommunications carriers and other users. During 2003, VeriSign derived its revenues from three reportable segments, the two described above, and the Network Solutions business segment, through which
VeriSign provided domain name registration, and value added services such as business email, websites, hosting and other web presence services. Effective November 25, 2003, VeriSign completed the sale of its Network Solutions business to
Pivotal Private Equity and realigned its operations into the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VeriSign and its subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts
and transactions. On June 17, 2004, VeriSign acquired the 49% minority interest in VeriSign Australia Limited, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2005, VeriSign owned approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of its consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. The minority interest’s proportionate share of income is included in minority interest in the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in VeriSign’s proportionate share
of the net assets of VeriSign Japan K.K. resulting from sales of capital stock by the subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions. VeriSign accounted for the November 2005 sale of its payment gateway business as a discontinued operation in
accordance with SFAS No. 144 (“SFAS 144”),

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets”

. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to
reflect its payment gateway business as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in the notes to consolidated financial statements pertain to continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

The discussion and analysis of VeriSign’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosures of



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for
doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, restructuring, stock-based compensation, royalty liabilities, and deferred taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

VeriSign considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, commercial paper and various deposit accounts.

Short-Term Investments

Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months are considered short-term investments. VeriSign invests in debt and
equity securities of companies for business and investment purposes.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair
value of VeriSign’s cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, restricted cash and investments, accounts payable and other long-term liabilities approximates the carrying amount, which is the amount for which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.

Long-Term Investments

Investments in
non-public companies where VeriSign owns less than 20% of the voting stock and has no indicators of significant influence are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for under the cost method. For these
non-quoted investments, VeriSign regularly reviews the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information provided by these privately held companies. This information may be more limited, may not be as
timely, and may be less accurate than information available from publicly traded companies. Assessing each investment’s carrying value requires significant judgment by management. Generally, if cash balances are insufficient to sustain the
investee’s operations for a six-month period and there are no anticipated prospects of future funding for the investee, VeriSign considers the decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary. If it is determined that an other-than-temporary
decline exists in a non-public equity security, VeriSign writes down the investment to its fair value and records the related impairment as an investment loss in its consolidated statement of operations. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, VeriSign
determined that the decline in value of certain of its non-public equity investments was other-than-temporary and recorded impairments of these investments totaling $0.8 million, $12.6 million, and $17.0 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, long-term investments totaling $6.7 million and $6.8 million have been included in other assets on the respective consolidated balance sheets.

Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally
do not include finance charges. VeriSign maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. VeriSign regularly reviews the adequacy of its accounts receivable
allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customer’s expected ability to pay



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

and its collection history with each customer. VeriSign reviews significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on
the risk category using the factors described above. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, VeriSign maintains general reserve provisions based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these reserves, VeriSign analyzes its historical
collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data VeriSign uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful
accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 40 years for buildings and three to five years for computer
equipment, purchased software, office equipment, and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease terms.

Capitalized Software

Costs incurred in connection with the development of software products are
accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 86, “

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed.

” Development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products, and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model
has been established. VeriSign’s software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility, and accordingly no such costs have been capitalized.

Software included in property and equipment includes amounts paid for
purchased software and implementation services for software used internally that has been capitalized in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 98-1,
“

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

”. The following table summarizes the capitalized costs related to third party implementation and consulting services as well as costs related to
internally developed software:

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of costs
over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least
annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

” As of December 31, 2005, there were no other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. SFAS No. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

.”



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles
subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant
decrease in the fair value of the underlying business, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business, difficulties or delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of an acquired business.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Goodwill and acquired intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment, and are tested for impairment more frequently if
events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized when its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value as defined by SFAS No. 142. For acquired intangible assets not subject to
amortization, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights

Certain of VeriSign content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others. Where VeriSign has
not yet entered into a license agreement with a holder, VeriSign records a provision for royalty payments that it estimates will be due once a license agreement is concluded. VeriSign estimates the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty
rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized. VeriSign’s estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such
intellectual property, such as a change in demand for a particular type of content, in which case VeriSign would record a royalty expense materially different than its estimate.

Foreign Currency Translation

VeriSign conducts business throughout the world and transacts in multiple currencies. The functional currency for most of
VeriSign’s international subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are remeasured into U.S. Dollars using a combination of current and historical exchange rates and any remeasurement gains and losses are
included in operating results.

The financial statements of the
subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using the current rate for assets and liabilities and a weighted-average rate for the period for revenues and expenses. This translation results in
a cumulative translation adjustment that is included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

VeriSign maintains a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with
the monetary assets and liabilities of its operations that are denominated in non-functional currencies. The primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company does not
enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor does it hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The program may entail the use of forward or
option contracts, and in each case, these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

At December 31, 2005, VeriSign held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately
$173.2 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. All forward contracts were recorded at fair market value on the balance sheet and gains and losses were included in earnings at year end
2005 and 2004. Notional amounts of forward contracts approximated the fair market values as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company attempts to limit its exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high-quality
financial institutions.

Revenue Recognition

VeriSign derives its revenues from two reportable segments: (i) the
Internet Services Group, which consists of Security Services and Information Services; and (ii) the Communications Services Group, which consists of Network Connectivity and Interoperability Services, Intelligent Database Services, Content and
Application Services, Clearing and Settlement Services, and Billing and Payment Services. Unless otherwise noted below, VeriSign’s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,
“

Revenue Recognition,

” and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 00-21, “

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

”

The revenue recognition policy for each of these categories is as follows:

Internet Services Group

Security Services

Revenues from the Security Services business are comprised of security services including managed security services and authentication services for
enterprises.

Managed Security Services
(“MSS”).

Revenues from managed security services primarily consist of a set-up fee and a monthly service fee for the managed security service. Revenues from set-up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over
the period that the fees are earned and revenues from the monthly service fees are recognized in the period in which the services are provided.

VeriSign also provides global security consulting services to help enterprises assess, design, and deploy network security solutions. Revenues from global
security consulting services are recognized either on a time and materials basis as the services are performed, or for fixed price consulting as services are performed, completed and accepted. In some cases fixed price consulting is measured using
the proportional performance method of accounting. Proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. VeriSign has a history of accurately estimating project status and the
hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the
project was completed. Revenues from time-and-materials are recognized as services are performed.

Authentication Services.

Revenues from the sale of authentication and security services primarily consist of a set-up fee,
annual managed service and per seat license fee. Revenues from the fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license, generally 12 to 36 months. Post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is bundled with authentication and
security services licenses and recognized over the license term.

VeriSign Affiliate PKI Software and Services.

VeriSign Affiliate PKI Software and Services are for digital certificate technology and business process technology. Revenues from the VeriSign Affiliate PKI
Software and Services are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including PCS and other services. These software licenses, which do not provide for right of return, are primarily perpetual licenses for which revenues are recognized
up-front once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

VeriSign recognizes revenues from VeriSign Affiliate PKI Software and Services in accordance with
SOP 97-2, “

Software Revenue Recognition,

” as amended by SOP 98-9, “

Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Transactions

,” when all of the following criteria are met:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is probable. VeriSign defines each of these four criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.

It is the Company’s customary practice to have a written contract, which is signed by both the
customer and VeriSign, or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with VeriSign.

•

Delivery has occurred.

VeriSign’s software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer. Electronic delivery is deemed to
have occurred upon download by the customer from an FTP server. Where an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product, delivery is not considered to have occurred until these
products or services are delivered or accepted.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable.

It is VeriSign’s policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of their paid license
fees. Generally, at least 80% of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less, but VeriSign may agree to payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs. Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment
terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable, and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable.

•

Collectibility is probable.

Collectibility is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. VeriSign typically sells to customers for whom there is a
history of successful collection. New customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customer’s financial position and, ultimately, their ability to pay. If VeriSign determines from the outset of an arrangement that
collectibility is not probable based upon its credit review process, revenues are recognized as cash is collected.

The Company’s determination of fair value of each element in multiple-element software arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence
(“VSOE”) of fair value. VeriSign limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately. VeriSign has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple-element software arrangements
and determined that it has sufficient VSOE to allocate revenues to PCS and professional services components of its perpetual license arrangements. VeriSign sells its professional services separately, and has established VSOE on this basis. VSOE for
PCS is determined based upon the customer’s annual renewal rates for these elements. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method
in accordance with SOP 98-9.

VeriSign’s consulting
services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software. The Company’s software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration. Customers purchase these consulting
services to facilitate the adoption of VeriSign’s technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed, but customers may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to
provide these services. Software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services, which are generally billed on a time-and-materials or milestone-achieved basis.

VeriSign also receives ongoing royalties from each digital certificate or authentication service sold by the VeriSign
Affiliate to an end user. The Company recognizes the royalties from affiliates over the term of the digital certification or authentication service to which the royalty relates, which is generally 12 to 24 months.

carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. VeriSign records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not.

Stock Compensation Plans and Unearned Compensation

As of December 31, 2005, VeriSign has four stock-based employee compensation plans, including two terminated plans under which options are
outstanding but no further grants can be made, and two active plans. VeriSign accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.”

The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share if VeriSign had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,

” to stock-based employee compensation:

On December 29,
2005, the Board of Directors of VeriSign approved the acceleration of the vesting of unvested and “out-of-the-money” stock options that had an exercise price per share in excess of $24.99, all of which were previously granted under
VeriSign’s stock option plans and that were outstanding on December 29, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 8.8 million shares of common stock or 47% of our total outstanding unvested options on December 29, 2005 were subject
to the acceleration. The options accelerated included certain options previously granted to executive officers and directors of VeriSign.

The acceleration was accompanied by restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options. Those restrictions will
prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date (whether or not the optionee is actually an employee at that time).



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

The purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to reduce compensation expense
associated with these options in future periods, beginning with the first quarter of 2006, in its consolidated financial statements, pursuant to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (“SFAS 123R”),

“Share-Based Payment”

issued by FASB in December 2004. As a result of the acceleration, VeriSign expects to reduce the stock option expense it otherwise would have been required to record by approximately $27.7 million in 2006. The
acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our expenses in 2005.

The fair value of stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan options was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, rights to purchase shares are only granted during the first and third quarter of each year. The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options
and Employee Stock Purchase Plan options for each period presented:

The weighted-average
fair value of stock options granted was $10.80, $10.80 and $9.00 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified
as available-for-sale. The following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2004 and 2005:

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject VeriSign to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. VeriSign maintains its cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities with high quality financial institutions and, as part of its cash management process,
performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. In addition, the portfolio of investments in marketable securities conforms to VeriSign’s policy regarding concentration of investments, maximum
maturity and quality of investment. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited by the diversity of the customer base and geographic dispersion. VeriSign also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally requires no collateral. VeriSign maintains an allowance for potential credit losses on its accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts:

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

,” which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of
such expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. VeriSign is required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of
2006 and will recognize stock-based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See “

Stock
Compensation Plans and Unearned Compensation

” above for further information regarding the pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share amounts, for 2003 through 2005, as if VeriSign had used a fair-value-based method similar
to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although the Company has not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro
forma disclosures under SFAS 123, VeriSign is evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expects the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on its consolidated statements of operations and net income per share.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-1 (“FSP
109-1”), “

Application of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

” The AJCA introduces a
special 9% tax deduction on qualified production activities. FSP 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with SFAS 109. Pursuant to the AJCA, VeriSign will not be able to claim this
tax benefit until the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-2 (“FSP
109-2”), “

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004.

”



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation
provision), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. The Company does not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 (“SFAS 154”), “

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

” which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 “

Accounting Changes

”
and SFAS No. 3, “

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements—An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28

”. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a
voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the
Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The impact that the adoption of SFAS 154 will have on VeriSign’s results of operations and financial position will depend on the nature of future accounting changes adopted by VeriSign and the nature
of transitional guidance provided in future accounting pronouncements.

acquisition of Retail Solutions International, Inc. (“RSI”), a Lincoln, Rhode Island-based privately-held provider of operational point-of-sale data to the retail industry. VeriSign’s purchase price of $25.2 million for all of the
outstanding capital stock and vested options of RSI consisted of approximately $23.2 million in cash consideration and $0.4 million in direct transaction costs. VeriSign also assumed unvested stock options of RSI with a fair value of $1.6 million.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase of a business and, accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the
acquisition date. RSI’s results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. RSI’s results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not material when
compared with VeriSign’s consolidated results. As a result of the acquisition of RSI, VeriSign recorded goodwill of $17.1 million and intangible assets of $6.4 million, which have been assigned to the Internet Services Group segment. The
goodwill represents the excess value over both tangible and intangible assets acquired. The goodwill in this transaction is attributable to the anticipated ability to increase the scope of services VeriSign offers to retail supply chain participants
and enhances the infrastructure VeriSign has been developing in the RFID/EPC and pharmaceutical supply chain markets to deliver real time, relevant data for decision making. None of the goodwill for RSI is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable assets acquired in the purchase of RSI is 5.3 years. These identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

consisted primarily of research and development efforts required for the completion of all planning, design, development, and test activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design
specifications including features, functions, and performance.

VeriSign determined the fair value of the acquired in-process research and development by estimating the projected cash flows related to the project or service and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the service. VeriSign
discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values. VeriSign based the net cash flows from such projects on its analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating

VeriSign received a payment from Network Solutions in the amount of $20.0 million, which included $14.0 million to reduce the principal balance of the note receivable, $3.8 million of interest income related to the note receivable and a dividend
payment of $2.2 million recorded in other income. The present value of the note at December 31, 2005 was approximately $26.4 million using a 10% market interest rate.

The Network Solutions business provides domain name registrations, and value added services such as business email,
websites, hosting and other web presence services. Approximately 580 former VeriSign employees became employed by the Network Solutions business as a result of the transaction. In connection with the sale, VeriSign assigned the lease for its
facility located in Drums, Pennsylvania to the purchaser and subleased certain facilities located in Herndon, Virginia to the purchaser.

The following table summarizes the proceeds received, the assets and liabilities divested and the gain recorded by VeriSign on the closing date of the

Note 5.    Restructuring and Other Charges

Below is a comparison of the restructuring and other charges for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003:

2003 Restructuring
Plan

In November 2003, VeriSign announced a restructuring
initiative related to the sale of its Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. The restructuring plan resulted in reductions in workforce, abandonment of excess facilities, disposals of property and equipment and other
charges. To date VeriSign has recorded $57.2 million in restructuring charges under its 2003 plan.

Net restructuring and other charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 relating to the 2003 restructuring plan are as follows:

Workforce
reduction.

VeriSign recorded restructuring charges related to workforce reduction in accordance with SFAS No. 112, “

Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5
and 43

” since benefits were provided pursuant to a formal severance plan which used a standard formula of paying benefits based upon tenure with the Company. The accounting for these restructuring charges has met the four requirements of
SFAS No. 112 which are: (i) the Company’s obligation relating to employees’ rights to receive compensation for future absences is attributable to employees’ services already rendered; (ii) the obligation relates to rights that
vest or accumulate; (iii) payment of the compensation is probable; and (iv) the amount can be reasonably estimated. VeriSign recorded workforce reduction charges of $1.1 million in connection with workforce reduction of approximately 35
employees during 2004. During 2005, VeriSign adjusted the workforce reduction charges relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits, resulting in net reversals of approximately $0.8 million.

Excess facilities.

Excess facilities
restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space, including the potential for sublease income. Estimating the amount of sublease income

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented, the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each
property. These estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located, such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates. Changing market conditions by
location and considerable work with third-party leasing companies require VeriSign to periodically review each lease and change its estimates on a prospective basis. During 2005, VeriSign recorded reversals to its excess facilities primarily in
connection with a decision to utilize and build a facility that VeriSign had treated as abandoned under its 2003 restructuring plan and for which it had previously recorded a restructuring charge.

Exit costs.

VeriSign recorded other exit costs
primarily relating to the realignment of its Communications Services Group segment.

Other charges.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, VeriSign recorded other charges under the 2003 restructuring plan related to obsolete telecommunications computer software and other equipment
that was written off.

As of December 31, 2005, the
accrued liability associated with the 2003 restructuring plan was $12.2 million and consisted of the following:

2002 Restructuring
Plan

In April 2002, VeriSign announced plans to
restructure its operations to rationalize, integrate and align resources. This restructuring plan included workforce reductions, abandonment of excess facilities, write-off of abandoned property and equipment and other charges. To date, VeriSign has
recorded $110.2 million in restructuring charges under its 2002 restructuring plan.



VERISIGN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

Net restructuring and other charges, net of adjustments, recorded during the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 associated with the 2002 restructuring plan are as follows:

Workforce
reduction.

VeriSign’s 2002 restructuring plan resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees across certain business functions, operating units, and geographic regions.

Excess facilities.

Excess facilities
restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space, including the potential for sublease income. Estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will
be rented, the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property. These estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located, such as
the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates. Changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third-party leasing companies require VeriSign to periodically review each lease and change its estimates on a prospective
basis. VeriSign recorded charges relating to excess facilities that were either abandoned or downsized due to lease terminations and non-cancelable lease costs.

Exit costs.

VeriSign recorded other exit costs consisting of the write-off of prepaid license fees associated with
products that were originally intended to be incorporated into VeriSign’s product offerings but were subsequently abandoned as a result of the decision to restructure.

Other charges.

Property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned resulted in a net
charge during 2003 and consisted primarily of computer software, leasehold improvements, and computer equipment.

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

As of December 31, 2005, the accrued liability associated with the 2002 restructuring plans was
$6.1 million and consisted of the following:

Cash payments totaling
approximately $39.6 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities under both restructuring plans will be paid over the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through June 2014. The present value of future cash payments
related to lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities is expected to be as follows:

Other charges

During 2005, VeriSign recorded other charges of
approximately $21.6 million, relating to the abandonment of the development efforts related to an internally developed software project. During 2004, VeriSign recorded other charges of approximately $20.1 million relating to certain asset
write-offs.

Gross realized losses
on investments totaled $0.8 million in 2005 consisting of the impairment and sale of certain public and non-public equity investments. Gross realized gains on investments were $12.1 million in 2005.

Gross realized losses on investments totaled $12.6 million in 2004 consisting
of the impairment and sale of certain public and non-public equity investments. Gross realized gains on investments were $4.4 million in 2004.

Gross realized losses on investments totaled $17.0 million in 2003 consisting of the impairment and sale of certain public and non-public equity
investments. Gross realized gains on investments were $0.5 million in 2003.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the balance sheets. The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments were caused primarily
by interest rate increases. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at
December 31, 2005. All investments with unrealized losses at December 31, 2004 have been in a loss position for less than 12 months. Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004
were as follows:

pledged approximately $6.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively, as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of its contractual obligations, primarily relating to its real estate lease agreements, the longest of which is
expected to mature in 2014.

Note 7.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill as allocated to the Company’s operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004:

Purchased goodwill is
not amortized but is subject to testing for impairment on at least an annual basis.

A two-step evaluation to assess goodwill for impairment is required. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not
considered to be impaired and proceeding to the second step is not required. If the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill must be determined and compared to the
carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets (the second step). If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded.

VeriSign performed its annual impairment tests as of June 30, 2005, 2004
and 2003. The fair value of VeriSign’s reporting units is determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present
value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values
of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. In the application of the income and market valuation approaches, VeriSign is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables.
Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates.

There was no impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment tests conducted in June 2005 and 2004. The annual impairment test conducted in June 2003 resulted in an impairment
charge to goodwill and other intangible assets of $123.2 million during the second quarter of 2003. VeriSign recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of VeriSign entering into an
agreement to sell its Network Solutions business. The event triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to Network Solutions. After considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses
associated with the divestiture, VeriSign determined that the carrying value exceeded the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

implied fair value of Network Solutions’ goodwill. Total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as allocated to the Company’s operating
segments for the year ended December 31, 2003 are as follows:

The following tables
present details of VeriSign’s other intangible assets:

Fully amortized other
intangible assets are not included in the above tables. Amortization of other intangible assets was $101.6 million, $79.4 million, and $181.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

In November 1999, VeriSign entered into an
Agreement for the management and administration of the Tuvalu Internet top-level domain, “.tv,” with the Government of Tuvalu for payments of future royalties. Future royalty payment obligations will amount to $6.2 million. The current
portion of $2.2 million is due in 2006 and the long-term portion of $4.0 million matures as follows:

other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Note 9.    Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

VeriSign is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2005, no shares of preferred stock had been issued. In connection with its stockholder rights plan, VeriSign authorized 3 million shares
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. In the event of liquidation, each preferred share will be entitled to a $1.00 preference, and thereafter the holders of the preferred shares will be entitled to an
aggregate payment of 100 times the aggregate payment made per common share. Each preferred share will have 100 votes, voting together with the common shares. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which common
shares are exchanged, each preferred share will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per common share. These rights are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions.

Stock Repurchase Programs

To facilitate the stock repurchase program, designed to return value to the stockholders and minimize dilution from stock
issuances, VeriSign repurchases shares in the open market and from time to time enters into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties.

In 2001, the Board of Directors of VeriSign authorized the use of up to $350 million to repurchase shares of VeriSign’s common stock on the open
market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2005, VeriSign repurchased approximately 6.3 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $167.0 million. VeriSign completed its 2001 stock repurchase program during the third quarter of
2005. During 2004, VeriSign repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $113.3 million. During 2002 and 2003, no stock was repurchased. During 2001, VeriSign repurchased approximately 1.7 million
shares at a cost of approximately $69.5 million.

On
August 2, 2005, the Board of Directors of VeriSign authorized a $500 million stock repurchase program to purchase shares of VeriSign’s common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2005, VeriSign repurchased
approximately 16.5 million shares under this repurchase program at a cost of approximately $380.3 million. At December 31, 2005, approximately $119.7 million remained available for future repurchases under the 2005 stock repurchase
program.

On November 21, 2005, VeriSign executed an
accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large investment bank for the acquisition of 10.8 million shares for an initial purchase price of $23.14 per share. VeriSign acquired these shares as part of its $500 million stock
repurchase program authorized on August 2, 2005.

Under
the ASR agreement, the investment bank purchased an equivalent number of shares of common stock in the open market from time to time until it had acquired that number.

For further information, see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stockholder Rights Plan

On September 24, 2002, the Board of Directors of VeriSign, declared a
dividend of one stock purchase right (“Right”) for each outstanding share of VeriSign common stock. The dividend was paid to stockholders of record on October 4, 2002 (“Record Date”). In addition, one Right shall be issued
with each common share that becomes outstanding (i) between the Record Date and the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) or (ii) following
the Distribution Date and prior to the Redemption Date or Final Expiration Date, pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities of VeriSign, which
options or securities were outstanding prior to the Distribution Date. The Rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Rights Agreement (“Rights Agreement”), including the acquisition of 20%
of VeriSign’s outstanding common stock by a person or group. Each Right entitles the registered holder, other than an “acquiring person”, under specified circumstances, to purchase from VeriSign one one-hundredth of a share of
VeriSign Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Preferred Share”), at a price of $55.00 per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of
the Rights will not be redeemable. In addition, each Right entitles the registered holder, other than an “acquiring person”, under specified circumstances, to purchase from VeriSign that number of shares of VeriSign common stock having a
market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In February 2006, VeriSign’s Board of Directors reviewed the stockholder rights plan and determined that it continues to be in the best interest of VeriSign and its stockholders.

No cash dividends have been declared or paid on
VeriSign’s common stock since inception.

Note 10.     Calculation of Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to dilutive common equivalent shares, including unvested stock options, employee stock purchases, unvested
restricted stock and restricted stock units, and warrants using the treasury stock method.

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:

For 2005 and 2004,
VeriSign excluded 13,739,751 and 12,133,492 weighted-average stock options respectively, with an exercise price that exceeded the average fair market value of VeriSign’s common stock for the respective periods with weighted-average exercise
prices of $57.53 and $69.80. These options could be dilutive in the future if the average fair market value of VeriSign’s common stock increases and is equal to or greater than the exercise price of these options. For 2003, VeriSign excluded
2,717,195 weighted-average potential common shares, with a weighted-average exercise price of $8.33 for the period because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Note 11.     Stock Compensation Plans

Stock Option Plans

As of December 31, 2005, a total of 54,966,080 shares of common stock
were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and for the future grant of stock options or awards under VeriSign’s equity incentive plans.

The 1995 Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Stock Option Plan (“1995 and 1997 Plans”) were terminated concurrent with VeriSign’s initial
public offering in 1998. Options to purchase common stock granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans remain outstanding and subject to the vesting and exercise terms of the original grant. All shares that remained available for future issuance under the
1995 and 1997 Plans at the time of their termination were transferred to the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan. No further options can be granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans. Options granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans are subject to terms
substantially similar to those described below with respect to options granted under the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

The 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (“1998 Plan”) authorizes the award of options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock bonuses.
Options may be granted at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value of VeriSign’s common stock on the date of grant for incentive stock options and 85% of the fair market value for non-qualified stock options. All options
are granted at the discretion of the Board and have a term not greater than 7 years from the date of grant. Options issued generally vest 25% on the first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. Restricted stock awards and
restricted stock units entitle the recipient to receive, at VeriSign’s discretion, shares or cash upon vesting.

The following table summarizes information about restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity:

(1)

Upon vesting of the restricted stock units, the Company intends to settle the units in shares.

(2)

In August 2005, VeriSign issued 127,683 restricted stock units, net of forfeitures, to certain executive officers. These restricted stock units vest over a four-year period at the
rate of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% for each year. The aggregate market value of the restricted stock units as of the date of issuance was approximately $3.4 million and was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized ratably over the four
year vesting period.

(3)

In November 2005, VeriSign granted 86,000 restricted stock units to Stratton Sclavos, its Chief Executive Officer. These restricted stock units vest 25% on the first anniversary
date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. The aggregate market value of the restricted stock units granted to Mr. Sclavos in 2005 at the date of issuance was $2.0 million and was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized
ratably over the four year vesting period.

(4)

In December 2004, VeriSign granted 125,000 restricted stock units under its 1998 Equity Incentive Plan to Stratton Sclavos. 100,000 of the restricted stock units progressively vest
over a four-year period at the rate of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% for each year. The remaining 25,000 restricted stock units vest 25% on the first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. The aggregate market value of the
restricted stock units granted to Mr. Sclavos in 2004 at the date of issuance was $4.2 million and was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized ratably over the four year vesting period.

In August 2003, VeriSign granted 150,000 shares of restricted stock to certain executive officers. The shares vest over a two-year period, with 2/3 of the shares eligible to be sold
at the end of two years and the remaining 1/3 eligible at the end of the third year. The aggregate market value of the restricted stock at the date of issuance was $1.9 million and was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized ratably
over the two year vesting period.

At
December 31, 2005, 13,032,386 shares remain available for future awards under the 1998 Plan including shares transferred from the 1995 and 1997 plans that were terminated.

The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (“2001 Plan”) authorizes the award of non-qualified stock options and restricted
stock awards to eligible employees, officers who are not subject to Section 16 reporting requirements, contractors and consultants. As of December 31, 2005, no restricted stock awards have been made under the 2001 Plan. Options may be
granted at an exercise price not less than the par value of VeriSign’s common stock on the date of grant. All options are granted at the discretion of the Board and have a term not greater than 10 years from the date of grant. Options
issued generally vest 25% on the first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. At December 31, 2005, 5,816,445 shares remain available for future awards under the 2001 Plan. On January 1 of each year beginning in 2002,
the number of shares available for grant under the 2001 Plan will automatically be increased by an amount equal to 2% of the outstanding common shares on the immediately preceding December 31.

Members of the Board who are not employees of VeriSign, or of any parent,
subsidiary or affiliate of VeriSign, are eligible to participate in the 1998 Directors Plan (“Directors Plan”). The option grants under the Directors Plan are automatic and non-discretionary, and the exercise price of the options is 100%
of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Each eligible director is initially granted an option to purchase 25,000 shares on the date he or she first becomes a director (“Initial Grant”). On each anniversary of
a director’s Initial Grant or most recent grant if he or she was ineligible to receive an Initial Grant, each eligible director will automatically be granted an additional option to purchase 12,500 shares of common stock if the director has
served continuously as a director since the date of the Initial Grant or most recent grant. The term of the options under the Directors Plan is ten years and options vest as to 6.25% of the shares each quarter after the date of the grant, provided
the optionee remains a director of VeriSign. At December 31, 2005, 479,017 shares remain available for future grant under the Directors Plan.

In connection with its acquisitions in 2005, VeriSign assumed some of the acquired companies’ stock options. Options assumed generally have terms of
seven to ten years and generally vest over a four-year period.

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

The increase in current tax expense for foreign operations in 2005 as compared to 2004 was the result
of including the full year of operations of Jamba! GmbH. The increase between 2003 and 2004 to current tax expense for foreign operations was the result of including the operations of Jamba! which were acquired in 2004.

The difference between income tax expense and the amount resulting from
applying the federal statutory rate of 35% to net income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes is attributable to the following:

The tax effects of
temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of VeriSign’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The total valuation
allowance decreased $138.2 million in 2005, primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of the discontinued operations. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is based on
several factors, including the Company’s past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities. As of December 31, 2005, management does not believe it is more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets relating to U.S. federal and state operations are realizable. However, depending on VeriSign’s continued ability to achieve profitability, and on the potential impact of SFAS No. 123R (“SFAS 123R”),

“Share Based Payment”

, it may have sufficient evidence in 2006 to conclude that realization of additional deferred tax assets is more likely than not and thus realize a tax benefit in that period from a reduction of its deferred tax
asset valuation allowance.

If the valuation allowance relating
to deferred assets were released as of December 31, 2005, approximately $237.7 million would be credited to the statement of operations, and $101.2 million would be credited to additional paid-in capital. Management would continue to apply a
valuation allowance of $55.8 million to the deferred tax asset relating to the write-down of investments, due to the limited carryover life and character of such tax attributes. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that $8.3
million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable; therefore, a valuation allowance is applied to the deferred tax asset. On the remaining foreign operations, management believes it is more likely than not that
deferred tax assets will be realized; accordingly, a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets.

As of December 31, 2005, VeriSign had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $231.4 million, state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $242.5 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $31.1 million. If VeriSign is not able to use them, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2023 and the
state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2006 through 2023. Most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire, but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign
subsidiary. VeriSign had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately $7.0 million available for carryforward to future years, and for state income tax purposes of approximately $3.8 million available for
carryforward to future years. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2010 through 2025. State research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the
utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. VeriSign experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50 percent in 2003 and 2002.
These changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on VeriSign’s ability to utilize U.S. Federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards of $232.9 million and $116.5 million, respectively. Losses not
utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward, but are subject to the expiration dates described in the prior paragraph.

Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The amount of such earnings included in consolidated
retained earnings at December 31, 2005 was $98.1 million, principally from VeriSign Japan KK and Jamba! GmbH. These earnings have been permanently reinvested and VeriSign does not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment
of income taxes thereon. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings.

Legal Proceedings

that third-party. These indemnification obligations are generally subject to limits as specified in the agreement. It is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments VeriSign could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements. To date, VeriSign has not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to indemnification agreements. VeriSign has not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification agreements at
December 31, 2005 or 2004.

Note 14.    Segment Information

Description of Segments

During 2005 and 2004, VeriSign operated its business in two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. During 2003, VeriSign operated its business in three reportable segments: the Internet
Services Group, the Communications Services Group, and the Network Solutions business segment. The Network Solutions business provided domain name registration, and value added services such as business email, websites, hosting and other web
presence services. On November 25, 2003, VeriSign completed the sale of its Network Solutions business to Pivotal Private Equity.

The Internet Services Group consists of the Security Services business and Information Services business. The Security Services business provides products
and services to enterprises and organizations that want to establish and deliver secure Internet-based services for their customers and business partners, including the following types of services: enterprise security services, including
VeriSign’s managed security and authentication services, and e-commerce services, including Web trust services. The Information Services business provides registry services as the exclusive registry of domain names in the

gTLDs and certain ccTLDs, as well as providing certain value added services.

The Communications Services Group provides specialized managed communications services to wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers, cable companies and enterprise customers. VeriSign’s managed
communications service offerings include network services, intelligent database and directory services, application services, content services, and billing and payment services.

The segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) views and
evaluates VeriSign’s operations. VeriSign’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM as defined by SFAS No. 131, “

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.

” Other factors,
including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels, were also considered in determining the reportable segments. Additionally, the performance of the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group is
the measure used by the CODM for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources between the segments.

The accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are generally the same as those described in Note 1.
