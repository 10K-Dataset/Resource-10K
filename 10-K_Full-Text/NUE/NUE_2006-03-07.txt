Nucor Corporation


i


PART I

Item 1. Business

Nucor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1958. The business of Nucor
Corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and steel products, which accounted for all of the sales and the majority of the earnings in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The earnings in 2005 include other income of $9.2 million in
settlement of claims against third parties related to environmental matters. The earnings in 2004 and 2003 include other income of $1.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively, related to pre-tax gains on the sale of equipment. The earnings in 2003
include a pre-tax gain of $7.1 million related to graphite electrodes anti-trust settlements.

Nucor is the nation’s largest
recycler, using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products. In 2005, we recycled over 23 million tons of scrap steel.

Nucor reports its results in two segments: steel mills and steel products. Net sales to external customers, intercompany sales, depreciation expense, earnings (loss) before income taxes, assets and capital expenditures by segment for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, are set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2005 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference.

Principal products from the steel mills segment are hot-rolled steel (angles, rounds, flats, channels, sheet, wide-flange beams, pilings, billets,
blooms, beam blanks and plate) and cold-rolled steel. Principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems and light gauge steel framing.
Hot-rolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap, utilizing electric arc furnaces, continuous casting and automated rolling mills. Cold-rolled steel, cold finished steel, steel joists and joist girders, and steel fasteners are manufactured by
further processing of hot-rolled steel. Steel deck is manufactured from cold-rolled steel.

In the steel mills segment, hot-rolled
and cold-rolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders. In addition, other hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained. In 2005, approximately 92% of the steel mills segment production was
sold to non-affiliated customers; the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment. Hot-rolled steel and cold-rolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers, fabricators and manufacturers throughout the United States. In
2005, approximately 45% of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale. These contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing
raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months. In the steel mills segment, Nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately $2.87 billion and $1.63 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These
orders are normally filled within one year.

In the steel products segment, steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck are sold
to general contractors and fabricators throughout the United States. Substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained. All sales contracts are firm fixed-price contracts and are normally competitively
bid against other suppliers. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the
United States. Nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately $473.7 million and $408.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These orders are normally filled within one year.



The primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap, which is acquired from numerous
sources throughout the country. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 74% from $137 per ton in 2003 to $238 per ton in 2004 and increased an additional 3% to $244 per ton in 2005. In response to the escalating scrap
steel prices, Nucor successfully implemented a raw material sales price surcharge in 2004. This surcharge has helped offset the impact of significantly higher scrap prices and has ensured that we were able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our
customers’ orders. The primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel, which is almost entirely purchased from the steel mills segment.

The steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas. Nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used
during the manufacturing process. Historically, U.S.-based manufacturers have enjoyed competitive energy costs that have allowed competition on equal footing in what is becoming more and more a global market. In recent decades, our government has
allowed a growing over-reliance on natural gas for the generation of electricity, while at the same time preventing access to some of the most promising areas for natural gas exploration. As a result, natural gas prices have increased from less than
$2.00 per mmbtu in the 1990’s (NYMEX Henry-Hub pricing) to a peak of more than $15.00 per mmbtu in December 2005. Since an increasing share of electricity is now generated using natural gas, higher natural gas prices are also increasing costs
for consumers of electricity. Nucor actively supports several organizations that are promoting a more rational energy policy. We believe this is critical for not only our future business success, but also for the future of the U.S. economy. Supplies
of raw materials and energy have been, and are expected to be, adequate to operate our facilities.

Products from both segments are
marketed mainly through in-house sales forces. The principal competitive factors are price and service. The markets that Nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions. Considerable
competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports. Unfairly traded, illegally dumped steel imports have devastated the U.S. steel industry and its workers. In March 2002, the Bush Administration imposed a series of tariffs,
known as Section 201, to help the domestic steel industry recover from the illegal and predatory trading practices of foreign trading competitors. In December 2003, the Administration chose to end the temporary steel safeguard tariffs prior to
their scheduled expiration; however, we are optimistic about the Bush Administration’s commitment to strengthen and enforce existing U.S. trade laws and the President’s promise to work with Congress to achieve a long-term solution to
illegal dumping and other unfair trade practices that necessitated Section 201. There can be no assurance that such solutions will be achieved. Nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and that oppose
currency manipulation.

Nucor has historically focused on optimizing existing operations to ensure that they are among the most
productive and efficient facilities in the United States. In recent years, however, our focus has expanded to include growing profitably through acquisitions, particularly in the steel mills segment.

In July 2004, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Tuscaloosa, Inc., purchased substantially all of the steelmaking assets of Corus
Tuscaloosa for a price of approximately $89.4 million. The facility is a coiled plate mill that manufactures pressure vessel steel coil, discrete plate and cut-to-length plate products with an initial annual capacity of approximately 800,000 tons.
Our continued investments in this facility combined with the benefits of our incentive pay program have increased the capacity to 1,200,000 tons currently. This acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and made a significant operating
contribution in the second half of 2004 and in 2005.

In August 2004, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Decatur,
LLC, purchased certain assets of Worthington Industries, Inc.’s cold rolling mill located adjacent to our steel mill in Decatur, Alabama, for a cash purchase price of approximately $80.3 million. The assets purchased include all of the
buildings, the pickle line, four-stand tandem cold mill, temper mill and annealing furnaces. This 1,000,000-ton cold mill facility has 600,000 tons of annealing capacity and provides expanded value-added products to our customers in the Southeast.



In February 2005, Nucor purchased the assets of Fort Howard Steel, Inc.’s operations in Oak
Creek, Wisconsin, for a cash purchase price of approximately $44.1 million. This facility produces cold finished bar product and has approximately 140,000 tons of annual capacity.

In June 2005, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Marion, Inc., purchased substantially all of the assets of Marion Steel Company for a
cash purchase price of approximately $110.7 million. This facility produces angles, flats, rebar, rounds and signposts. This facility has already grown its capacity from 400,000 tons to 450,000 tons largely as a result of our incentive-based
compensation program.

Nucor is also growing through “greenfield” projects using new technologies and growing globally
through joint ventures.

Nucor began operations of its 100% owned Castrip

®

facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 2002. This facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting, to which Nucor holds
exclusive rights in the United States and Brazil. Strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling, allowing lower investment and operating costs, reduced energy consumption
and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology. This process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions, particularly NOx. The Castrip process
achieved commercial viability in 2004. We have selected Nucor-Yamato Steel in Blytheville, Arkansas as the location for our second Castrip production facility. We also plan to establish at least one joint venture with a partner overseas in 2006 to
utilize the Castrip technology.

Nucor established two rebar fabrication joint ventures in 2004 and 2005 with leaders in the
reinforcing steel construction markets. In 2004, Nucor purchased a one-half interest in Harris Steel, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Steel Group, Inc., to serve the western and northeastern U.S. rebar fabrication markets. This joint
venture continues to grow and to generate strong returns. In 2005, Nucor entered into an agreement with Ambassador Steel Corporation to form Nufab Rebar LLC. Nucor owns 49% of this rebar fabrication joint venture which should allow us to expand
Nucor’s rebar fabrication presence into the central and southern regions of the country. These investments in rebar fabrication complement our existing facilities by adding downstream integration from our bar mills into the value-added process.

Nucor’s raw materials strategy includes the goal of controlling between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 tons per year of our iron
units consumption. Three projects in particular represent Nucor’s initial steps towards achieving this goal: the HIsmelt

®

facility in Australia, the sustainable pig iron project in Brazil, and the direct reduced iron (“DRI”) plant in Trinidad.

In 2002, Nucor entered a joint venture with The Rio Tinto Group, Mitsubishi Corporation and Chinese steelmaker, Shougang Corporation, to construct a
commercial HIsmelt plant in Kwinana, Western Australia. The HIsmelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace, sinter/pellet plants and coke ovens. Additionally, the HIsmelt
technology offers an alternative supply of high-quality iron units as a scrap substitute. Nucor has a 25% interest in the joint venture that owns the HIsmelt commercial plant. Construction was completed and the start-up of operations began in 2005.
This plant has an initial annual capacity of 800,000 metric tons, which is expandable to over 1,500,000 tons.

In 2003, Nucor
entered a joint venture with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (“CVRD”) to construct and operate an environmentally responsible pig iron project in northern Brazil. The project, named Ferro Gusa Carajás S.A., will utilize two conventional
mini-blast furnaces to produce about 380,000 metric tons of pig iron per year in its initial phase, using iron ore from CVRD’s Carajás mine in northern Brazil. The charcoal source will be exclusively from eucalyptus trees grown in a
cultivated forest of 82,000 acres with the total forest encompassing approximately 200,000 acres in northern Brazil. The cultivated forest removes more carbon dioxide than the blast furnace process emits. Production of pig iron began in the fourth
quarter of 2005. It is anticipated that Nucor will purchase all of the production of the plant.



In September 2004, Nucor exercised its option to acquire the idled assets of American Iron
Reduction’s DRI plant located in Convent, Louisiana. These assets have been relocated to Trinidad and construction is well under way. We expect DRI production to begin in the fourth quarter of 2006 with an annual capacity of 1,800,000 metric
tons per year. The Trinidad site benefits from a low cost supply of natural gas under a long-term contract and from favorable logistics for receipt of Brazilian iron ore and shipment of DRI to the United States. This new entity is named Nu-Iron
Unlimted and has a capital budget of approximately $225.0 million.

Nucor is subject to environmental laws and regulations
established by federal, state and local authorities. In December 2000, Nucor entered into a consent decree with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain states in order to resolve alleged environmental violations. Under the
terms of this decree, Nucor is conducting tests at some of its facilities, performing corrective action where necessary, and piloting certain pollution control technologies.

Nucor has a simple, streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to be innovative. Our organization is
highly decentralized, with most day-to-day operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff. Only 66 employees are located in our executive offices. All of Nucor’s 11,300 employees are engaged in its steel mills and
steel products businesses. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and
uncertainty. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Our business supports cyclical industries such as the construction, energy, appliance and automotive industries.
As a result, downturns in the United States economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Because steel producers generally have high fixed costs, reduced volumes result in operating
inefficiencies. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2005, our net earnings have varied from a high of $1.31 billion in 2005 to a low of $62.8 million in 2003. Future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Overcapacity in the steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our
business, results of operations and cash flows.

Global steel-making capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. This
excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel at prices below their cost of production. These imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion
rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Overcapacity in China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel, has the potential to cause steel dumping in U.S. markets. A
significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could reduce demand for steel products in that country, resulting in China increasing steel exports.

The results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel.

We rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products. We acquire our
primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous sources throughout the country. Although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities, purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility. At any
given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us.

If our suppliers increase the price of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior
to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since
2004. If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product
introductions and suffer harm to our reputation.

Changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile
market conditions that could adversely affect our business.

Our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas.
We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These
market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. Increases in
our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We plan to continue
to implement acquisition strategies and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.

We plan to continue to seek
attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. Realization of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our
ability to integrate these transactions with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to
successfully integrate these businesses.

In addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the U.S.,
which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations, changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies.

Some of our competitors who have emerged from bankruptcy have lowered their operating costs, which could negatively impact our competitive position.

Over the past few years, many domestic steel companies have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and have continued to operate. Some have reduced prices to maintain
volumes and cash flows and obtained concessions from their labor unions and suppliers. In some cases, they have even expanded and modernized while in bankruptcy. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, these companies, or new entities that purchase their
facilities through the bankruptcy process, may be relieved of certain environmental, retiree and other obligations. Additionally, some of our competitors may grow by acquiring less expensive capacity out of bankruptcy. As a result, they may be able
to operate with lower costs, a primary competitive factor in the steel industry, which could negatively affect our competitive position.



Competition from other materials may materially adversely affect our business.

In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood. Increased use of these
materials in substitution for steel products could materially adversely affect prices and demand for our steel products.

Our operations are
subject to business interruptions and casualty losses.

The steel-making business is subject to numerous inherent risks,
particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. While our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and
cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance.

Our business requires substantial capital
investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements.

Our operations are capital intensive. For the five-year period ended December 31, 2005, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $1.34 billion. Our business also requires substantial
expenditures for routine maintenance. Although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from
borrowings under our $700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. Any future significant acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources.

Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment,
and we, accordingly, make provision for the estimated costs of compliance. These laws are evolving and becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates.

We have agreed to a comprehensive consent decree with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain states in order to resolve
alleged past environmental violations. Under the terms of the consent decree, we are conducting tests at some of our facilities, performing corrective action where necessary, and piloting certain pollution control technologies. The accrued
environmental costs include the expenses that we expect to incur as a result of the consent decree.

We believe our competitors are
subject to similar environmental laws and regulations. The specific impact on each competitor may vary, however, depending upon a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, production processes (such as a mini-mill
versus an integrated producer) and the specific products and services it provides. To the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our
competitive position could be materially adversely impacted.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.



Item 2. Properties

Our principal operating facilities by segment are as follows:

Our steel mills segment also includes a distribution center in Pompano Beach, Florida. In the
steel products segment, we have additional operating facilities in St. Joe and Waterloo, Indiana; Terrell and Denton, Texas; Swansea, South Carolina; Oak Creek, Wisconsin; and Dallas, Georgia. During 2005, the average utilization rates of all
operating facilities in the steel mills and steel products segments were approximately 82% and 78% of production capacity, respectively.

We lease our principal executive office in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Nucor is involved in various judicial and administrative proceedings as
both plaintiff and defendant, arising in the ordinary course of business. Nucor does not believe that any such proceedings (including matters relating to contracts, torts, taxes, warranties and insurance) will have a material adverse effect on its
business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

None during the quarter ended
December 31, 2005.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our share repurchase program activity for each of the three months and the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

(1)

Includes commissions of $0.02 per share.

(2)

On September 5, 2000, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 5,000,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock. On September 8, 2004, the Board of Directors resolved that the number of shares of common stock authorized for repurchase would increase 100% as a result of the 2-for-1 stock split on the record date of
October 15, 2004. At that time, the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase increased from 4,237,900 shares to 8,475,800 shares. On April 21, 2005, the Company publicly announced the reactivation of this stock repurchase
program. On December 6, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10,000,000 shares of its common stock, once the current repurchase authorization is completed. This repurchase authorization does not have a
scheduled expiration date.

Nucor has increased its cash dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1973.
In 2005, in addition to raising the base dividend, the board of directors implemented a supplemental dividend based on Nucor’s strong performance in 2004. Nucor paid dividends of $1.33 per share in 2005 compared with $0.44 per share in 2004. In
February 2006, the board of directors announced an increase in the base dividend to $0.20 per share and in the supplemental dividend to $0.50 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend of $2.80 per share. The payment of any future supplemental
dividends will depend upon many factors, including Nucor’s earnings, cash flows and financial position.

Additional information
regarding the market for Nucor’s common stock, quarterly market price ranges, the number of stockholders and dividend payments is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2005 Annual Report, pages 33 and 56.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

In the ordinary course of
business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them.

Interest Rate Risk

– Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2005, 43% of Nucor’s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds
that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. The remaining 57% of Nucor’s debt is at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. Nucor also makes use of interest
rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2005, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a
result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities.

Commodity Price Risk

– In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the
best prices for our raw materials and energy requirement and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In the first quarter of 2004, Nucor initiated a raw material surcharge designed
to pass through the historically high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials. Our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins.

Nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases
used in the production process when management believes it is prudent to do so. Gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into
cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2005, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes $55.8 million in unrealized net-of-tax gains for the fair value of these derivative
instruments. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10% and 25% in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by $20.1 million and $50.0
million, respectively. Any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Because these instruments are structured and used as hedges, these hypothetical losses would be offset by
the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle.
