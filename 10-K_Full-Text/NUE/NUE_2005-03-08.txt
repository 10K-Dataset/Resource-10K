PART I

Item 1.

Business

Nucor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1958. The business of Nucor Corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and
steel products, which accounted for all of the sales and the majority of the earnings in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The earnings in 2004 and 2003 include other income of $1.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively, related to pre-tax gains on the sale of
equipment. The earnings in 2003 and 2002 include a pre-tax gain of $7.1 million and $29.9 million, respectively, related to graphite electrodes anti-trust settlements.

Nucor is the nation’s largest recycler, using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products. In 2004,
we recycled over 17 million tons of scrap steel.

Nucor reports
its results in two segments, steel mills and steel products. Net sales to external customers, intercompany sales, depreciation expense, earnings (loss) before income taxes, assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, are set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2004 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference.

Principal products from the steel mills segment are hot-rolled steel (angles, rounds, flats, channels, sheet, wide-flange
beams, pilings, billets, blooms, beam blanks and plate) and cold-rolled steel. Principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems and light
gauge steel framing. Hot-rolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap, utilizing electric arc furnaces, continuous casting and automated rolling mills. Cold-rolled steel, cold finished steel, steel joists and joist girders, and steel
fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hot-rolled steel. Steel deck is manufactured from cold-rolled steel.

In the steel mills segment, hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders. In addition, other hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel
are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained. In 2004, approximately 90% of the steel mills segment production was sold to non-affiliated customers; the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment. Hot-rolled
steel and cold-rolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers, fabricators and manufacturers throughout the United States. In 2004, approximately 50% of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made
in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale. These contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months. In the steel mills segment,
Nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately $1.63 billion and $1.24 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These orders are normally filled within one year.

In the steel products segment, steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck are sold to general contractors and
fabricators throughout the United States. Substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained. All sales contracts are firm fixed-price contracts and are normally competitively bid against other
suppliers. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the United States.
Nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately $408.4 million and $234.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These orders are normally filled within one year.

The primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap, which
is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country. The average scrap cost per ton purchased increased $99 (55%) from December 2003 to December 2004. In response to escalating scrap steel prices, Nucor successfully implemented a raw material
sales price surcharge in 2004. This surcharge has helped offset the impact of significantly higher scrap prices and has ensured that we were able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ orders. The steel mills are also large
consumers of electricity and natural gas. Nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas



purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process. The primary raw material for
the steel products segment is steel, which is primarily purchased from the steel mills segment. Supplies of raw materials and energy have been, and are expected to be, adequate to operate the facilities.

Products from both segments are marketed mainly through in-house sales
forces. The principal competitive factors are price and service. The markets that Nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions. Considerable competition exists from numerous domestic
manufacturers and foreign imports. Unfairly traded, illegally dumped steel imports have devastated the U.S. steel industry and its workers. In March 2002, the Bush Administration imposed a series of tariffs, known as Section 201, to help the
domestic steel industry recover from the illegal and predatory trading practices of foreign trading competitors. In December 2003, the Administration chose to end the temporary steel safeguard tariffs prior to their scheduled expiration; however, we
are optimistic about the Bush Administration’s commitment to strengthen and enforce existing U.S. trade laws and the President’s promise to work with Congress to achieve a long-term solution to illegal dumping and other unfair trade
practices that necessitated Section 201. There can be no assurance that such solutions will be achieved. Nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and that oppose currency manipulation.

Nucor has historically focused on optimizing existing operations to ensure
that they are among the most productive and efficient facilities in the United States. In recent years, however, our focus has expanded to include growing profitably through acquisitions, particularly in the steel mills segment.

In July 2002, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Decatur, LLC,
purchased substantially all of the assets of Trico Steel Company, LLC for a purchase price of $117.7 million. Located in Decatur, Alabama, the sheet steel facility originally began operations in 1997 and has an annual capacity of approximately
1,900,000 tons. The purchase strategy called for a major renovation of the facility. Capital expenditures for this facility have exceeded $100.0 million from acquisition through 2004. Although we experienced equipment problems early in 2003, we
overcame these issues and generated an operating profit at this sheet mill in 2004. In August 2004, Nucor Steel Decatur, LLC purchased certain assets of Worthington Industries, Inc.’s cold rolling mill located adjacent to our steel mill for a
cash purchase price of approximately $80.3 million. The assets purchased include all of the buildings, the pickle line, four-stand tandem cold mill, temper mill and annealing furnaces adjacent to the current Nucor Steel Decatur, LLC steel plant.
This 1,000,000-ton cold mill facility has 600,000 tons of annealing capacity and provides expanded value-added products to our customers in the Southeast.

In December 2002, Nucor and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries purchased substantially all of the assets of Birmingham Steel Corporation
(“Birmingham Steel”) for a cash purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of approximately $615.0 million, including $116.9 million in inventory and receivables. Primary assets purchased were Birmingham Steel’s four operating mills
in Birmingham, Alabama; Kankakee, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; and Jackson, Mississippi, with a combined annual capacity of approximately 2,200,000 tons. These mills made significant contributions to Nucor’s sales and earnings in 2003 and
2004.

In July 2004, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary,
Nucor Steel Tuscaloosa, Inc., purchased substantially all of the steelmaking assets of Corus Tuscaloosa for a price of approximately $89.4 million. The facility is a coiled plate mill that manufactures pressure vessel steel coil, discrete plate and
cut-to-length plate products with an annual capacity of approximately 800,000 tons. This acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and made a significant operating contribution in the second half of 2004.

In February 2005, Nucor purchased the assets of Fort Howard Steel,
Inc.’s operations in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, for a cash purchase price of approximately $44.2 million. This facility produces cold finished bar product and has approximately 140,000 tons of annual capacity.

Also in February 2005, Nucor announced plans for the addition of vacuum
degassers at the sheet mills in Hickman, Arkansas, and Decatur, Alabama. The investment in these vacuum degassers will enable Nucor to



produce higher grades of sheet steel for automotive and appliance customers in the southern United States and Mexico. The capital cost to install each of the
degassers is estimated to be less than $20.0 million. The new vacuum degassers should be operational by the first half of 2006 and will increase total high quality, value-added annual capacity at the mills by an estimated 1,000,000 tons.

Nucor is also growing through “greenfield” projects using new
technologies and growing globally through joint ventures.

Nucor began operations of its 100% owned Castrip

®

facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 2002. This facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting, to which Nucor holds exclusive rights in the United States and Brazil. Strip casting involves the direct
casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling, allowing lower investment and operating costs, reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology.
This process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions, particularly NOx. The Castrip process has achieved commercial viability and we are in the process of selecting a site for our
second Castrip operation in the United States. We also plan to establish at least one joint venture with a partner overseas in 2005 to utilize the Castrip technology.

In 2004, Nucor purchased a one-half interest in Harris Steel, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Steel Group, Inc.,
for a cash purchase price of approximately $21.0 million. In addition, Harris Steel Group may receive up to an additional $6.0 million upon the achievement of certain operating results of the venture through 2008. The investment in this rebar
fabricator complements our existing facilities by adding downstream integration from our bar mills into the value-added process.

Nucor’s raw materials strategy includes the goal of controlling approximately one-third of our iron units consumption, which currently equates to
between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 tons per year of high quality scrap substitutes. Three projects in particular represent Nucor’s initial steps towards achieving this goal: the HIsmelt

®

facility in Australia, the sustainable pig iron project in Brazil, and the direct
reduced iron plant in Trinidad.

In 2002, Nucor entered a joint
venture with The Rio Tinto Group, Mitsubishi Corporation and Chinese steelmaker, Shougang Corporation, to construct a commercial HIsmelt plant in Kwinana, Western Australia. The HIsmelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to
liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace, sinter/pellet plants and coke ovens. The HIsmelt technology would offer an alternative supply of high-quality iron units as a scrap substitute. Nucor has a 25% interest in the joint venture that
owns the HIsmelt commercial plant. Construction is substantially completed and production is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2005. This plant will have an initial annual capacity of 800,000 metric tons.

In 2003, Nucor entered a joint venture with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce
(“CVRD”) to construct and operate an environmentally responsible pig iron project in northern Brazil. The project, named Ferro Gusa Carajás S.A., will utilize two conventional mini-blast furnaces to produce about 380,000 metric tons
of pig iron per year in its initial phase, using iron ore from CVRD’s Carajas mine in northern Brazil. The charcoal source will be exclusively from eucalyptus trees grown in a cultivated forest of 82,000 acres with the total forest encompassing
approximately 200,000 acres in northern Brazil. The cultivated forest removes more carbon dioxide than the blast furnace process emits. It is anticipated that Nucor will purchase all of the production of the plant. Production is scheduled to begin
in the third quarter of 2005.

In September 2004, Nucor
exercised its option to acquire the idled assets of American Iron Reduction’s direct reduced iron (“DRI”) plant located in Convent, Louisiana. Nucor began dismantling and refurbishing the plant for relocation to Trinidad and to expand
annual capacity to 1,800,000 metric tons per year. The Trinidad site will benefit from a low cost supply of natural gas and favorable logistics for receipt of Brazilian iron ore and shipment of DRI to the United States. Capital expenditures for this
facility are expected to be approximately $225.0 million, and operations are expected to begin in early 2006.



Nucor is subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal, state and local
authorities. In December 2000, Nucor entered into a consent decree with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain states in order to resolve alleged environmental violations. Under the terms of this decree, Nucor is conducting
tests at some of its facilities, performing corrective action where necessary, and piloting certain pollution control technologies.

Nucor has a simple, streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to be innovative. Our organization is highly
decentralized, with most day-to-day operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff. Only 59 employees are located in our executive offices. All of Nucor’s 10,600 employees are engaged in its steel mills and steel
products businesses. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.

Additional information on Nucor’s business is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2004 Annual Report, pages 7 through 15.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters

Nucor’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NUE. In September 2004,
Nucor’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of common stock in the form of a stock dividend. As a result, on October 15, 2004, stockholders of record received one additional share for each share held as of the record date of
September 30, 2004. The par value of Nucor’s common stock remains $0.40 per share. All share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

Nucor has increased its cash dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1973. We increased dividends twice in
2004, paying at the rate of $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.105 per share in the second and third quarters and $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter. On February 24, 2005, Nucor’s board of directors announced an increase in the base
dividend to $0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of $0.25 per share payable on May 11, 2005 to stockholders of record on March 31, 2005 for a total dividend of $0.40 per share. This additional dividend is the first installment of a total
estimated supplemental dividend of $1.00 per share to be paid over four consecutive quarters. Nucor’s board of directors stated that it intends to increase the base cash dividend amount in the future as financial conditions and earnings permit.
The payment of any future supplemental dividends will depend upon many factors, including Nucor’s earnings, cash flows and financial position.

Additional information regarding the market for Nucor’s common stock, quarterly market price ranges, the number of stockholders and dividend payments
is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2004 Annual Report, pages 28 and 46.

Information required by this item is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2004 Annual Report, page 2 (Forward-looking
Statements) and pages 16 through 24.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies
to manage them.

Interest Rate Risk

– Nucor
manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2004, 43% of Nucor’s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually.
The remaining 57% of Nucor’s debt is at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. From time to time, Nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes.
As of December 31, 2004, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a
significant impact on the value of our investment securities.

Commodity Price Risk

– In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, electricity and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the
best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In the first quarter of 2004, Nucor initiated a raw material surcharge designed
to pass through the historically high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials. Our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins.



Nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related
to natural gas purchases used in the production process when it is deemed prudent to do so by management. Gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets and
recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2004, accumulated other comprehensive loss includes $1.2 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative
instruments. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10% and 25% in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by $11.7 million and $29.1
million, respectively. Any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Because these instruments are structured and used as hedges, these hypothetical losses would be offset by the
benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle.
