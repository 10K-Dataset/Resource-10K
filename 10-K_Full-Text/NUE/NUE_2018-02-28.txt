Business

Overview

Nucor Corporation and its affiliates (“Nucor,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”)
manufacture steel and steel products. The Company also produces direct reduced iron (“DRI”) for use in its steel mills. Through The David J. Joseph Company and its affiliates (“DJJ”), the Company also processes ferrous and
nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, hot briquetted iron (“HBI”) and DRI. Most of the Company’s operating facilities and customers are located in North America. The Company’s operations include
international trading and sales companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the Company and others.

Nucor is North America’s largest recycler, using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products. In
2017, we recycled approximately 18.8 million tons of scrap steel.

General Development of our Business in Recent Years

The significant developments in Nucor’s business in recent years have aligned with our capital allocation strategy. Our highest
capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable long-term growth through our multi-pronged strategy of optimizing existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. Our second priority is to provide our stockholders
with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in delivering long-term earnings growth. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when our cash position is strong and attractively priced growth
opportunities are limited.

Nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include
more value-added steel mill products, improve our cost structure, enhance our operational flexibility and provide additional channels to market for our products. These investments total $2.53 billion over the last three years, with
approximately

two-thirds

going to capital expenditures and approximately

one-third

going to acquisitions. We believe that our focus on lowering cost will enable us to
execute on our strategy of delivering profitable long-term growth. Shifting our product mix to a greater portion of value-added products and increasing

end-user

market diversity will make us less susceptible
to imports.

The following recently completed projects to optimize operations at existing facilities within our steel mills
segment illustrate Nucor’s execution on the value-added product expansion and cost improvement aspects of our strategy. The final components of Nucor’s $290 million project at our South Carolina, Nebraska and Tennessee bar mills were
completed in 2015 to expand our special bar quality (“SBQ”) and wire rod production capabilities by approximately 1,000,000 tons. These SBQ projects allow us to produce engineered bar for more demanding applications that are less exposed
to imports while maintaining our position as a

low-cost

commodity bar producer by shifting production of rebar to our other bar mills. Additionally, our Nucor-Yamato Steel Company (“Nucor-Yamato”)
joint venture recently completed two major capital projects to broaden its product offerings. Nucor-Yamato completed a $115 million project in late 2014 to add several additional sheet piling sections which are wider, lighter and stronger,
covering more area at a lower installed cost. The joint venture also began shipping structural steel from its $75 million quench and self-tempering line in late 2016, which makes that mill the sole North American producer of certain
high-strength,

low-alloy

structural sections.

Nucor also recently announced several
new capital projects with 2019 targeted completion dates which align with our expansion of value-added product offerings and cost-reduction strategies. Our Nucor Steel Arkansas facility is building an additional cold mill at an estimated cost of
$230 million. That cold mill facility will expand our ability to produce advanced, high-strength

low-alloy

and motor lamination steel products. At our sheet mill located in Ghent, Kentucky, which we
acquired in 2014, Nucor recently announced plans to expand the 1,600,000

tons-per-year

mill by building a hot band galvanizing line for approximately $176 million.
We believe



the new galvanizing line will be the widest

hot-rolled

galvanizing line in North America with its

72-inch

product,
allowing us to enter new automotive market segments. Nucor has also recently announced several major investments within our bar mill group which will capitalize on our position as a

low-cost

producer of bar.
Nucor will build a 350,000

tons-per-year

rebar micro mill near Kansas City in Sedalia, Missouri at an estimated cost of $250 million. We believe that positioning
the micro mill near the Kansas City market will provide us with a freight cost advantage relative to more distant suppliers, and we will also benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing DJJ operations. The second bar
mill growth initiative is Nucor Steel Kankakee, Inc.’s plan to build a $180 million full range merchant bar mill with 500,000 tons of annual capacity at our existing mill in Bourbonnais, Illinois. Like the new micro mill, we believe that
the Kankakee mill will also benefit from logistical advantages and

low-cost

scrap supply. Finally, Nucor has begun construction on an $85 million modernization project at our Marion, Ohio bar mill which
will allow us to reduce our operating costs.

Nucor’s steel mills segment has also grown significantly in recent years
through the acquisitions of a plate mill in Longview, Texas (“Longview”), Independence Tube Corporation (“Independence Tube”), Southland Tube, Inc. (“Southland”) and Republic Conduit (“Republic”). Acquired
during the third quarter of 2016 for approximately $29 million, Longview is able to produce approximately 125,000 tons annually of higher value-added carbon and alloy plate products that can range from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches
wide. We completed the acquisition of Independence Tube during the fourth quarter of 2016 for approximately $430 million, and we completed the acquisition of Southland in January 2017 for approximately $130 million. From their five
facilities in Alabama and Illinois, Independence Tube and Southland are able to produce over 800,000 tons annually of hollow structural section (“HSS”) steel tubing used primarily in nonresidential construction markets. In January 2017,
Nucor also completed the acquisition of Republic, a steel electrical conduit manufacturer with plants in Georgia and Kentucky, for approximately $332 million. These three pipe and tube businesses provide Nucor with a new line of value-added
products to offer our customers, and they provide a value-added channel to market as the businesses are consumers of Nucor’s

hot-rolled

sheet steel.

The steel products segment has experienced recent growth as well through the September 2017 acquisition of St. Louis Cold Drawn, Inc.
(“St. Louis”) for approximately $60 million. With a manufacturing location in St. Louis, Missouri and another location in Monterrey, Mexico, St. Louis is able to manufacture approximately 200,000 tons annually of cold drawn rounds,
hexagons, squares and special sections to serve the U.S. and Mexican automotive and industrial markets. The St. Louis acquisition also provides an additional channel to market for the SBQ products that we produce at some of our bar mills. Also
within our steel products segment, we have recently acquired the assets of several businesses that will expand our bar grating presence in the United States and provide us with joist and deck production capabilities in Eastern and Western Canada to
better serve our customers in Canadian markets.

In addition to growing through capital expansions at existing operations and
acquisitions, Nucor also uses joint ventures as a platform for growth. In 2016, we announced the formation of a joint venture with JFE Steel Corporation of Japan in which Nucor will have 50% ownership in a plant that is being built in central Mexico
to supply galvanized sheet steel to the growing Mexican automotive market. The plant, which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2019, will cost approximately $270 million and will have an annual capacity of approximately 400,000
tons. Nucor’s sheet mills are expected to provide approximately half of the

hot-rolled

steel substrate that will be consumed by the joint venture.

Nucor’s second capital allocation priority is to provide our stockholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success
in delivering long-term earnings growth. Nucor has paid $1.45 billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years. That dividend payout represents 29% of cash flows from operations during that three-year period.

Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock. In 2015, Nucor’s Board of Directors approved a
share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $900.0 million of shares of its common stock. The Company repurchased $90.3 million shares of its common



stock in 2017, $5.2 million in 2016 and $66.5 million in 2015. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $738.0 million remained available for repurchase under the program.

Segments

Nucor reports its results in three segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials. Net sales to external customers, intercompany
sales, depreciation expense, amortization expense, earnings (loss) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017
are set forth in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Nucor’s 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders, which is incorporated by reference. The steel mills segment is Nucor’s largest segment, representing
approximately 72% of the Company’s sales to external customers in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Principal Products Produced

In the steel mills segment, Nucor produces sheet steel

(hot-rolled,

cold-rolled
and galvanized), HSS steel tubing, electrical conduit, plate steel, structural steel (wide-flange beams, beam blanks,

H-piling

and sheet piling) and bar steel (blooms, billets, concrete reinforcing bar,
merchant bar and special bar quality). Nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces, continuous casting and automated rolling mills. The steel mills segment also includes Nucor’s
equity method investments in Duferdofin Nucor S.r.l. (“Duferdofin Nucor”) and NuMit LLC (“NuMit”), as well as Nucor’s steel trading businesses and rebar distribution businesses. In the steel products segment, Nucor produces
steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, steel grating and expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In the raw materials segment, Nucor produces
DRI; brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, HBI and DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal. The raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations.

Markets and Marketing

The steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers, fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the United
States, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere in the world. Nucor produces

hot-rolled,

cold-rolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated
orders. We estimate that approximately 65% of our sheet steel sales in 2017 were to contract customers. The balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale. The proportion of tons sold to
contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including our consideration of current and future market conditions, our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’
requirements while considering the expected profitability, our desire to sustain a diversified customer base, and our

end-use

customers’ perceptions about future market conditions. These sheet sales
contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in the current market-based indices and/or raw material costs near the time of shipment. These sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months. Steel contract sales
outside of our sheet operations are not significant.

Our tubular, plate, structural, reinforcing and merchant bar steel come
in standard sizes and grades, which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders. In addition, our bar mill group manufactures

hot-rolled

SBQ products to
exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive, energy, agricultural, heavy equipment and transportation sectors. Almost all of our tubular, plate, structural, rebar, merchant bar and SBQ steel sales occur in the spot market at
prevailing market prices.

In 2017, approximately 83% of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external
customers. The remaining 17% of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our tubular products mills, our piling distributor and our downstream joist, deck, rebar fabrication, fastener, metal buildings and cold finish operations.



One of Nucor’s strategies for growth is expanding the channels by which our steel mills’ products can reach

end-user

customers. The percentage of
shipments consumed internally has increased from 14% in 2016 due to some of the recent investments in our business, such as the tubular products plants and St. Louis that consume steel produced by our steel mills.

In the steel products segment, we sell steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located
throughout the United States and Canada. We make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products. The majority of these contracts are firm, fixed-price contracts that are in most
cases competitively bid against other suppliers. Longer-term supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs. We sell and install fabricated reinforcing products primarily on a
construction contract bid basis. These products are used by contractors in constructing highways, bridges, reservoirs, utilities, hospitals, schools, airports, stadiums and high-rise buildings. We manufacture cold finished steel, steel fasteners,
steel grating, wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders. We sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the United
States and Canada.

We market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through

in-house

sales forces. We also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad. The markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are
affected by changes in general economic conditions.

In the raw materials segment, we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap
metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers. We also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes, supply ferro-alloys and provide transportation, material handling and other
services to users of scrap metals. Our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process. External customers purchasing nonferrous
scrap metal include aluminum can producers, secondary aluminum smelters, steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals. We market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through

in-house

sales forces. In 2017, approximately 10% of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers. We consumed the balance in our steel mills.

Also within the raw materials segment are our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana that produce high quality iron inputs able to be used
in our steel mills’ melting process, as well as our natural gas production operations. All natural gas produced by the drilling operations is and will be sold to outside parties.

Competition

We compete in a variety of steel and metal markets, including
markets for finished steel products, unfinished steel products and raw materials. These markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating, and, as a result of this highly competitive environment, we find that we
primarily compete on price and service.

Our electric arc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition,
including integrated steel producers (who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel), other electric arc furnace steel mills, foreign imports and alternative materials. Large
domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs. Electric arc furnace steel mill producers such
as Nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with large integrated steel producers.

Excess global steelmaking capacity, particularly in

non-market

economies, continues to be a significant challenge for Nucor and the entire U.S. steel industry. With
the U.S. economy performing better than most other



economies around the world and a strong U.S. dollar, the U.S. steel market is the destination of choice for global steel producers. In 2017, total steel imports increased by more than 15%
compared to 2016. Finished imports last year captured an estimated 27% market share. As a result, the domestic steel industry has continued to aggressively pursue trade cases to curb unfairly traded imports.

Competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us. Imported steel and steel products often
benefit from government subsidies, either directly or indirectly through government-owned enterprises or government-owned or controlled financial institutions. China, which accounts for almost half of the steel produced annually in the world, is the
prime example of how some foreign governments impact the global steel market. Nucor believes that Chinese producers, many of which are government-owned in whole or in part, benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency
exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies, which allow them to sell their products below cost. Other foreign governments utilize similar tactics to artificially lower their steel production costs. These distorting trade practices
are widely recognized as being unfair and have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce made favorable rulings in trade cases involving steel plate, rebar and wire rod.

Efforts by foreign companies to evade duties by routing products through third-party countries is also a challenge. Artificially-priced
imports and duty evasion schemes make it very difficult for Nucor to maintain sales prices and profit levels. As a result, Nucor joined three other steelmakers in filing a petition alleging China is circumventing coated steel sheet duties by
shipping product through Vietnam. At the end of the year, U.S. steel producers also received a favorable ruling in this case when the U.S. Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that corrosion-resistant and cold-rolled steel from
Vietnam that originated in China evaded U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy orders. A final determination is expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2018.

The U.S. government continues to treat China as a

non-market

economy, despite China’s insistence that it should be recognized as a market economy under its
Protocol of Accession to the World Trade Organization (the “Protocol”). China was a

government-run,

non-market

economy in 2001 when it entered the Protocol,
and China remains a

government-run,

non-market

economy today. The main objective of the Protocol was to encourage, and in some cases to require, China to make
market-based economic reforms. However, over the past 16 years, China has failed to take the required steps to establish that it is a market economy under U.S. law. Therefore, the United States had no reason to change its treatment of China as a

non-market

economy when one of the relevant provisions of the Protocol expired in December 2016. By treating China as a

non-market

economy in antidumping cases, the U.S.
Department of Commerce can assume that Chinese prices and costs are distorted, and may use other methodologies to calculate antidumping duties. This often results in appropriately higher duties against Chinese products in order to offset its unfair
trade practices. China has filed a challenge to the U.S. decision with the World Trade Organization.

Aggressive trade
practices, left unchallenged, seriously undermine the ability of Nucor and other domestic producers to compete on price. Competition from countries with subsidized production costs has significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs
from the United States. When such an exodus occurs, the U.S. economy is weakened and Nucor’s customer base is diminished. Rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers
that engage in unlawful trade practices. Nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements.

We also experience competition from other materials. Depending on our customers’ end use of our products, there are sometimes other
materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood that compete with our steel products. When the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises, these alternatives become more attractive to our customers.

Competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous. The scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly
fragmented. Firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal.



Backlog

In the steel mills segment, Nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately $1.87 billion and $1.52 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Order backlog for the steel mills
segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other Nucor businesses. Nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately $1.58 billion and $1.40 billion at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively. The majority of these orders will be filled within one year. Order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

For the past decade, Nucor has focused on securing access to

low-cost

raw material inputs as they are the Company’s largest expense. Nucor’s broad,
balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations, create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs. Our investment in DRI production facilities and
scrap yards, as well as our access to international raw materials markets, provides Nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs. Additionally, having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control
minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials, particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil. Continued successful
implementation of our raw material strategy, including key investments in DRI production, coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at DJJ, give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus help us
mitigate the risk of significant price fluctuations in input costs.

The primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are
ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron, DRI and HBI. On average, it takes approximately 1.1 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel. DJJ operates six regional scrap companies within the United States that have a
combined annual scrap processing capability of approximately 5,000,000 tons. DJJ acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources, including manufacturers of products made from steel, industrial plants, scrap dealers, peddlers, auto wreckers and
demolition firms. We purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana with respective capacities of approximately 2,000,000 and 2,500,000 metric tons annually. The primary raw material for our
DRI facilities is iron ore, which we purchase from various international suppliers.

In October 2016, Nucor concluded several
transactions to improve its access to a long-term supply of natural gas. Nucor purchased 49% of Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc.’s (“Encana”) leasehold interest covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin.
Further, Nucor and Encana also terminated the two Carry and Earning (“C&E”) drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012, and Nucor sold its 50% equity interest in Hunter Ridge Energy Services LLC (“Hunter Ridge”) to
Encana. Hunter Ridge is a gas gathering and water service provider formed by Nucor and Encana in 2012 to support the joint well development in the North Piceance Basin.

In the new arrangement, the determination of whether or not to
participate and invest in all future drilling capital investment by one working interest owner is independent of the other working interest owners. As such, Nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments.
By canceling the C&E drilling agreements, Nucor has eliminated all future carry capital and all contingent liabilities associated with those contracts, which should result in lower unit cost for any future drilling. Nucor retains all existing
producing wells it currently owns. To support Nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on the approximately 54,000 acres, Nucor has entered into long-term agreements directly with existing third-party gathering and
processing service providers.

The primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by Nucor’s steel
mills.

DJJ generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources
it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in Nucor’s steel mills. DJJ does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources. The availability and price of ferrous scrap
and other metallic inputs such as iron ore are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products.



Energy Consumption and Costs

Our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana are also large consumers
of natural gas. Consequently, we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas, including cash flow hedges and our natural gas drilling operations.

Historically, manufacturers in the United States have benefited from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed
them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace. The availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today, however, by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, advances in drilling
technology and, increasingly, changes in public policy relating to energy production and use. Because energy is such a significant cost for Nucor, we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy
efficient. We also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption. When appropriate, we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of
steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

Our business operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment. The
principal federal environmental laws include the Clean Air Act that regulates air emissions; the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) that regulates water discharges and withdrawals; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”)
that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “CERCLA”) that governs releases of, and remediation of, sites contaminated by
hazardous substances. Our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws.

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations.

Nucor uses electric arc furnaces (“EAFs”) to recycle scrap metal and scrap substitutes into new steel products. These EAFs use
electricity as their primary source of energy. As the Trump administration revisits any number of recently implemented environmental regulations, such as greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations, air toxics rules and emissions standards imposed
on coal-fired electric utilities, it is reasonable to assume that any cost implications would be delayed until those reviews are complete.

The CWA regulates water discharges and withdrawals. Nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of
the CWA and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits. Nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available.

The RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. The RCRA also addresses the environmental impact of
contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes. While Nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations, past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a
contamination threat are periodically discovered. These activities and

off-site

properties that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has determined are contaminated, for which Nucor
may be potentially responsible at some level, are quickly evaluated and corrected. While Nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under the RCRA, these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or
have been fully resolved.

Because Nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible
disposal of waste materials, Nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under the CERCLA for which Nucor has been named a potentially responsible party. Nucor continually evaluates these



types of potential liabilities and, if appropriate, maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities. Under the RCRA, private citizens may also bring an action against the
operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs. Nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with
these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them.

The primary raw material of Nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal. The process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many
contaminants such as paint, zinc, chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment. This filtrant (EAF dust) is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the RCRA. Because these
contaminants contain valuable metals, this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals. Nucor sends all but a small fraction of the EAF dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc, lead, chrome and other valuable metals from this
dust. By recycling this material, Nucor is not only acting in a sustainable, responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the CERCLA and the RCRA.

Nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as
management responsibility for environmental performance. All of Nucor’s steelmaking operations are ISO 14001 certified. Achieving ISO 14001 certification means that each of Nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in
place with measurable targets and objectives, such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use, and has implemented site-wide recycling programs. Many of our facilities have incorporated energy efficiency targets to reduce
both cost and environmental impacts into their environmental management systems. These environmental management systems help facilitate compliance with our environmental commitment, which is every Nucor teammate’s responsibility. Nucor’s
environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training, commitment, outreach and visibility.

Capital expenditures
at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2018 and 2019 are estimated to be less than $100 million per year.

Employees

Nucor has a simple, streamlined organizational structure to
allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate. Our organization is highly decentralized, with most

day-to-day

operating decisions made by our division
general managers and their staff. We have slightly more than 100 employees in our principal executive offices. The vast majority of Nucor’s approximately 25,100 employees as of December 31, 2017 are not represented by labor unions.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Many of the
factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may
negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The current global steelmaking
capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel. During periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. This excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting
significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. In some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries
certain cost advantages. These imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil
and other countries.

The

G-20

Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, citing data from
the Organisation for Economic

Co-operation &

Development and the World Steel Association, reports that in 2016 global steel production overcapacity was estimated at approximately 812,000,000 tons per
year, with China being the largest contributor to overcapacity. Total steel imports into the United States increased more than 15% in 2017 compared to the prior year. Excess capacity results in steel and steel products, which would otherwise have
been consumed by the local steel customers, being displaced into global markets and thereby putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage.

The domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in Europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing
the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies. Furthermore, the addition of new capacity in the United States could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally.

Our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business.

Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Our business supports cyclical
industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. As a result, downturns in the U.S. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows. While the United States has recently experienced modest growth in the general economy and steel demand in this country is stronger than in many parts of the world, the global and domestic steel industries continue
to face significant challenges. These challenges are caused by global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world. These situations can contribute to weaker

end-markets

and depressed demand for domestically produced steel and steel products, potentially resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results.

The economic outlook for our industry remains uncertain both in the United States and globally. While we believe that the long-term
prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for domestically produced steel and steel products below the 2007

pre-recession

levels. Future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Competition from other steel producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business.

We face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. The steel markets
are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. Depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and



availability, energy, technology, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially
adversely affected by competitive forces.

In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete,
aluminum, plastics, composites and wood. Increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products.

Since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new Corporate Average Fuel Economy mileage requirements
for new cars and light trucks that they produce. As automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to
improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in North America. Certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015.

The results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel.

We rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials,
including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products. Although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana and also acquiring DJJ, we still must
purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the United States. Although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these
critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate
supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. The availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production,
accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. Many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of
some foreign competitors. This trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the U.S. market.

If our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted
customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. Also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely
deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation.

Changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our
business.

Our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. In addition, our DRI facilities are also
large consumers of natural gas. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions.
These market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. Disruptions in the supply of our energy resources
could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. Increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Our steelmaking processes, DRI processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers,
customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other GHGs. The regulation of these GHGs through new rulemaking or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

Carbon is an essential raw material in Nucor’s production processes. As a
carbon steel producer, Nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent GHG regulations are further implemented. Because our operations are subject to most of these new GHG regulations, we are already impacted
in the permit modification and reporting processes. Both GHG regulations and recently promulgated National Air Ambient Quality Standards, which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new
permits and to modify existing permits.

These same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products
as they have increased and continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. The discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. However, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations
are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. The EPA has recently announced that it will be replacing the previously promulgated
Clean Power Plan that was driving many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants. At this time there is a significant degree of uncertainty with respect to the results of this change in regulatory direction. To the extent that these regulations
cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy, they could have an impact on Nucor’s competitive position.

While the federal government appears to be moving to relax burdensome regulations, some states are moving to enact their own regulations of carbon and other GHG emissions. If such regulations are enacted
in states in which Nucor does business, it could negatively affect those operations. Because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be
at a further competitive disadvantage. In addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of
our operations on the environment.

Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially
adversely impact our competitive position.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent
uncertainties in these estimates. The EPA has recently revised the rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. The new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue
recycling materials. Increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the United States to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. To the extent that competitors,
particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. If one of our permits is
revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash
flows.

We acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire.

We plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that
strengthen Nucor. Realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions



will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. Our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses.

Our
operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses.

The steelmaking business is subject to numerous
inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, unplanned critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions.
While our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance.

We are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of
our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information. Despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated
cyber-attacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. These risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely
affect our ability to physically produce steel, resulting in lost revenues, as well as delays in reporting our financial results. We also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security
breach, including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.

Our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of
our cash requirements.

Our operations are capital intensive. For the

five-year

period ended December 31, 2017, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $3.3 billion. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. Although we expect requirements for our
business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we
cannot assure you that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources.

Risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

Certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the United States, in Europe, Mexico and in emerging
markets. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. These risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. These risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and
therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.

The accounting treatment of equity method
investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings.

We periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value
is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. The results of this testing



for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. If
we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a

non-cash

impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations.

Tax increases and
changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
significantly affected the way U.S.-based multinational companies are taxed. Nucor expects to benefit from the Act’s domestic corporate tax law changes which will decrease the Company’s effective tax rate and cash tax liabilities. The
international portions of the Act, which transition the U.S. tax regime from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and provide for U.S. tax on certain types of foreign income, may cause tax increases on the Company’s foreign
operations. It is unclear the extent to which U.S. states will change their rates and tax base in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but changes could adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.

We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of
legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise
in the course of our business and in our industry. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance
investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks
will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them.

Interest Rate Risk

– Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At
December 31, 2017, approximately 27% of Nucor’s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. The remaining 73% of Nucor’s long-term debt was at fixed rates. Future changes
in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. Nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no such contracts outstanding.
Nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as
short-term investments.

Commodity Price Risk

– In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market
risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices
for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw
material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. When demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. DRI is
particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production.



Natural gas produced by Nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties
to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our Louisiana DRI facility and our steel mills in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was
approximately 21% of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and DRI facilities.

Nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas
purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. Gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income
taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2017, accumulated other comprehensive loss included $2.8 million in unrealized

net-of-tax

losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each
period. The following table presents the negative effect on

pre-tax

earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2017, due to an assumed 10%
and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands):

Commodity Derivative

10% Change

25% Change

Natural gas

$

15,640

$

39,110

Aluminum

3,657

9,164

Copper

4,088

10,261

Any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive
loss, net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. These hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities.

Foreign Currency Risk

– Nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in Canada, Europe and
Mexico. We periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were insignificant.
