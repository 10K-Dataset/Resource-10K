PART I

Item 1. Business

Nucor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1958. The business of Nucor Corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and
steel products, which accounted for all of the sales and the majority of the earnings in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The earnings in 2003 include other income of $4,400,000 related to a pre-tax gain on sale of equipment. The earnings in 2003 and 2002
include a pre-tax gain of $7,100,000 and $29,900,000, respectively, related to graphite electrodes anti-trust settlements. The earnings of 2001 include a pre-tax gain of $20,200,000 from the sale of Nucor Iron Carbide, Inc. in Trinidad.

Nucor reports its results in two segments, steel mills and steel
products. Net sales to external customers, intercompany sales, depreciation expense, earnings (loss) before income taxes, assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, are set forth in
Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2003 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference.

Principal products from the steel mills segment are hot-rolled steel (angles, rounds, flats, channels, sheet, wide-flange beams, pilings, billets, blooms,
beam blanks and plate) and cold-rolled steel. Principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems and light gauge steel framing. Hot-rolled
steel is manufactured principally from scrap, utilizing electric arc furnaces, continuous casting and automated rolling mills. Cold-rolled steel, cold finished steel, steel joists and joist girders, and steel fasteners are manufactured by further
processing of hot-rolled steel. Steel deck is manufactured from cold-rolled steel.

In the steel mills segment, hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders. In addition, other hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are
maintained. In 2003, approximately 93% of the steel mills segment production was sold to non-affiliated customers; the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment. Hot-rolled steel and cold-rolled steel are sold primarily to steel
service centers, fabricators and manufacturers throughout the United States.

In the steel products segment, steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the United States. Substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories
of finished products are maintained. All sales contracts are firm fixed-price contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are
maintained. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the United States.

The primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap, which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country. Scrap prices
increased $65 (57%) per ton from December 2002 to December 2003. In response to this increase, Nucor implemented a raw material surcharge that was effective in January 2004. This surcharge will help provide increased margins for our products and
will help ensure that we will be able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ needs. The steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and gas. Nucor uses natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to
price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process. The primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel, which is primarily purchased from the steel mills segment. Supplies of raw materials and energy have been, and
are expected to be, adequate to operate the facilities.

Item 1. Business, continued

Products from both segments are marketed principally through in-house sales forces. The principal competitive factors are
price and service. Considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports. During 2000 and 2001, imports of steel increased significantly, much of it at illegally dumped prices. In March 2002, the Bush
Administration imposed a series of tariffs for many products over a three-year period that helped reduce the flood of imports. In December 2003, the Administration chose to end the temporary steel safeguard tariffs, known as Section 201, prior to
their scheduled expiration; however, we are encouraged by the Bush Administration’s commitment to strengthen existing U.S. trade laws by closing the loopholes that permit import surges, circumvention of existing laws and repetitive dumping.

Nucor believes that the most significant factors with respect
to its competitive position are the low cost and efficiency of its production processes. The markets that Nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions.

In March 2001, Nucor purchased substantially all of the assets of Auburn
Steel Company, Inc.’s steel bar facility in Auburn, New York for approximately $115,000,000. This facility has the capacity to produce up to 450,000 tons of merchant bar quality steel shapes, special bar quality steel shapes and rebar. In
November 2001, Nucor acquired ITEC Steel, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Steel Truss and Frame Corp., with facilities in Texas and Georgia, for approximately $11,000,000, including liabilities assumed. These facilities, now known as Nucon
Steel, produce light gauge steel framing. The acquisitions were not material to the consolidated financial statements and did not result in material goodwill or other intangible assets.

In April 2002, Nucor entered a joint venture with The Rio Tinto Group, Mitsubishi Corporation and Chinese steelmaker,
Shougang Corporation, to construct a commercial HIsmelt

™

plant in Kwinana, Western Australia. The HIsmelt process converts iron ore fines and
coal fines directly to liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace, sinter/pellet plants and coke ovens. The HIsmelt technology would offer an alternative supply of high-quality iron units as a scrap substitute. Nucor has a 25% interest in
the joint venture that owns the HIsmelt commercial plant. Construction is approximately 50% completed and production is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2004. This plant will have an annual capacity of 800,000 metric tons.

Nucor began operations of its 100% owned Castrip

®

facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in May 2002. This facility uses the
breakthrough technology of strip casting, to which Nucor holds exclusive rights in the United States and Brazil. Strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling, allowing
lower investment and operating costs, reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology. This process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel through significantly
lower emissions, particularly NOx. During the second half of 2003, process improvements were made that increased the output of the Castrip facility, improved product quality and improved the life of key consumables. Multi-ladle casting sequences are
now part of routine production. Increased production and improved product quality are expected to continue in 2004.

In July 2002, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Decatur, LLC, purchased substantially all of the assets of Trico Steel Company, LLC for a
purchase price of $117,700,000. Located in Decatur, Alabama, the sheet steel facility originally began operations in 1997 and has an annual capacity of approximately 1,900,000 tons. The purchase strategy called for a major renovation of the
facility. Capital expenditures for this facility were approximately $68,000,000 in 2002 and $17,000,000 in 2003. Nucor Steel Decatur experienced equipment problems during start-up in the second quarter of 2003; however, we have overcome these issues
to build volume rapidly and improve quality. This acquisition was not material to the consolidated financial statements and did not result in goodwill or other intangible assets.

Item 1. Business, continued

In December 2002, Nucor and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries purchased substantially all of the assets of Birmingham
Steel Corporation (“Birmingham Steel”) for a cash purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of approximately $615,000,000, including $116,900,000 in inventory and receivables. Primary assets purchased were Birmingham Steel’s four
operating mills in Birmingham, Alabama; Kankakee, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; and Jackson, Mississippi, with a combined annual capacity of approximately 2,200,000 tons. This acquisition did not result in goodwill or other intangible assets.

In March 2003, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor
Steel Kingman, LLC, purchased substantially all of the assets of the Kingman, Arizona steel facility of North Star Steel (“North Star”) for approximately $35,000,000. The purchase price did not include working capital and Nucor assumed no
material liabilities of the North Star operation. This acquisition was not material to the consolidated financial statements and did not result in goodwill or other intangible assets.

In April 2003, Nucor entered a joint venture with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (“CVRD”) to construct and operate an
environmentally friendly pig iron project in northern Brazil. The project will utilize two conventional mini-blast furnaces to produce about 380,000 metric tons of pig iron per year in its initial phase, using CVRD iron ore from its Carajas mine in
northern Brazil. The charcoal source will be exclusively from eucalyptus trees grown in a cultivated forest of 82,000 acres with the total forest encompassing approximately 200,000 acres in northern Brazil. The cultivated forest removes more carbon
dioxide than the blast furnace process emits. It is anticipated that Nucor will purchase all of the production of the plant. Production is scheduled to begin in late 2004.

In January 2004, Nucor entered into an agreement with Harris Steel Group, Inc., for the purchase of a one-half interest in
its wholly owned subsidiary, Harris Steel, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $21,000,000. In addition, Harris Steel Group may receive up to an additional $6,000,000 upon the achievement of certain operating results of the venture over
the next five years.

Nucor’s backlog of orders at
December 31, 2003 was about $1,431,000,000 ($1,197,000,000 in the steel mills segment and $234,000,000 in the steel products segment). Nucor’s backlog of orders at December 31, 2002 was about $816,000,000 ($628,000,000 in the steel mills
segment and $188,000,000 in the steel products segment). These backlogs are normally filled within one year.

Nucor is highly decentralized and has approximately 55 employees in its executive offices. All of Nucor’s 9,900 employees are engaged in its steel
mills and steel products businesses.

Additional information
on Nucor’s business is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2003 Annual Report, pages 9 through 17.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Nucor is involved in various judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant, arising in the ordinary course of business. Nucor
does not believe that any such proceedings (including matters relating to contracts, torts, taxes, warranties and insurance) will have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
