PART I

Item 1.

Business

Nucor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1958. The business of Nucor Corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and steel products, which accounted for all of the sales and the majority of the earnings in
2002 and 2001, and all of the sales and earnings in 2000. The earnings in 2002 include a pre-tax gain of $29,900,000 related to a graphite electrodes anti-trust settlement. The earnings of 2001 include a pre-tax gain of $20,200,000 from the sale of
Nucor Iron Carbide, Inc. in Trinidad.

Nucor reports its results in two segments, steel mills and steel products. Net sales to external customers,
intercompany sales, depreciation expense, earnings before income taxes, assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, are set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of the 2002 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference.

Principal products from the steel mills segment are hot-rolled steel
(angles, rounds, flats, channels, sheet, wide-flange beams, pilings, billets, blooms, beam blanks and plate) and cold-rolled steel. Principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, cold finished
steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems and light gauge steel framing. Hot-rolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap, utilizing electric arc furnaces, continuous casting and automated rolling mills. Cold-rolled steel, cold finished
steel, steel joists and joist girders, and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hot-rolled steel. Steel deck is manufactured from cold-rolled steel.

In the steel mills segment, hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders. In addition, other hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained.
In 2002, approximately 90% of the steel mills segment production was sold to non-affiliated customers; the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment. Hot-rolled steel and cold-rolled steel are sold primarily to steel service
centers, fabricators and manufacturers throughout the United States.

In the steel products segment, steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck are sold
to general contractors and fabricators throughout the United States. Substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained. All sales contracts are firm fixed-price contracts and are normally competitively
bid against other suppliers. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the
United States.

The primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap, which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country. The
steel mills are large consumers of electricity and gas. Nucor sometimes uses natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process. The primary raw material for the
steel products segment is steel, which is primarily purchased from the steel mills segment. Supplies of raw materials and energy have been, and are expected to be, adequate to operate the facilities.

Products from both segments are marketed principally through in-house sales forces. The principal competitive factors are price and service. Considerable competition exists from numerous domestic
manufacturers and foreign imports. During 2000 and 2001, imports of steel increased significantly, much of it at illegally dumped prices. In March 2002, President Bush imposed a series of tariffs for many products over a three-year period that
helped reduce the flood of imports. The tariffs range from 8% to 30% in the first year, then decline to 7% to 24% in the second year and 6% to 18% in the third year. The International Trade Commission (“ITC”) has scheduled a section 204
mid-term review of the tariffs to evaluate their effectiveness. The Bush administration will then make a final decision on whether to maintain the tariffs, reduce them more quickly or end the tariffs prior to their scheduled expiration. The steel
industry has advanced several additional trade actions against dumped imports; however, since the implementation of

Item 1.

Business, continued

the tariffs in March 2002, the ITC generally
has ruled against the U.S. steel industry regarding incremental duties and tariffs.

Nucor believes that the most significant factors with respect to its
competitive position are the low cost and efficiency of its production processes. The markets that Nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions.

On July 22, 2002, Nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Decatur, LLC, purchased substantially all of the assets of Trico Steel Company, LLC (“Trico”) for a
purchase price of $117,700,000. The purchase price included approximately $86,000,000 of Trico’s debt that was assumed by Nucor. Located in Decatur, Alabama, the sheet steel facility originally began operations in 1997 and has an annual
capacity of approximately 1,900,000 tons. This acquisition was not material to the consolidated financial statements and did not result in goodwill or other intangible assets.

On December 9, 2002, Nucor and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries purchased substantially all of the assets of Birmingham Steel Corporation (“Birmingham Steel”) for a cash purchase price, excluding
transaction costs, of approximately $615,000,000, including $116,900,000 in inventory and receivables. Primary assets purchased were Birmingham Steel’s four operating mills in Birmingham, Alabama; Kankakee, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; and
Jackson, Mississippi, with a combined annual capacity of approximately 2,000,000 tons. This acquisition did not result in goodwill or other intangible assets.

Nucor began operations of its 100% owned Castrip

®

facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in May 2002. This facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting, to which Nucor holds exclusive rights in the United States and
Brazil. Strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling, allowing lower investment and operating costs, reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be
economically built with current technology. This process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel through significantly lower emissions, particularly NOx. Our team in Crawfordsville has succeeded in producing prime, saleable
coils, and the plant is now staffed to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

In April 2002, Nucor entered a joint venture with The Rio Tinto Group,
Mitsubishi Corporation and Chinese steel maker, Shougang Corporation, to construct a commercial HIsmelt plant in Kwinana, Western Australia. Demolition of the pilot plant is completed and construction of the commercial facility has begun. The
HIsmelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace, sinter/pellet plants and coke ovens. The HIsmelt technology would offer an alternative supply of high-quality iron units as a
scrap substitute. Nucor has a 25% interest in the joint venture that owns the HIsmelt commercial plant.

Nucor’s backlog of orders at December 31, 2002
was about $816,000,000 ($628,000,000 in the steel mills segment and $188,000,000 in the steel products segment). Nucor’s backlog of orders at December 31, 2001 was about $794,000,000 ($632,000,000 in the steel mills segment and $162,000,000 in
the steel products segment). These backlogs are normally filled within one year.

Nucor is highly decentralized and has approximately 48 employees in its
executive offices. All of Nucor’s 9,800 employees are engaged in its steel mills and steel products businesses.

Additional information on Nucor’s
business is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2002 annual report, pages 9 through 17.

Legal
Proceedings

In December 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice announced an agreement with Nucor and
certain states that resolved alleged environmental violations. Under the terms of the agreement or Consent Decree, Nucor will pilot new air pollution control technology and will evaluate and improve, as appropriate, its water pollution control
systems. Nucor will also evaluate and remediate any contamination that may be present on its sites. In July 2001, Nucor paid a $9,000,000 penalty and has agreed to spend another $4,000,000 in Supplemental Environmental Projects under this Consent
Decree. As part of the Consent Decree, Nucor is implementing an Environmental Management System throughout its operations. The agreement is comprehensive and involves eight Nucor steel mills and six Vulcraft facilities throughout the nation. Nucor
is involved in various judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant, arising in the ordinary course of business. Nucor does not believe that any such proceedings (including matters relating to contracts, torts, taxes,
warranties and insurance) will have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
