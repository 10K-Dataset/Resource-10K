Business

Overview

Nucor
Corporation and its affiliates (“Nucor,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) manufacture steel and steel products. The Company also produces direct reduced iron (“DRI”) for use in its steel
mills. Through The David J. Joseph Company and its affiliates (“DJJ”), the Company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, hot briquetted iron (“HBI”) and DRI. Most of the
Company’s operating facilities and customers are located in North America. The Company’s operations include international trading and sales companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the Company and others.

Nucor is North America’s largest recycler, using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel
products. In 2018, we recycled approximately 19.9 million gross tons of scrap steel.

Capital Allocation Strategy

The significant developments in Nucor’s business in recent years have aligned with our capital allocation strategy. Our highest
capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable long-term growth through our multi-pronged strategy of optimizing existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions.

Our second priority is to provide our stockholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in delivering long-term
earnings growth. Nucor has paid $1.45 billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years. That dividend payout represents 28% of cash flows from operations during that three-year period.

Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when our cash position is strong compared to growth
investment opportunities. In September 2018, Nucor’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock. The Board of Directors also terminated
any previously authorized repurchase programs. The Company repurchased $854.0 million of its common stock in 2018 ($90.3 million in 2017 and $5.2 million in 2016). As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.5 billion remained
available for share repurchases under the program.

General Development of our Business in Recent Years

Nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more value-added steel mill products,
improve our cost structure, enhance our operational flexibility and provide additional channels to market for our products. These investments total approximately $3.17 billion over the last three years, with approximately

two-thirds

going to capital expenditures and approximately

one-third

going to acquisitions. We believe that our focus on lowering costs will enable us to execute on our
strategy of delivering profitable long-term growth. Further, we believe shifting our product mix to a greater portion of value-added products and increasing

end-user

market diversity will make us less
susceptible to imports.

Several new capital projects that align with our expansion of value-added product offerings and
cost-reduction strategies are expected to be completed in 2019. At our sheet mill located in Ghent, Kentucky, Nucor’s approximately $176 million investment in a new hot band galvanizing and pickling line is expected to be operational in
the first half of 2019. We believe the new galvanizing line will be the widest

hot-rolled

galvanizing line in North America with its

72-inch

product, creating synergies
with Nucor’s other sheet mills and allowing us to enter new automotive market segments. Our Nucor Steel Arkansas facility is building an additional specialty cold mill at an estimated cost of $230 million that is expected to be operational
in the first half of 2019. That cold mill facility will expand our ability to produce advanced, high-strength

low-alloy

and motor lamination steel products.



We have several growth initiatives underway in our bar mill group with expected
completion dates in 2019 that will capitalize on our position as a

low-cost

producer of bar. Nucor is building a rebar micro mill capable of producing approximately 350,000 tons annually near Kansas City in
Sedalia, Missouri at an estimated cost of $250 million. We believe that positioning the micro mill near the Kansas City market will provide us with a freight cost advantage relative to more distant suppliers, and we will also benefit from the
scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing DJJ operations. We expect startup of the new mill in late 2019. Nucor Steel Kankakee, Inc. is building a full-range merchant bar quality mill with approximately 500,000 tons of annual
capacity at our existing mill in Bourbonnais, Illinois at an estimated cost of $180 million. Like the new micro mill, we believe that the Kankakee mill will also benefit from logistical advantages and

low-cost

scrap supply. We expect this project to be completed in late 2019. Nucor is also updating the rolling mill at Nucor Steel Marion, Inc. The approximately $85 million modernization project is
expected to be completed in

mid-2019

and will allow us to reduce the mill’s operating costs and better serve customers in Ohio and the surrounding states.

Additionally, Nucor has recently announced several major investments that are also in the steel mills segment. In March 2018, Nucor
announced that it will build a second rebar micro mill capable of producing approximately 350,000 tons annually in Frostproof, Florida. Similar to the mill under construction in Sedalia, Missouri, we believe this new micro mill will benefit from the
scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing DJJ operations. This approximately $240 million investment is expected to be operational in the first half of 2020. In May 2018, Nucor announced an approximately $240 million
investment to construct a new galvanizing line with an annual capacity of approximately 500,000 tons at our Nucor Steel Arkansas facility. This project complements the previously mentioned specialty cold mill project currently underway at the
facility and we believe it will accelerate our goal of increasing our automotive market share. The new galvanizing line is expected to be operational in the first half of 2021. In September 2018, Nucor announced an approximately $650 million
investment to expand the production capability at its flat-rolled sheet mill located in Ghent, Kentucky. This investment will increase the production capability from approximately 1,600,000 tons to approximately 3,000,000 tons annually and will
increase the maximum coil width to approximately 73 inches. This expansion is expected to be completed in

mid-2021

and complements the previously mentioned hot band galvanizing and pickling line that is
currently under construction as part of our initiative to further grow our sheet business. Most recently, in January 2019, Nucor announced plans to build a

state-of-the-art

plate mill in the U.S. Midwest with an expected investment of $1.35 billion. We expect the mill to be completed in 2022 and to be capable of producing approximately 1,200,000 tons
per year of steel plate products.

Nucor’s steel products segment has also grown significantly in recent years through
the acquisitions of the companies that make up our Nucor Tubular Products group. Nucor Tubular Products consists of the Independence Tube Corporation (acquired in October 2016), Southland Tube, Inc. (acquired in January 2017), Republic Conduit
(acquired in January 2017), and the assets of Century Tube, LLC (acquired in December 2018). The combined purchase price of these acquisitions was approximately $898 million. Nucor Tubular Products is optimizing the teams and assets of the
eight strategically located facilities to create leadership positions in the following markets: hollow structural section (“HSS”) steel tubing, piling, sprinkler pipe, steel electrical conduit, and mechanical tube for the automotive
market. The group has been well received in all markets as demonstrated by growth in revenue and volume shipped. The Nucor Tubular Products group provides Nucor with a new line of value-added products to offer our customers and a value-added channel
to market as the businesses are consumers of Nucor’s

hot-rolled

and cold-rolled sheet steel.

The steel products segment has also experienced recent growth as well through the September 2017 acquisition of St. Louis Cold Drawn, Inc. (“St. Louis”) for approximately $60 million. With
a manufacturing location in St. Louis, Missouri and another location in Monterrey, Mexico, St. Louis is able to manufacture approximately 200,000 tons annually of cold drawn rounds, hexagons, squares and special sections to serve the U.S. and
Mexican automotive and industrial markets. The St. Louis acquisition also provides an additional channel to market for the special bar quality (“SBQ”) products that we produce at some of our bar mills. Also within our steel products
segment, we have recently acquired the assets of several businesses that will expand our



bar grating presence in the United States and provide us with joist and deck production capabilities in Eastern and Western Canada to better serve our customers in the Canadian markets.

In addition to growing through capital expansions at our existing operations and acquisitions, Nucor also uses joint ventures
as a platform for growth. In 2016, we announced the formation of a joint venture

(Nucor-JFE)

with JFE Steel Corporation of Japan in which Nucor will have 50% ownership in a plant that is being built in central
Mexico to supply galvanized sheet steel to the growing Mexican automotive market. The plant, which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2019, will have a total cost of approximately $300 million (50% of which provided by Nucor)
and will have an annual capacity of approximately 400,000 tons. Nucor’s sheet mills are expected to provide approximately half of the

hot-rolled

steel substrate that will be consumed by the joint venture.

Segments

Nucor reports its results in three segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials. The steel mills segment is Nucor’s
largest segment, representing approximately 65% of the Company’s sales to external customers in the year ended December 31, 2018.

Principal Products Produced

In the steel mills segment, Nucor produces sheet steel

(hot-rolled,

cold-rolled and galvanized), plate steel, structural steel (wide-flange beams, beam blanks,

H-piling

and sheet piling) and bar steel (blooms, billets, concrete reinforcing bar, merchant bar and SBQ). Nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc
furnaces (“EAFs”), continuous casting and automated rolling mills. The steel mills segment also includes Nucor’s equity method investments in Duferdofin Nucor S.r.l., NuMit LLC and

Nucor-JFE,

as
well as Nucor’s steel trading businesses and rebar distribution businesses. In the steel products segment, Nucor produces HSS steel tubing, electrical conduit, steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel,
cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, steel grating and expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. The steel products segment also includes our piling distributor. In the raw materials segment, Nucor produces DRI; brokers
ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, HBI and DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal. The raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations.

Markets and Marketing

The steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers, fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the United
States, Canada, Mexico. Nucor produces

hot-rolled,

cold-rolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders. We estimate that
approximately 75% of our sheet steel sales in 2018 were to contract customers. The balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale. The proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given
time depends on a variety of factors, including our consideration of current and future market conditions, our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’ requirements while considering the
expected profitability, our desire to sustain a diversified customer base, and our

end-use

customers’ perceptions about future market conditions. These sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to
reflect changes in the current market-based indices and/or raw material costs at or near the time of shipment. These sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months. Steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are
not significant.

Our plate, structural, reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades, which allows us
to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders. In addition, our bar mill group manufactures

hot-rolled

SBQ products to exacting specifications primarily servicing
the automotive, energy, agricultural, heavy equipment and transportation sectors. The significant majority of our plate, structural, rebar, merchant bar and SBQ steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices.



In 2018, approximately 80% of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to
external customers. The remaining 20% of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our tubular products, piling distributor, joist, deck, rebar fabrication, fastener, metal buildings and cold finish operations.

One of Nucor’s strategies for growth is expanding the channels by which our steel mills’ products can reach

end-use

customers. The percentage of shipments consumed internally increased from 16% in 2016 to 20% in 2018 due to some of the recent investments in our downstream business, such as the tubular products plants and
St. Louis that consume steel produced by our steel mills.

In the steel products segment, we sell steel joists and joist
girders, and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the United States and Canada. We make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products. The
majority of these contracts are firm, fixed-price contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers. Longer-term supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw material
costs. We sell and install fabricated reinforcing products primarily on a construction contract bid basis. These products are used by contractors in constructing highways, bridges, reservoirs, utilities, hospitals, schools, airports, stadiums and
high-rise buildings. We manufacture cold finished steel, steel fasteners, steel grating, wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders. We sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners
primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the United States and Canada.

We market products from the
steel mills and steel products segments mainly through

in-house

sales forces. We also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad. The markets for these products are
largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions.

In the raw
materials segment, we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers. We also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes, supply
ferro-alloys and provide transportation, material handling and other services to users of scrap metals. Our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are EAF steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their
manufacturing process. External customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers, secondary aluminum smelters, steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals. We market scrap metal products and
related services to our external customers through

in-house

sales forces. In 2018, approximately 10% of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external
customers. We consumed the balance in our steel mills.

Also within the raw materials segment are our DRI plants in Trinidad
and Louisiana that produce high quality iron inputs able to be used in our steel mills’ melting process and our natural gas production operations. All natural gas produced by the drilling operations is and will be sold to outside parties.

Competition

We compete in a variety of steel and metal markets, including markets for finished steel products, unfinished steel products and raw
materials. These markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating, and, as a result of this highly competitive environment, we find that we primarily compete on price and service.

Our EAF steel mills face many different forms of competition, including integrated steel producers (who use iron ore converted into
liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel), other EAF steel mills, foreign imports and alternative materials. Large domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but
face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs. EAF steel mill producers, such as Nucor, are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs
compared with large integrated steel producers.



Excess global steelmaking capacity, particularly in

non-market

economies, continues to be a significant challenge for Nucor and the entire U.S. steel industry. Steel production in China rose in 2018, going from approximately 960 million tons in 2017 to
approximately 1.02 billion tons in 2018 – an increase of 6.6%. China’s share of global crude steel production rose from 50.3% in 2017 to 51.3% in 2018. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that
global excess steel production capacity was approximately 600 million tons at the end of 2017, a drop from its peak levels in 2015 and 2016. Nearly half of that excess capacity is located in China, where the largest steel companies are
state-owned and receive significant financial support from the Chinese government.

The Section 232 steel tariffs are
having their intended impact by preventing the dumping of steel products in the U.S. market. For the full year 2018, steel imports were down more than 10% from the previous year and imports accounted for approximately 23% of U.S. market share. About
4.1 million fewer tons of imports entered the United States in 2018. Ninety percent of the decrease in imports took place after the tariffs were fully implemented on June 1, 2018. The strong economy and lower imports generated 5 to
6 million tons in increased production for the U.S. steel industry this year. The comprehensive nature of the Section 232 tariffs are also preventing the transshipment of artificially

low-cost

steel
through third party countries.

The U.S. government is negotiating with several other countries to change the terms of our
trading relationship with them. Agreements have been reached with Brazil, Argentina and South Korea which exempted these countries from the steel tariffs in exchange for quotas limiting their exports of steel to the United States. The United States
also reached a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico – the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – though the steel tariffs still apply to those two countries. Trade negotiations are ongoing with China, the E.U. and Japan. These
negotiations, particularly with China, provide an opportunity to address the structural issues that encourage excess steel capacity, which we believe would create a sustainable level playing field. International efforts to address overcapacity,
namely the

G-20

Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, also continue. Failure to curb production overcapacity, particularly if the Section 232 tariffs are lifted in the future, would risk the resumption
of steel dumping in the U.S. market by foreign competitors.

We also experience competition from other materials. Depending on
our customers’ end use of our products, there are sometimes other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood that compete with our steel products. When the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises, these
alternatives become more attractive to our customers.

Competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous.
The scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented. Firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal.

Backlog

In the steel mills segment, Nucor’s backlog of orders was
approximately $2.08 billion and $1.62 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other Nucor businesses.
Nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately $2.26 billion and $1.83 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The majority of these orders will be filled within one year. Order backlog
within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

For the past decade, Nucor has focused on securing access to

low-cost

raw material inputs as they are the Company’s largest expense. Nucor’s broad,
balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations, create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs. Our investment in DRI production facilities and
scrap yards, as well as our access to international



raw materials markets, provides Nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw material costs. Additionally, having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control
minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials, particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil. Continued successful
implementation of our raw material strategy, including key investments in DRI production, coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at DJJ, give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus help us
mitigate the risk of significant price fluctuations in input costs.

The primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are
ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes, such as pig iron, DRI and HBI. On average, it takes approximately 1.1 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel. DJJ operates six regional scrap companies within the United States that have a
combined annual scrap processing capability of approximately 5,000,000 tons. DJJ acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources, including manufacturers of products made from steel, industrial plants, scrap dealers, peddlers, auto wreckers and
demolition firms. We purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana with respective capacities of approximately 2,000,000 and 2,500,000 metric tons annually. The primary raw material for our
DRI facilities is iron ore, which we purchase from various international suppliers.

In October 2016, Nucor concluded several
transactions to improve its access to a long-term supply of natural gas. Nucor purchased 49% of Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc.’s (“Encana”) leasehold interest covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin. The
determination of whether or not to participate and invest in all future drilling capital investment by one working interest owner is independent of the other working interest owners. As such, Nucor has full discretion on its participation in all
future drilling capital investments. Nucor retains all existing producing wells it currently owns. To support Nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on the approximately 54,000 acres, Nucor has entered into long-term
agreements directly with existing third-party gathering and processing service providers.

The primary raw material for our
steel products segment is steel produced by Nucor’s steel mills.

DJJ generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap
for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in Nucor’s steel mills. DJJ does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number
of major sources. The availability and price of ferrous scrap and other metallic inputs such as iron ore are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products.

Energy Consumption and Costs

Our steel mills are large consumers of
electricity and natural gas. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas. Consequently, we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas, including cash flow hedges and our
natural gas drilling operations.

Historically, manufacturers in the United States have benefited from relatively stable and
competitive energy costs. The availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today by many factors, including fuel switching (coal to natural gas by public utilities), changes in supply and demand, and pipeline and export
infrastructure expansion. Because energy is such a significant cost for Nucor, we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient. We also closely monitor developments in public policy relating
to energy production and consumption. When appropriate, we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

Our business operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment. The principal federal environmental laws include the Clean Air Act that
regulates air



emissions; the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) that regulates water discharges and withdrawals; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”) that addresses solid and
hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “CERCLA”) that governs releases of, and remediation of, sites contaminated by hazardous substances. Our
operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws.

We believe that
we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations.

Nucor uses EAFs to recycle scrap metal and scrap substitutes into new steel products. These EAFs use electricity as their primary source of energy. As the Trump administration revisits any number of
recently implemented environmental regulations, such as greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations, air toxics rules and emissions standards imposed on coal-fired electric utilities, it is reasonable to assume that any cost implications would be
delayed until those reviews are complete.

The CWA regulates water discharges and withdrawals. Nucor maintains discharge and
withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the CWA and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits. Nucor also maintains permits from local governments for
the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available.

The RCRA establishes standards for the management
of solid and hazardous wastes. The RCRA also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes. While Nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these
regulations, past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered. These activities and

off-site

properties that the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has determined are contaminated, for which Nucor may be potentially responsible at some level, are quickly evaluated and corrected. While Nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of
completing some cleanups under the RCRA, these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved.

Because Nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials, Nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major
cleanups under the CERCLA for which Nucor has been named a potentially responsible party. Nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and, if appropriate, maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities.
Under the RCRA, private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs. Nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently
identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves
established for them.

The primary raw material of Nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal. The process of
recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint, zinc, chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment. This filtrant (EAF dust) is classified as a listed hazardous
waste under the RCRA. Because these contaminants contain valuable metals, this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals. Nucor sends all but a small fraction of the EAF dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc, lead, chrome
and other valuable metals from this dust. By recycling this material, Nucor is not only acting in a sustainable, responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the CERCLA and the RCRA.

Nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee, as well as
management responsibility for environmental performance. All of Nucor’s steelmaking operations are ISO 14001 certified. Achieving ISO 14001 certification means that each of Nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in
place with measurable targets and objectives, such as



reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use, and has implemented site-wide recycling programs. Many of our facilities have incorporated energy efficiency targets to reduce
both cost and environmental impacts into their environmental management systems. These environmental management systems help facilitate compliance with our environmental commitment, which is every Nucor teammate’s responsibility. Nucor’s
environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training, commitment, outreach and visibility.

Capital expenditures
at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be less than $100 million per year.

Employees

Nucor has a simple, streamlined organizational structure to
allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate. Our organization is highly decentralized, with most

day-to-day

operating decisions made by our division
general managers and their staff. We have slightly more than 100 employees in our principal executive offices. The vast majority of Nucor’s approximately 26,300 employees as of December 31, 2018 are not represented by labor unions.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may
negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The current global steelmaking
capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel. According to the Organisation for Economic

Co-operation

and Development, global steel production overcapacity was approximately 600 million tons
at the end of 2017, with nearly half that amount located in China. Overcapacity is down from its peak in 2015 and 2016. Efforts by China to close inefficient steel production and improve air quality, steel mill closures in Europe and stronger global
economic growth all contributed to reduce excess capacity.

During periods of global economic weakness, this overcapacity is
amplified because of weaker global demand. This excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. In some countries
the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. These imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency
conversion rates, and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Section 232 steel tariffs are keeping dumped steel products out of the U.S. market. International efforts to reduce global steel
production overcapacity, such as the

G-20

Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, are



ongoing. The U.S. government is also negotiating new or renegotiating existing trade agreements, which provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity. Should these efforts
fail to reduce excess capacity and the Section 232 tariffs be lifted, U.S. steelmakers would be at risk of having to compete again against steel products dumped in the U.S. market.

Our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business.

Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Our business supports cyclical
industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. As a result, downturns in the U.S. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows. General economic conditions in the United States and steel demand in this country are currently stronger than in many parts of the world, but challenges from global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing
uncertainties in other regions of the world remain.

While we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry
remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions. Future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows.

Competition from other steel producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business.

We face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. The
steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. Depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and availability, energy, technology, labor and
capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces.

In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood. Increased use of
these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products.

Since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new Corporate Average Fuel Economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. As automobile
producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel in North
America. Certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015.

The
results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel.

We rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of
our steel products. The raw material required to produce DRI is pelletized iron ore. Although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana and also acquiring DJJ, we still must purchase most
of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the United States. Although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw
materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors. At any given



time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. The availability and prices of raw materials may also be
negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. Many
countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. This trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to
compete in the U.S. market.

If our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative
sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or
part of the increased cost of the raw materials. Also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. This could cause us to lose
sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation.

Changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are
subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business.

Our steel mills are large consumers of
electricity and natural gas. In addition, our DRI facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of
electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover
increased energy costs. Disruptions, including physical or information systems related issues that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. Increases in our energy
costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our steelmaking processes, our DRI processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive
and generate carbon dioxide and other GHGs. The regulation of these GHGs through new rulemaking or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Carbon is an essential raw material in Nucor’s production processes. As a carbon steel producer, Nucor could be
increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent GHG regulations are further implemented. Because our operations are subject to most of these new GHG regulations, we are already impacted in the permit modification and
reporting processes. Both GHG regulations and recently promulgated National Air Ambient Quality Standards, which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing
permits.

These same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and
continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. The discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is mitigating
some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. However, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of
converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. In 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule to replace the promulgated Clean Power Plan that was driving
many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants. However, there is a significant degree of uncertainty with respect to the results of this change in regulatory direction. To the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an
increase in the cost of energy, they could have an impact on Nucor’s competitive position.



While the federal government appears to be moving to relax burdensome regulations, some
states are moving to enact their own regulations of carbon and other GHG emissions. If such regulations are enacted in states in which Nucor does business, it could negatively affect those operations. Numerous states, including California,
Washington, Oregon and New York, are considering or have passed laws using Environmental Product Declarations (“EPD”) to evaluate environmental impacts of products. The impacts identified by EPDs could impact future state/consumer
purchasing decisions. California has implemented the “Buy Clean California Act” and California is currently requesting EPDs from manufacturers to be used in State of California funded projects. EPDs will be required for certain materials
including some steel products after January 1, 2020. Global Warming Potentials (“GWP”) will be established by January 1, 2021 for applicable product categories and EPDs will be used to determine product compliance to the GWP
limits. Because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. In addition to increased costs
of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment.

Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the
environment, and accordingly, we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these
estimates. Nucor has implemented the revised EPA rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. The new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling
materials. Increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the United States to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. To the extent that competitors,
particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. If one of our permits is
revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash
flows.

We acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire.

We plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that
strengthen Nucor. Realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. Our business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses.

Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses.

The steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents,
natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. While our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our
results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance.

We are
subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such
as



intellectual property and proprietary business information. Despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures
could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. These risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically
produce steel, resulting in lost revenues, as well as delays in reporting our financial results. We also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach, including to repair or
replace networks and information technology systems, liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.

Our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements.

Our operations are capital intensive. For the five-year period ended December 31, 2018, our total capital expenditures, excluding
acquisitions, were approximately $3.1 billion. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. Although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for
financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds, short-term commercial paper issuance or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the
case. Additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources.

Risks associated with operating in
international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

Certain of our
businesses and investments are located outside of the United States, in Europe, Mexico and in emerging markets. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. These risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political
or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws, and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977. These risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our reported results of operations and financial
position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.

The accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings.

We periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value
is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. The results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general
economic conditions. If we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a

non-cash

impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations.

Tax increases and
changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results.

The steel industry and our business are
sensitive to changes in taxes. As a company based in the United States, Nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in U.S. tax laws than some of our major competitors. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be
adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws.



We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.

We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal
standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual,
import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” A negative
outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs,
the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop
strategies to manage them.



Interest Rate Risk

– Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a
combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2018, approximately 24% of Nucor’s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. The remaining 76% of
Nucor’s long-term debt was at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. Nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. As of
December 31, 2018, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant
impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments.

Commodity Price Risk

– In
the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the best prices for
our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to
effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. When demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana
provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. DRI is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production.

Natural gas produced by Nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of
natural gas consumed by our Louisiana DRI facility and our steel mills in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 15% of the volume of natural gas
purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and DRI facilities.

Nucor also periodically uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. Gains and losses from derivatives
designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2018,
accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes included $6.5 million in unrealized

net-of-tax

losses for the fair value of these derivative
instruments. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. The following table presents the negative effect on

pre-tax

earnings of a
hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2018, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands):

Commodity Derivative

10% Change

25% Change

Natural gas

$

11,768

$

29,420

Aluminum

4,370

10,905

Copper


1,770

Any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive
loss, net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. These hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities.

Foreign Currency Risk

– Nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in Canada, Europe and
Mexico. We periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were insignificant
