PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Nucor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1958. The business of Nucor Corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and
steel products, which accounted for the majority of the sales and earnings in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The earnings in 2005 include other income of $9.2 million in settlement of claims against third parties related to environmental matters.

Nucor is North America’s largest recycler, using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products. In 2007, we recycled
approximately 21 million tons of scrap steel.

Segments

Nucor reports its results in the following segments: steel mills and steel products. Net sales to external customers, intercompany sales, depreciation expense, earnings before income taxes, assets and capital
expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 as well as geographic information for the two years ended December 31, 2007, are set forth in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
of the 2007 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference.

Principal Products Produced

Principal products from the steel mills segment are hot-rolled steel (angles, rounds, flats, channels, sheet, wide-flange beams, pilings, billets, blooms,
beam blanks and plate) and cold-rolled steel. Principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems,
light gauge steel framing, steel grating and expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. Hot-rolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap, utilizing electric arc furnaces, continuous casting and automated rolling mills. Cold-rolled steel, cold
finished steel, steel joists and joist girders, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, grating and expanded metal, cold drawn wire and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hot-rolled steel. Steel deck, light gauge steel framing
and wire mesh are manufactured from cold-rolled and cold drawn steel.

Markets and Marketing

In the steel mills segment, hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders. In addition, other hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel
are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained. In 2007, approximately 92% of the steel mills segment production was sold to non-affiliated customers; the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment. Hot-rolled
steel and cold-rolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers, fabricators and manufacturers throughout the United States. In 2007, approximately 50% of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made
in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale. These contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months.

In the steel products segment, steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the United
States. Substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained. The majority of sales contracts are firm fixed-price contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers. Longer term
contracts may permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs. Reinforcing products are sold on a construction contract bid basis. Product applications include highways, bridges, reservoirs, utilities, hospitals,
schools, airports, stadiums and high-rise buildings. Cold finished steel, steel fasteners, steel grating, wire and wire mesh are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained. Cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold
primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the United States and Canada.



Item 1.

Business, continued

Products from both segments are marketed mainly through in-house sales forces. The principal competitive factors are price and service. The markets that
Nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions. Considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports. Unfairly traded steel imports have devastated
the U.S. steel industry and its workers. We have continued the aggressive trade case work in which we have engaged over the years with our participation in the current statutory five-year sunset reviews of existing duties. In late 2006, the United
States International Trade Commission chose to remove the duties that were in place on many of the countries involved in dumping these products into the United States. As a result, more foreign steel may continue to enter our borders with negative
effects on our business. We will continue to fight illegally dumped foreign steel in support of free and fair trade through the legal process. In 2007, Nucor aggressively supported the adoption of a Chinese Currency bill that would identify the
mercantilist practices of currency manipulation that result in distorted trade, an insurmountable trade deficit and the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States. Several bills were generated in the House and Senate, but none were put into
law. Our effort was broad, reaching across multiple industries, and ultimately drew attention to the domestic manufacturing job loss issue. In 2008, we hope that newly proposed legislation will unite Congress in an effort to maintain and enforce
laws ensuring free and fair trade. Nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and that oppose currency manipulation.

Backlog

In the steel mills segment, Nucor's backlog of orders was approximately $2.74 billion and $2.52 billion at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Nucor's backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately $1.51 billion and $572.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This increase in backlog of orders is due to
the numerous acquisitions in the steel products segment in 2007. The majority of these orders will be filled within one year.

Raw Materials

The primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap, which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country.
With the escalation of scrap steel prices in 2003 and 2004, years in which prices increased 25% and 74%, respectively, Nucor successfully implemented a raw material sales price surcharge in 2004. This surcharge has helped offset the impact of
significantly more volatile scrap prices and allowed us to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ orders. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton remained at historically high levels in 2006 and 2007, increasing slightly
from $244 per ton in 2005 to $246 per ton in 2006 and increasing 13% to $278 in 2007. The primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel, which is almost entirely purchased from the steel mills segment.

The steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas. Nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas purchase contracts to partially
manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process. Historically, U.S.-based manufacturers have enjoyed competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on equal footing in what is becoming more
and more a global market. In recent decades, our government has allowed a growing over-reliance on natural gas for the generation of electricity, while delaying or halting the construction of new coal-fired and nuclear power plants. At the same
time, our government has prevented access to some of the most promising areas for natural gas exploration. As a result, natural gas prices have increased from less than $2.00 per mmbtu in the 1990’s (NYMEX Henry-Hub pricing) to a peak of more
than $15.00 per mmbtu in December 2005 and to a calendar 2008 average price currently exceeding $8.00 per mmbtu. Since an increasing share of electricity is now generated using natural gas, higher natural gas prices are also increasing costs for
consumers of electricity. Nucor actively supports several organizations that are promoting a more rational energy policy. We believe this is critical for not only our future business success, but also for the future of the U.S. economy. Supplies of
raw materials and energy have been, and are expected to be, adequate to operate our facilities.

Strategy

Nucor has historically focused on greenfield growth and on optimizing existing operations
in order to keep them state-of-the-art and globally competitive. Capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately $800 million in 2008, an increase of more than 50% from 2007. While more than $300 million of the 2008 capital spending
is allocated to our greenfield projects, the remainder is an estimate of what we will spend to maintain the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities. In recent years, our focus has expanded to include growing profitably through
acquisitions and through joint ventures that leverage new technologies.

Recent Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Greenfield Projects

Nucor’s acquisitions over the past few years have strengthened our position as North America’s most diversified producer of steel and steel
products. This diversity has been a significant factor in Nucor’s profitability.

The annual capacity of Nucor’s downstream
value-added products has more than doubled since late 2006 to just under four million tons. We have done this with our very successful acquisitions of Verco Manufacturing Company in steel decking; Harris Steel Group Inc. in rebar fabrication, cold
finished bars and metal grating; LMP Steel & Wire Company in cold finished bars; Magnatrax Corporation in metal buildings; and Nelson Steel, Inc. in wire mesh. We are looking forward to growing the already strong returns generated by these
businesses.

We continue to increase our presence in the steel mills segment through greenfield projects such as our special bar quality
(“SBQ”) mill in Memphis, Tennessee, which will have an estimated annual capacity of 850,000 tons. Complementing our mills in South Carolina and Nebraska, the Memphis mill positions Nucor to provide the most diverse, highest quality and
lowest cost SBQ offering in North America. We are encouraged by the strong level of marketplace interest in what Memphis will be able to provide our customers. Production start-up is on schedule for the second quarter of this year.

Another greenfield project is the Castrip

®

facility under construction in Blytheville, Arkansas. Nucor began operations of its 100% owned Castrip facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 2002. This facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting, to which Nucor holds
exclusive rights in the United States and Brazil. Strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling, allowing lower investment and operating costs, reduced energy consumption
and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology. This process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions. In 2007, the Castrip facility in Indiana
continued setting monthly production and shipping records. In 2005, we selected Blytheville, Arkansas, as the location for our second Castrip production facility. The Arkansas Castrip facility is expected to begin operating in the second half of
2008. We continue to explore potential new joint ventures utilizing the Castrip technology.

Raw Materials Projects

Recently, we expanded our vertical integration strategy to include upstream control of raw materials. Nucor’s raw materials strategy includes the
goal of controlling approximately 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 tons per year of high quality scrap substitutes for consumption by the steel mills.

Implementation of Nucor’s raw materials strategy is off to an excellent start with 2007’s very successful start-up of Nu-Iron Unlimited, our direct reduced iron (“DRI”) plant in Trinidad. In its start-up year, Nu-Iron
established itself as one of the world’s most productive DRI facilities, producing over 1.4 million metric tons of DRI. We expect to produce 1.8 million metric tons in 2008, and the Nu-Iron team is working on plans to expand this
capacity. The Trinidad site benefits from a low cost supply of natural gas under a long-term contract and from favorable logistics for receipt of Brazilian iron ore and shipment of DRI to the United States.



Item 1.

Business, continued

In 2002, Nucor entered a joint venture with The Rio Tinto Group, Mitsubishi Corporation and Chinese
steelmaker, Shougang Corporation, to construct a commercial HIsmelt

®

plant in Kwinana, Western Australia. The HIsmelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to liquid
metal, eliminating the need for a blast furnace, sinter/pellet plants and coke ovens. Additionally, the HIsmelt technology offers an alternative supply of high-quality iron units as a scrap substitute. Nucor has a 25% interest in the joint venture
that owns the HIsmelt commercial plant. Construction was completed and the start-up of operations began in 2005. This plant has an initial annual capacity of 800,000 metric tons, which is expandable to over 1,500,000 metric tons.

In February 2008, Nucor announced the acquisition of SHV North America Corporation, which owns 100% of The David J. Joseph Company (“DJJ”) and
certain affiliates, for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.44 billion. Since scrap is our largest single cost, this strategic investment provides an ideal growth platform for Nucor to expand its direct ownership in the steel scrap supply
chain and further its raw materials strategy. DJJ operates over 30 scrap processing facilities with an annual capacity to process 3.5 million tons of ferrous scrap. Additionally, DJJ brokers over 20 million tons of ferrous scrap,
internationally sources scrap, pig iron, and scrap substitutes, and brokers ferro-alloys and over one half billion pounds of non-ferrous metals. The DJJ Mill and Industrial Services business provides logistics and metallurgical blending operations
and offers on-site handling and trading of industrial scrap. The DJJ Rail Services business oversees the largest private fleet of rail cars dedicated to scrap movement and offers complete railcar fleet management and leases for third parties. All of
these businesses have strategic value to Nucor as the most diversified North American steel producer. We expect this acquisition to be completed in the first quarter of 2008.

Employees

Nucor has a simple, streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make
quick decisions and to be innovative. Our organization is highly decentralized, with most day-to-day operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff. Only 80 employees are located in our executive offices. The majority of
Nucor's 18,000 employees are engaged in its steel mills and steel products businesses and are not represented by labor unions.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Many of the factors that affect our
business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Item 1A.

Risk Factors, continued

Our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Our business supports cyclical industries such as the
commercial construction, energy, appliance and automotive industries. As a result, downturns in the United States economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Because steel producers
generally have high fixed costs, reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2007, our net earnings have varied from a high of $1.76 billion in 2006 to a low of $64.8 million in 2003. Future
economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.

Global steel-making capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. This excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting
significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices below their cost of production. These imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government
actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Overcapacity in China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel, has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of low-priced, unfairly traded steel and steel products to the United
States. In recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in Chinese market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in
China increasing steel exports.

The results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials,
particularly scrap steel.

We rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials that are critical to the
manufacture of our products. We acquire our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous sources throughout the country. Although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities, purchase prices of these critical raw
materials are subject to volatility and growing scrap exports to satisfy the scrap demand of global competitors. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable
to us.

If our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to
the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the
raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004. Also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture
sufficient quantities of our products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation.

Changes in the
availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business.

Our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil
and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by weather and political and economic factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the supply of



Item 1A.

Risk Factors, continued

our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. Increases in our energy costs could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our steel making processes, and the manufacturing processes
of many of our customers and suppliers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other “Greenhouse Gasses” (GHG’s).

In 2007, several bills were introduced in the United States Senate that would regulate GHG and carbon dioxide emissions. This legislation, when adopted, will increase our energy and other operating costs. This legislation
regulates domestic production but excludes imports from the same standards for a period of eight years, which will make domestic manufacturing uncompetitive with imported products during this time. These increased costs could also encourage
more of our customers to relocate their manufacturing facilities to foreign countries that do not regulate GHG emissions and where Nucor is not positioned to sell or distribute our products. This legislation is also likely to increase energy costs
for all U.S. consumers resulting in a weaker domestic economy.

We plan to continue to implement acquisition strategies and may encounter difficulties
in integrating businesses we acquire.

We plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint
ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. Realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses with our operations and to
cooperate with our strategic partners. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses.

In addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the U.S., which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations,
changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies.

Competition from other materials may materially adversely
affect our business.

In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic
and wood. Increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could materially adversely affect prices and demand for our steel products.

Congress has recently raised the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks produced beginning in 2011. Automobile producers may reduce the steel content of
cars and trucks to achieve the new CAFE fuel economy standards, reducing demand for steel and resulting in an over-supply in North America.

Our
operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses.

The steel-making business is subject to numerous inherent risks,
particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. While our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and
cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance.

Our business requires substantial capital
investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements.

Our
operations are capital intensive. For the five-year period ended December 31, 2007, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $1.69 billion. Our business also requires substantial



Item 1A.

Risk Factors, continued

expenditures for routine maintenance. Although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for
financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions could require
financing from external sources.

Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact
our competitive position.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection
of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. These laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. To the extent that
competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive steel products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted.

Changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results.

Some of our steel products and other subsidiaries conduct their business in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, their results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates
prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate to fewer U.S. dollars.

The accounting treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings.

We periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by the market
conditions noted above, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. If impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments

None.



Item 2.

Properties

Our principal operating facilities by segment are as follows:

Our steel mills segment also includes a distribution center in Pompano Beach, Florida.

In the steel products segment, we have 22 additional operating facilities in 16 states. Harris Steel has 29 operating facilities in 18 states and 33
operating facilities in Canada and other foreign locations.

During 2007, the average utilization rates of all operating facilities in the
steel mills and steel products segments were approximately 87% and 77% of production capacity, respectively.

We also own our principal
executive office in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Nucor is involved in various
judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant, arising in the ordinary course of business. Nucor does not believe that any such proceedings (including matters relating to contracts, torts, taxes, warranties and insurance)
will have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Nucor has increased its base cash dividend every year since the Company began paying dividends in 1973. In 2007, in addition to increasing the base
dividend, the board of directors approved a supplemental dividend based on Nucor’s strong performance during the year. As a result, Nucor paid a total dividend of $2.43 per share in 2007 compared with $1.88 per share in 2006. In February 2008,
the board of directors approved a 7% increase in Nucor’s quarterly base dividend to $0.32 per share and announced a supplemental dividend of $0.20 per share, for a total quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share. The payment of any future
supplemental dividends depends on Nucor’s earnings, cash flows and financial position during the balance of the current year, all of which could be adversely affected by many factors, including many over which the Company has little or no
control. See the discussion of the factors that affect Nucor’s business and operations and involve risk and uncertainty in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Additional information regarding the market for Nucor’s common stock, quarterly market price ranges, the number of stockholders and dividend
payments is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2007 Annual Report, page 62.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them.

Interest Rate Risk

—Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2007,
19% of Nucor’s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. The remaining 81% of Nucor’s debt is at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to
significantly impact earnings. Nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2007, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucor’s investment practice is to invest in
securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities.

Commodity Price Risk

—In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy,
principally scrap steel and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. Nucor has
a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials. Our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain
our gross margins.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, continued

Nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the
production process when management believes it is prudent to do so. Gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of
products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2007, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes $4.0 million in unrealized net-of-tax gains for the fair value of these derivative
instruments. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10% and 25% in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by $32.5 million and $81.3
million, respectively. Any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Because these instruments are structured and used as hedges, these hypothetical losses would be
offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle.

Foreign Currency
Risk

—Prior to the acquisition of Harris Steel, Nucor was principally a domestic manufacturer of steel and steel products with customers located primarily in the U.S. Nucor was exposed to currency fluctuations, however, due to its joint
ventures in Brazil and Australia and the direct reduced iron facility in Trinidad. When the Company entered into the agreement to acquire Harris Steel in January 2007, Nucor became exposed to Canadian currency fluctuations and hedged a portion
of the exposure associated with the closing of the transaction in March 2007. The Company continues to be exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in Canada.

Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date.

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

—There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

—Management’s report on

internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 are incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2007 Annual Report, pages 37 and 38.
