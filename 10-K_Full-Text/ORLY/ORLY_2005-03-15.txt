                                                                PART I
Item 1.  Business

General

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. is one of the largest  specialty  retailers  of
automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the
United States,  selling our products to both do-it-yourself  (DIY) customers and
professional  installers.  At December  31,  2004,  we operated  1,249 stores in
Alabama, Arkansas,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Nebraska,  North Carolina,  Oklahoma, South
Carolina,  Tennessee,  Texas and Virginia. Our stores carry an extensive product
line consisting of:

o    new  and  remanufactured   automotive  hard  parts,  such  as  alternators,
     starters,  fuel pumps, water pumps, brake shoes and pads, chassis parts and
     engine parts;

o    maintenance items, such as oil,  antifreeze,  fluids,  engine additives and
     appearance products;

o    accessories, such as floor mats and seat covers; and

o    a complete line of autobody paint and related  materials,  automotive tools
     and professional service equipment.

     We do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations.

     We were  founded  in 1957 by Charles F.  O'Reilly  and his son,  Charles H.
''Chub''   O'Reilly,   Sr.  and  initially  operated  from  a  single  store  in
Springfield,  Missouri.  The O'Reilly  family has managed the Company  since our
inception.

     Our goal is to continue  to achieve  growth in sales and  profitability  by
capitalizing  on  our  competitive  advantages  and  executing  our  growth  and
expansion strategies.

     Our Internet address is www.oreillyauto.com.  Interested readers can access
the  Company's  annual  reports  on Form 10-K,  quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q,
current  reports  on Form 8-K,  and any  amendments  to those  reports  filed or
furnished  pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended,  through the  Securities and Exchange  Commissions  website at
www.sec.gov.  Such  reports are  generally  available on the day they are filed.
Additionally,  the Company will furnish  interested readers a paper copy of such
reports, upon request, free of charge.

     See "Risk Factors"  beginning on page 11 for a description of certain risks
relevant to our  business.  These risk  factors  include,  among  others,  risks
related  to  competition  in the  automotive  aftermarket  business,  our growth
strategy,  our acquisition  strategy,  our sensitivity to regional  economic and
weather  conditions,  our  dependence  upon  key  and  other  personnel  and the
significant voting control held by our principal shareholders.






Competitive Advantages

     Proven  Ability to Execute  Dual Market  Strategy.  We have an  established
track record of serving  both DIY  customers  and  professional  installers.  We
believe  our  ability  to  execute  a  dual  market  strategy  is a  competitive
advantage, which enables us to:

o    target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts;

o    capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure;

o    profitably  operate  both in  large  markets  and  less  densely  populated
     geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors; and

o    enhance  service  levels  offered to our DIY  customers by offering a broad
     selection of stock  keeping units (SKUs) and  extensive  product  knowledge
     required by professional installers.

     We have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years.  For
2004, we derived  approximately  52% of our product sales from our DIY customers
and approximately 48% from our professional installer customers.  As a result of
our  historical  success  in  executing  our dual  market  strategy  and our 172
full-time sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer,   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market.

     Superior  Customer  Service.  We seek to attract  new DIY and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service, the key elements of which include:

o    superior in-store service through highly-motivated,  technically proficient
     store personnel  (Professional  Parts People) using advanced  point-of-sale
     systems;

o    an extensive selection of products;

o    attractive stores in convenient locations; and

o    competitive pricing, with a low price guarantee.

     Technically  Proficient  Professional  Parts People.  Our highly proficient
Professional Parts People provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage,
particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional
Parts People to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve
the  technically-oriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis.  Such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our DIY customers,  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our Professional Parts People.

     Strategic   Distribution   Systems.   We   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store  network in nineteen,  contiguous  states  (Alabama,
Arkansas,   Florida,  Georgia,   Illinois,   Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,
Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Nebraska,  North Carolina,  Oklahoma, South
Carolina,  Tennessee, Texas and Virginia) and the strategic locations of our ten
distribution  centers enable us to maintain optimum  inventory levels throughout
our store  network.  In addition,  our  inventory  management  and  distribution
systems  electronically  link  each  of our  stores  to a  distribution  center,
providing for  efficient  inventory  control and  management.  Our  distribution
system  provides  each of our stores with same day or  overnight  access to over
100,000  SKUs,  many of which are hard to find  items not  typically  stocked by
other parts retailers.  We believe the availability of a broad range of products
is a key  competitive  advantage in satisfying  customer  demand and  generating
repeat business.

     Experienced Management Team. Our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan,  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic  acquisitions.  We have experienced  twelve consecutive
years of record  revenues and earnings growth since becoming a public company in
April  1993.  We  have  a  strong  senior   management   team  comprised  of  60
professionals  who  average  over 16  years  of  experience  with  O'Reilly.  In
addition,  our 90 corporate managers average over 13 years of experience with us
and our 117 district managers average over 9 years of experience with us.




Growth and Expansion Strategies

     Aggressively  Open New Stores.  We intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new, contiguous markets. We plan to open approximately 160 stores in
2005 and  approximately  170-180 stores in 2006. A majority of the sites for our
proposed  2005 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2006
store openings have been identified.  In selecting sites for new stores, we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management,  advertising  and
distribution.

     We target  both small  (population  less than  100,000)  and large  markets
(population greater than 100,000) for expansion of our store network. Of the 140
net, new stores added in 2004,  30 are located in Alabama,  2 in Arkansas,  3 in
Florida, 14 in Georgia, 13 in Illinois, 2 in Indiana, 1 in Iowa, 1 in Kansas, 14
in Kentucky,  6 in  Louisiana,  15 in  Mississippi,  10 in Missouri,  6 in North
Carolina,  1 in Oklahoma,  1 in South Carolina,  15 in Tennessee and 6 in Texas.
While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, more aggressive competition
in the  more  densely  populated  markets,  we  believe  that we  have  competed
effectively, and that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively,
in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within
these markets. We also believe that because of our dual market strategy,  we are
better  able to  operate  stores in less  densely  populated  areas  within  our
regional market,  which would not otherwise support a national or regional chain
store selling to one portion of the market or the other. Consequently, we expect
to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas.

     To date,  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to O'Reilly stores. We typically open new
stores either by (i) constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and
stocking  the new store  with  fixtures  and  inventory,  or (ii)  acquiring  an
independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially
all of the inventory  and other assets (other than realty) of such store.  Store
sites are  strategically  located  in  clusters  within  geographic  areas  that
complement  our  distribution  system in order to achieve  economies of scale in
management, advertising and distribution costs. Other key factors we consider in
the site selection process include population  density and growth patterns,  age
and per capita income,  vehicle traffic counts,  the number and type of existing
automotive  repair  facilities,  other  competing  auto parts stores,  and other
competitors within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such
competitors.  When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale.

     Same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy.   To  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business,   it  is  customer  satisfaction  (whether  of  the  DIY  consumer  or
professional installer), resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability.

     Selectively   Pursue  Strategic   Acquisitions.   Although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented,  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains, such as O'Reilly, to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation.  Thus,  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer.

     Continually Enhance Store Design and Location.  Our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage,  higher ceilings,
more convenient  interior store layouts,  brighter  lighting,  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers,  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service.  We continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design.  We  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network,  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers.




Products and Purchasing

     Our stores offer DIY and professional  installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles,
vans  and  trucks.  We do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations.  Our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized,
well-advertised,  name brand products such as AC Delco,  Moog,  Murray,  Wagner,
Gates Rubber, Federal Mogul, Monroe, Prestone, Quaker State, Pennzoil,  Castrol,
Valvoline, STP, BWD, Cardone, Wix, Armor All and Turtle Wax. In addition to name
brand products,  our stores carry a wide variety of  high-quality  private label
products under our O'Reilly Auto Parts,  SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Ultima, Master
Pro and  Omnispark  proprietary  name brands.  Because most of our private label
products are produced by nationally recognized  manufacturers in accordance with
our specifications,  we believe that the private label products are generally of
equal or, in some cases,  better quality than comparable name brand products,  a
characteristic which is important to our professional  installer  clientele.  We
further  believe that the private label  products are packaged  attractively  to
promote  customer  interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand
products carried in our stores.

     We purchase  automotive  products from approximately 530 vendors,  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 37% of our total purchases in 2004.
Our  largest  vendor  in  2004  accounted  for  approximately  18% of our  total
purchases  and  the  next  four  largest  vendors  accounted  for 4 - 7% of such
purchases each. We have no long-term  contractual  purchase commitments with any
of our vendors,  nor have we  experienced  difficulty in obtaining  satisfactory
alternative  sources of supply for automotive parts. We believe that alternative
supply sources exist at  substantially  similar  costs,  for  substantially  all
automotive  products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment
and  seasonal  purchasing  discounts  offered  by our  vendors,  and to  utilize
extended  dating terms available from vendors due to volume  purchasing.  During
2004,  we entered into various  programs  and  arrangements  with certain of our
vendors  that  provide  for  extended  dating and  payment  terms for  inventory
purchases,  including  pay-on-scan  arrangements.  We consider our relationships
with our suppliers to be good.

Inflation and Seasonality

     We have  been  successful,  in many  cases,  in  reducing  the  effects  of
merchandise  cost increases  principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive
programs,  economies of scale  resulting from increased  volume of purchases and
selective  forward  buying.  As a result,  we do not believe our operations have
been materially affected by inflation.

     Our business is seasonal to some extent primarily as a result of the impact
of weather  conditions on store sales. Store sales and profits have historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  (April through  September) of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters.




Store Network

     Store Locations.  As a result of our dual market  strategy,  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large,  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas that would not otherwise  support a national or regional  chain
selling to just one portion of the automotive  aftermarket.  The following table
sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores:



     Our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   23,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately  6,700 total square feet in size.  At December 31, 2004,  we had a
total of approximately  8.3 million square feet in our 1,249 stores.  Our stores
are served primarily by the nearest distribution center, but also have access to
the broader  selection of inventory  available at one of our 85 Master Inventory
Stores,   which  on  average  carry   approximately   36,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately 8,800 square feet in size. Master Inventory Stores, in addition to
serving DIY and professional  installer customers in their markets, also provide
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of SKUs on a
same-day basis.

     We believe that our stores are ''destination  stores'' generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity.  Consequently,  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares,  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access.

     Store  Layout.  We  utilize a  computer-assisted  ''plan-o-grammed''  store
layout  system to provide a uniform  and  consistent  merchandise  presentation;
however,  some  variation  occurs  in  order  to meet  the  specific  needs of a
particular market area.  Merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access
and maximum selling space, keeping high-turnover products and accessories within
view of the customer.  Aisle displays are generally used to feature  high-demand
or seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.

     Store  Automation.  To enhance store level operations and customer service,
we use IBM AS/400  computer  systems in all of our  stores.  These  systems  are
linked  with  the IBM  AS/400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers. Our point-of-sale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make,  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise.  This
system speeds  transaction  times,  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service.   Moreover,   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management,  strategic  planning,  inventory
control and distribution efficiency.




     New Store Site  Selection.  In selecting  sites for new stores,  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management,  advertising and  distribution.  Other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include:

o    population density and growth patterns;

o    age and per capita income;

o    vehicle traffic counts;

o    the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities; and

o    the  number  of  auto  parts   stores  and  other   competitors   within  a
     pre-determined radius and the operational strength of such competitors.

     When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale.  After  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores,  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas. This strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market.

Distribution System

     The  following  table sets  forth the  distribution  centers  we  currently
operate:


     Adjacent to the Springfield,  Missouri  distribution  center,  we operate a
36,000 square foot bulk merchandise  warehouse used for the distribution of bulk
products such as motor oil,  antifreeze,  batteries,  lubricants  and other fast
moving  bulk  products,  and a 22,000  square  foot  returned  goods  processing
facility, that is included in the above square footage. We also operate a 17,500
square  foot bulk  warehouse  in  McAllen,  Texas that  serves  the  surrounding
distribution centers with bulk products.

     Our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems,  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis.  The  distribution  centers
utilize  computer-assisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores.  In  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores, we have established a  satellite-based  data interchange
system among those stores in which  high-speed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available,  the distribution  center, which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters.

     We  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventory-carrying   costs,   improving  our  store  in-stock   positions,   and
controlling and managing our inventory.  Moreover, we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores,  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas.
Our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center.  As part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network, in 2005 we plan to:




o    continue to implement  improvement plans to increase  inventory turnover in
     all distribution centers; and

o    implement a hands free/eyes free voice picking system; and

o    upgrade  material  handling  equipment  in  several   distribution  centers
     including conveyor systems, forklifts and racking.

Marketing

     Marketing  to the  DIY  Customer.  We  aggressively  promote  sales  to DIY
customers through an extensive advertising program,  which includes direct mail,
newspaper, radio and television advertising in selected markets. We believe that
our  advertising and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant  name
recognition in each of our market areas.  Newspaper and radio advertisements are
generally directed towards specific product and price promotions,  frequently in
connection  with  specific sale events and  promotions.  To promote sales to car
enthusiasts,  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally, we sponsor 16 nationally televised races and
over 288  motorsports  races and car shows at over 200  facilities in 18 states,
including, 3 NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series Races, 2 NASCAR Busch Series Races in
Dallas,  5 National  Hotrod Racing  Association  races,  as well as the O'Reilly
Chili Bowl.  O'Reilly  Auto Parts is the  "official  auto parts  store" of Texas
Motor Speedway, Kansas Speedway,  Bristol Motor Speedway,  Houston Raceway Park,
Texas  Motorplex,   Memphis  Motorsports  Park,  Heartland  Park  and  Talladega
Speedway.

     Beginning in 2003,  we started  work on branding  the O'Reilly  name in the
National  Collegiate  Athletic  Association,  also known as the NCAA.  Our first
initiative  was to  partner  with  Texas  Tech  University  through a variety of
programs  including  sponsoring of a television show featuring Bobby Knight, the
coach  of the  men's  basketball  team at Texas  Tech  University,  placing  the
O'Reilly  logo on the home  basketball  court and coach  Knight's  sweater,  and
advertising  on the backs of seats and banners for the scoring  table.  This has
lead  to  additional   opportunities   with  approximately  24  colleges  and  3
conferences  in our  current  markets.  We have found that the more  progressive
marketing  concepts  utilized  in the DIY  portion of our  business  can also be
applied to increase sales to our professional installer customers.

     Marketing  to the  Professional  Installer.  We  have  over  172  full-time
O'Reilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve,  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer. Our First Call program, which is
our commitment to the professional  customer,  includes a dedicated sales force,
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer.
Moreover,  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis. Our First Call marketing  strategy,  with respect to professional
installers, emphasizes our ability to offer:

o    prompt delivery using small trucks or vans operated by virtually all of our
     stores;

o    a separate  counter in all of our stores  dedicated  exclusively to serving
     professional installers;

o    trade credit for qualified professional installers;

o    broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing;

o    a  professional  installer  computer  system that connects  directly to our
     inventory system; and

o    seminars concerning topics of interest to professional installers,  such as
     technical updates, safety and general business management.

     Marketing to the Independently  Owned Parts Store. Along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
O'Reilly  stores,  Ozark  Automotive  Distributors,   Inc.  (Ozark)  also  sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an O'Reilly  store.  We generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products,   but  have,  on  occasion,   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by Ozark.  Ozark  operates  its own
separate  marketing program to independently  owned parts stores through a staff
of three.




     Of  the  approximately  215  independently  owned  parts  stores  currently
purchasing  automotive  products from Ozark,  211  participate in the Auto Value
program through Ozark. As a participant in this program,  an independently owned
parts store which meets certain minimum  financial and operational  standards is
permitted to indicate its Auto Value membership  through the display of the Auto
Value logo, which is owned by The Alliance,  Inc.  (formerly known as Auto Value
Associates,  Inc.), a non-profit buying group consisting of approximately  4,500
members as of December 31, 2004, including O'Reilly, engaged in the distribution
or sale  of  automotive  products.  Additionally,  we  provide  advertising  and
promotional  assistance to Auto Value stores purchasing automotive products from
Ozark,  as well as marketing  and sales  support.  In return for a commitment to
purchase  automotive  products from Ozark, we offer  assistance to an Auto Value
independently  owned  parts  store by making  available  computer  software  for
inventory control.

Management Structure

     Each of our  stores  is  staffed  with a  store  manager  and an  assistant
manager, in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet
the specific needs of each store.  Each of our 117 district managers has general
supervisory  responsibility  for an average of 11 stores  within such  manager's
district.

     Each  district  manager  receives  comprehensive  training on a  bi-monthly
basis, focusing on management techniques,  new product  announcements,  advanced
automotive  systems and our policies and  procedures.  In turn, the  information
covered at such bi-monthly meetings is discussed in full by district managers at
bi-monthly  meetings  with their store  managers.  All  assistant  managers  and
manager  trainees  are  required to  successfully  complete a six-month  manager
training program, which includes classroom and field training, as a prerequisite
to becoming a store manager. This program covers operations extensively, as well
as principles of successful management.  Shortly after becoming a store manager,
all managers  attend a manager  development  program,  at the  corporate  office
headquarters,  which includes 40 hours of classroom training.  Upon returning to
the stores,  managers  are given  continuous  field  training  throughout  their
management experience.

     We provide financial  incentives to our district managers,  store managers,
assistant  managers  and sales  specialists  through an  incentive  compensation
program.  Under our incentive  compensation program, base salary is augmented by
incentive  compensation  based upon the  achievement of sales and  profitability
goals.  We  believe  that  our  incentive   compensation  program  significantly
increases the  motivation  and overall  performance  of our  Professional  Parts
People and our  ability to attract  and retain  qualified  management  and other
personnel.

     Most of our current senior management, district managers and store managers
were promoted to their positions from within the Company.  Our senior management
team  averages  16 years of  experience  with the  Company,  corporate  managers
average over 13 years of service and district managers have an average length of
service with the Company of over 9 years.

Professional Parts People

     We  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  Professional  Parts  People  is
essential in providing  superior service both to DIY and professional  installer
customers.  Each of our Professional  Parts People is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer.
In addition,  we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons,  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts.
We believe  that the ability of our  Professional  Parts  People to provide such
assistance  to  the  DIY  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customer's visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
DIY business.




     We  screen  prospective  employees,  whom we refer to as team  members,  to
identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts
or repairs, or an aptitude for automotive  knowledge.  Each person who becomes a
team member first  participates  in an  intensive  two-day  orientation  program
designed to  introduce  the team member to our culture and his or her job duties
before being assigned specific job  responsibilities.  The successful completion
of additional training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a
parts  specialist  and  thus  able to work at the  parts  counter  of one of our
stores. All new counter people are required to successfully complete a six-month
basic  automotive  systems  training course and are then enrolled in a six-month
advanced  automotive  systems course for certification by the National Institute
for Automotive Service  Excellence (ASE),  which administers  national exams for
various  automotive  specialties and requires ASE certified  specialists to take
recertification exams every five years.

     Each of our stores  participates in our sales specialist  training program.
Under this program,  selected team members  complete two days of extensive sales
call  training  for  business  development,  after which these team members will
spend  one day per week  calling  on  existing  and new  professional  installer
customers.  Additionally, each team member engaged in such sales activities will
participate  in  quarterly  advanced  training  programs  for sales and business
development.

Customer Service

     We seek to provide our customers  with an efficient  and pleasant  in-store
experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products.  We believe that the  satisfaction of DIY and
professional installer customers is substantially  dependent upon our ability to
provide,  in a  timely  fashion,  the  specific  automotive  product  requested.
Accordingly,  each  O'Reilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications.   We
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores,  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.

Pricing

     We believe that a competitive  pricing  policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully.  Product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store.  Most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices,  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing.  Consistent
with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any in-stock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors.

Competition

     We  compete  in both the DIY and  professional  installer  portions  of the
automotive aftermarket. We compete primarily with:

o    national and  regional  retail  automotive  parts chains (such as AutoZone,
     Inc.,  Advance Auto Parts,  CSK Auto Corp. and The Pep Boys-Manny,  Moe and
     Jack, Inc.);

o    independently owned parts stores;

o    wholesalers  or jobber stores (some of which are  associated  with national
     automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA and CarQuest);

o    automobile dealers; and

o    mass  merchandisers that carry automotive  replacement  parts,  maintenance
     items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).

     We compete on the basis of customer  service,  which  includes  merchandise
selection and  availability,  price,  helpfulness  of store  personnel and store
layout and location.


Team Members

     As of December 31,  2004,  we had 14,149  full-time  team members and 3,261
part-time team members,  of whom 13,582 were employed at our stores,  2,818 were
employed at our  distribution  centers and 1,010 were  employed at our corporate
and  administrative  headquarters.  Our  team  members  are  not  subject  to  a
collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our team members
to be  excellent,  and strive to promote  good  relations  with our team members
through various programs designed for such purposes.

Servicemarks and Trademarks

     We have  registered the  servicemarks  O'Reilly  Automotive,  O'Reilly Auto
Parts,  and Parts Payoff and the trademarks  SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Omnispark,
First  Call,  Ultima,  and  Master  Pro.  Further,  we are  licensed  to use the
registered  trademarks and servicemarks Auto Value and Parts Master owned by The
Alliance  (formerly  Auto Value  Associates)  in  connection  with our marketing
program.  We believe  that our  business  is not  otherwise  dependent  upon any
patent, trademark, servicemark or copyright.

Regulations

     Although subject to various laws and governmental  regulations  relating to
our business, including those related to the environment, we do not believe that
compliance with such laws and  regulations has a material  adverse effect on our
operations.  Further, we are unaware of any failure to comply with any such laws
and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We
can not give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses
in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation.

Risk Factors

     The risk factors listed in this section, as well as any cautionary language
in this  Form  10-K,  are  subject  to  risks,  uncertainties  and  assumptions,
including, but not limited to, competition,  product demand, the market for auto
parts,  the economy in general,  inflation,  consumer debt levels,  governmental
approvals, our ability to hire and retain qualified employees,  risks associated
with the integration of acquired business,  weather,  terrorist activities,  war
and the threat of war.  Actual  results may materially  differ from  anticipated
results described in these forward-looking  statements. You should be aware that
the  occurrence  of the events  described in these risk factors and elsewhere in
this Form 10-K could have a material  adverse effect on our business,  operating
results and financial condition.

The Automotive Aftermarket Business is Highly Competitive

     Both the DIY and professional installer portions of our business are highly
competitive,  particularly  in the more densely  populated  areas that we serve.
Some of our  competitors  are  larger  than we are and  have  greater  financial
resources.  In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. For a list of our
principal  competitors,  see the ''Competition''  section of Item 1 of this Form
10-K.

We Cannot Assure Future Growth

     We believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future.  Failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock.  Our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather
conditions,  zoning and other issues related to new store site development,  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions.  We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2005 and beyond will be
achieved.  For a  discussion  of our growth  strategies,  see the  ''Growth  and
Expansion Strategies'' section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K.



Acquisitions May Not Lead to Expected Growth

     We expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy.  Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations. For example:

o    we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition  candidates
     or to  acquire  additional  companies  at  favorable  prices  or  on  other
     favorable terms;

o    our management's attention may be distracted;

o    we may fail to retain key acquired personnel;

o    we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; and

o    we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and
     billing  functions,  for  example)  of  businesses  we  acquire  to realize
     economic, operational and other benefits.


Sensitivity to Regional Economic and Weather Conditions

     All of our stores are located in the Central and Southern United States. In
particular, approximately 31% of our stores are located in Texas. Therefore, our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions.
Unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales, particularly to DIY
customers.

Dependence Upon Key and Other Personnel

     Our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel,  including David O'Reilly, Ted Wise, Greg Henslee and Jim Batten. Our
business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the
unexpected  loss  of  the  services  of  one  or  more  of  these   individuals.
Additionally,  our  successful  implementation  and management of our growth and
expansion  strategies  will  depend on our  ability to  continue  to attract and
retain qualified  personnel.  We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue
to attract  such  personnel.  For a further  discussion  of our  management  and
personnel,  see the ''Business'' section of Item 1 and Item 4a of this Form 10-K
and our  Proxy  Statement  on  Schedule  14A  for the  2005  Annual  Meeting  of
Shareholders, a portion of which is incorporated herein.

Significant Voting Block is held by the O'Reilly Family

     As of the date of this Form 10-K,  the O'Reilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  10%, or 5,614,687 number of shares, of the outstanding  shares of
our  common  stock.  As a  result,  the  O'Reilly  family,  if they  act and act
togehter,  represents  one of the  largest  known  blocks of our  shares and may
continue to be a significant  factor in any matter voted on by our shareholders,
including the election of our directors and any merger,  sale of assets or other
change in control.

Possible Volatility of Our Stock Price

     The stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions.  The
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts' expectations.  Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock.  In addition,
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies.  In the past, following periods of volatility in
the market price of a company's  securities,  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company.  If similar  litigation were
instituted  against us, it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our management's attention and resources,  which could have an adverse effect on
our business.

Shares Eligible for Future Sale

     All of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended,  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule. We cannot predict the effect,  if any, that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time.  Sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock,  or the perception  that such sales might occur,  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.




Item 2.  Properties

     The   following   table   provides   certain   information   regarding  our
administrative  offices and distribution  centers and offices as of December 31,
2004:


     Of the 1,249 stores that we operated at December 31, 2004,  455 stores were
owned,  723 stores  were  leased  from  unaffiliated  parties and 71 stores were
leased from one of three  entities  owned by the  O'Reilly  family.  Leases with
unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment
of certain tax, insurance and maintenance  expenses,  and an original term of 10
years,  subject to one or more  renewals at our  option.  We have  entered  into
separate master lease  agreements  with each of the affiliated  entities for the
occupancy of the stores covered thereby.  Such master lease agreements expire on
December 31, 2004. We believe that the lease agreements with the entities are on
terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.

     We  believe  that  our  present  facilities  are  in  good  condition,  are
adequately insured and together with those under construction,  are suitable and
adequate for the conduct of our current operations.



Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

     The Company is involved in various  other legal  proceedings  incidental to
the conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters,  it does not  currently
believe that, in the aggregate,  they will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated  financial  position,  results of  operations  or cash flows of the
Company.

Item 4.       Submission Of Matters To A Vote Of Security Holders

     No matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders,  through  the
solicitation  of proxies or otherwise,  during the fourth  quarter of the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2004.

  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion of our financial condition,  results of operations
and  liquidity  and capital  resources  should be read in  conjunction  with our
consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information
included elsewhere in this annual report.

     We are one of the largest  specialty  retailers of  automotive  aftermarket
parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the United States, selling
our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional installers.
Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and  remanufactured
automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories, and a complete line of
auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service
equipment.

     We calculate  same-store product sales based on the change in product sales
for  stores  open at least  one  year.  Prior to  January  2000,  we  calculated
same-store  product  sales  based on the change in  product  sales of only those
stores open during both full periods being compared. We calculate the percentage
increase in same-store product sales based on store sales results, which exclude
sales of  specialty  machinery,  sales by  outside  salesmen  and  sales to team
members.

     Cost of goods sold  consists  primarily of product  costs and warehouse and
distribution  expenses.  Cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales may
be  affected by  variations  in our product  mix,  price  changes in response to
competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs.

     Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expenses consist primarily
of salaries  and  benefits  for store and  corporate  team  members,  occupancy,
advertising  expenses,  general and  administrative  expenses,  data processing,
professional expenses and other related expenses.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     The  fundamental  objective  of financial  reporting  is to provide  useful
information  that allows a reader to comprehend  the business  activities of our
company. To aid in that  understanding,  management has identified our "critical
accounting  policies."  These  policies  have  the  potential  to  have  a  more
significant  impact  on  our  financial   statements,   either  because  of  the
significance  of the financial  statement item to which they relate,  or because
they  require  judgment  and  estimation  due to  the  uncertainty  involved  in
measuring, at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature.

o    Cost of goods sold - Cost of goods sold includes warehouse and distribution
     expenses and estimates of amounts due from vendors for certain  merchandise
     allowances  and rebates.  These  estimates are consistent  with  historical
     experience.

o    Operating, selling, general and administrative expense (OSG&A) - Operating,
     selling, general and administrative expense includes estimates for medical,
     workers'  compensation and other general liability  insurance  obligations,
     which  are  partially  based  on  estimates  of  certain  claim  costs  and
     historical experience.

o    Accounts receivable - Allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on
     historical  loss  ratios  and  consistently  has been  within  management's
     expectations.

o    Revenue -  Over-the-counter  retail  sales are  recorded  when the customer
     takes  possession of merchandise.  Sales to professional  installers,  also
     referred  to  as  "commercial   sales",   are  recorded  upon  delivery  of
     merchandise to the customer, generally at the customer's place of business.
     Wholesale sales to other retailers,  also referred to as "jobber sales" are
     recorded  upon  shipment  of  merchandise.  All sales are  recorded  net of
     estimated allowances and discounts.

o    Vendor  concessions  ' The Company  receives  concessions  from its vendors
     through a variety of  programs  and  arrangements,  including  co-operative
     advertising,   allowances  for  warranties  and  volume  purchase  rebates.
     Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising
     program,  specific to a product or event and  identifiable  for  accounting
     purposes are reported as a reduction of  advertising  expense in the period
     in which  the  advertising  occurred.  All  other  vendor  concessions  are
     recognized  as a  reduction  of  cost  of  sales  when  recognized  in  the
     consolidated statement of income.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES (CONTINUED)

o    Stock-based  compensation  - We have  elected  to use the  intrinsic  value
     method of accounting  for stock options issued under our stock option plans
     and  accordingly  do not record an  expense  for such  stock  options.  For
     purposes  of pro  forma  disclosures  under  the  fair  value  method,  the
     estimated  fair value of the  options  is  amortized  to  expense  over the
     options'  vesting  period.  During the fourth  quarter of 2004, the Company
     changed its method of applying  its LIFO  accounting  policy for  inventory
     costs (see Note 2 - Accounting  Changes).  Our stock compensation pro forma
     information for the years ended December 31, is as follows,  both excluding
     and including the effects of the inventory accounting change:

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

2004 COMPARED TO 2003

     Product sales increased $209.4 million, or 13.9% from $1.51 billion in 2003
to $1.72  billion in 2004,  primarily  due to 140 net  additional  stores opened
during 2004, and a 6.8% increase in same-store  product sales for stores open at
least one year.  We believe that the  increased  product  sales  achieved by the
existing  stores  are the  result  of our  offering  of a broader  selection  of
products in most stores, an increased promotional and advertising effort through
a variety of media and localized  promotional events, and continued  improvement
in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores. Also, our continued focus
on serving professional installers contributed to increased product sales.

     Gross profit  increased  16.4% from $638.3 million (42.2% of product sales)
in 2003 to $743.2 million (43.2% of product sales) in 2004. Gross profit dollars
rose $100.4 million due to the increase in product sales and $4.4 million due to
a change in  accounting  method.  The  increase in gross  profit as a percent of
product sales is related to improvements in our  distribution  cost and improved
product margin related to product acquisition cost.

     OSG&A  increased $79.6 million from $473.1 million (31.3% of product sales)
in 2003 to $552.7  million  (32.1% of product  sales) in 2004.  The  increase in
these expenses was primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits,
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations.

     Corrections of errors related to lease accounting represented $10.4 million
($3.5 million  related to 2004) of the  increase.  Rent expense  increased  $4.4
million  ($0.9  million  related  to 2004),  as a result of  corrections  in the
Company's  method  of  calculating  straight-line  rent  expense.   Depreciation
increased  $6.0  million  ($2.6  million  related  to  2004),  as  a  result  of
corrections  in the Company's  method of calculating  amortization  of leasehold
improvements.  The Company's policy is to amortize  leasehold  improvements over
the lesser of the lease term or the  estimated  economic  life of those  assets.
Generally, for stores the lease term is the base lease term and for distribution
centers the lease term includes the base lease term plus certain  renewal option
periods for which  renewal is  reasonably  assured  and failure to exercise  the
renewal  option  would  result  in an  economic  penalty.  The  calculation  for
straight-line  rent  expense  is  based  on the  same  lease  term.  Previously,
leasehold  improvements were amortized over a period of time which included both
the base lease term and the first  renewal  option  period of the lease and rent
expense was recorded as paid.

     Other expense,  net, decreased by $2.5 million from $5.2 million in 2003 to
$2.7 million in 2004.  The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest
expense as a result of lower average borrowings under our credit facility.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $60.0  million in 2003 (37.5%
effective  tax rate) to $70.1 million in 2004 (37.3%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes.

     The  cumulative  change in accounting  method,  effective  January 1, 2004,
changed the method of applying our LIFO accounting  policy for certain inventory
costs. Under the new method, we inventoried certain procurement, warehousing and
distribution  center costs.  The previous method was to recognize those costs as
incurred,  reported  as a component  of costs of goods sold.  We believe the new
method is preferable,  since it better matches  revenues and expenses and is the
prevalent  method  used by other  entities  within  the  automotive  aftermarket
industry.

     Net income in 2004 was $139.6 million (8.1% of product sales),  an increase
of $39.5  million or 39.4%,  from net income in 2003 of $100.1  million (6.6% of
product sales).

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

2003 COMPARED TO 2002

     Product sales increased $199.3 million, or 15.2% from $1.31 billion in 2002
to $1.51  billion in 2003,  primarily  due to 128 net  additional  stores opened
during 2003, and a 7.8% increase in same-store  product sales for stores open at
least one year.  We believe that the  increased  product  sales  achieved by the
existing  stores  are the  result  of our  offering  of a broader  selection  of
products in most stores, an increased promotional and advertising effort through
a variety of media and localized  promotional events, and continued  improvement
in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores. Also, our continued focus
on serving professional installers contributed to increased product sales.

     Gross profit  increased  15.4% from $553.4 million (42.2% of product sales)
in 2002 to $638.3  million  (42.2% of product  sales) in 2003.  The  increase in
gross profit dollars is due to the increase in product sales.

     OSG&A  increased $58.0 million from $415.1 million (31.6% of product sales)
in 2002 to $473.1  million  (31.3% of product  sales) in 2003.  The  increase in
these expenses was primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits,
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations. The decrease in OSG&A expenses as
a percent of product sales was primarily due to achieving  greater  economies of
scale resulting from increased  product sales and through  management's  expense
control initiatives.

     Other expense,  net, decreased by $2.1 million from $7.3 million in 2002 to
$5.2 million in 2003.  The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest
expense as a result of lower average borrowings under our credit facility and to
a lesser extent lower average interest rates.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $49.0  million in 2002 (37.4%
effective  tax rate) to $60.0 million in 2003 (37.5%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes.

     Net income in 2003 was $100.1 million (6.6% of product sales),  an increase
of $18.1  million or 22.1%,  from net income in 2002 of $82.0  million  (6.3% of
product sales).

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Net cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was $226.5  million in 2004,
$168.8 million in 2003 and $104.5 million in 2002. The increase in cash provided
by operating  activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to increases
in net income and accounts payable, partially offset by increases in receivables
and  inventory.   The  increase  in  accounts   payable  was  primarily  due  to
management's  efforts with vendors to extend the terms of payment. The increases
in accounts  receivable and inventory primarily relate to the increased level of
our operations.

     The increase in cash  provided by operating  activities in 2003 compared to
2002 was  primarily  due to increases  in net income and accounts  payable and a
smaller  increase in  inventory  than the prior year.  The  increase in accounts
payable was  primarily  due to  management's  efforts with vendors to extend the
terms of payment.  Inventory growth was reduced by transition of certain product
lines to vendor consignment programs.

     Net cash used in investing  activities was $172.0  million in 2004,  $130.6
million  in 2003 and  $105.4  million  in 2002.  The  increase  in cash  used in
investing  activities in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to increased  purchases
of property and equipment.

     Capital  expenditures  were $173.5 million in 2004,  $136.5 million in 2003
and $102.3 million in 2002.  These  expenditures  were primarily  related to the
opening of new  stores,  as well as the  relocation  or  remodeling  of existing
stores.  We either opened or acquired 140, 128 and 106 net stores in 2004,  2003
and 2002,  respectively.  We remodeled or relocated 30 stores and  remodeled one
distribution  center  in  2004,   remodeled  or  relocated  46  stores  and  two
distribution  centers in 2003 and 27 stores in 2002. One new distribution center
was acquired in 2003, located near Mobile, Alabama.

     Our  continuing  store  expansion  program  requires   significant  capital
expenditures  and working capital  principally for inventory  requirements.  Our
2005 growth plans call for approximately 160 new stores and capital expenditures
of $175 million to $185 million.  The costs associated with the opening of a new
store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, inventory
and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately  $900,000 to $1.1
million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather
than purchase,  the store site.  Although the cost to acquire the business of an
independently  owned parts store varies,  depending primarily upon the amount of
inventory  and the amount,  if any, of real estate being  acquired,  we estimate
that the average  cost to acquire  such a business  and convert it to one of our
stores is  approximately  $400,000.  We plan to finance  our  expansion  program
through cash expected to be provided  from  operating  activities  and available
borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued)

     On July 29, 2002, we completed an unsecured,  three-year  syndicated credit
facility (Credit Facility) in the amount of $150 million led by Wells Fargo Bank
as the Administrative  Agent,  replacing a five-year syndicated credit facility.
The  Credit  Facility  is  guaranteed  by  all of our  subsidiaries  and  may be
increased  to a total  of $200  million,  subject  to the  availability  of such
additional credit from either existing banks within the Credit Facility or other
banks.  At  December  31,  2004 we had no  outstanding  balance  with the Credit
Facility. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from
0.875% to 1.375%  (2.06% at  December  31,  2003) and  expires in July 2005.  At
December  31,  2003,  $20.0  million of the  Credit  Facility  was  outstanding.
Additionally,  letters of credit  totaling  $21.3 million and $11.0 million were
outstanding  at  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Accordingly,  our
aggregate  availability for additional  borrowings under the Credit Facility was
$128.7 million and $119.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

     We have utilized various financial instruments from time to time as sources
of cash when such  instruments  provided  a cost  effective  alternative  to our
existing sources of cash. We do not believe,  however,  that we are dependent on
the availability of these  instruments to fund our working capital  requirements
or our growth plans.

     On December 29, 2000, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction.  Under the
terms of the transaction,  we sold 90 properties,  including land, buildings and
improvements, which generated $52.3 million of additional cash. The lease, which
is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term
of 21  years  and  may be  extended  for one  initial  ten-year  period  and two
additional  successive  periods of five years each.  The resulting  gain of $4.5
million has been  deferred and is being  amortized  over the initial lease term.
Net rent  expense  during the initial  term will be  approximately  $5.5 million
annually  and  is  included  in  the  table  of  contractual  obligations  under
non-cancelable operating leases.

     In August 2001, we completed a sale-leaseback with O'Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC
(an entity  owned by  certain  shareholders  of the  Company).  The  transaction
involved the sale and  leaseback of nine O'Reilly Auto Parts stores and resulted
in approximately $5.6 million of additional cash to the Company. The transaction
did not result in a material gain or loss.  The lease,  which has been accounted
for as an  operating  lease,  calls for an  initial  term of 15 years with three
five-year renewal options.

     On June 26, 2003, we completed an amended and restated master  agreement to
our  $50  million  Synthetic  Operating  Lease  Facility  (the  Facility  or the
Synthetic  Lease)  with a group  of  financial  institutions.  The  terms of the
Facility  provide for an initial  lease period of five years,  a residual  value
guarantee of  approximately  $43.2  million at December  31, 2004,  and purchase
options on the  properties.  The Facility also contains a provision for an event
of default  whereby the lessor,  among other things,  may require us to purchase
any or all of the properties. One additional renewal period of five years may be
requested  from the lessor,  although the lessor is not  obligated to grant such
renewal.  The Facility has been  accounted  for as an operating  lease under the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 13 and related  interpretations,  including FASB
Interpretation No. 46. Future minimum rental commitments under the Facility have
been included in the table of contractual obligations below.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     We issue  stand-by  letters of credit  provided by a $30  million  sublimit
under the Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings. These letters of
credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation,
general  liability  and  other  insurance  policies.  Substantially  all  of the
outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance and
have been issued to replace surety bonds that were previously issued. Letters of
credit totaling $21.3 million and $11.0 million were outstanding at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

     We  have  other  liabilities  reflected  in our  balance  sheet,  including
deferred  income  taxes and  self-insurance  accruals.  The payment  obligations
associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the financial commitments
table due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these
payments  cannot be  determined,  except for amounts  estimated to be payable in
2005 that are included in current liabilities.

     Our  contractual  obligations,  including  commitments  for future payments
under   non-cancelable   lease   arrangements   and  short  and  long-term  debt
arrangements,  are summarized  below and are fully disclosed in Notes 4 and 5 to
the consolidated financial statements.


     We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash expected to be
provided by operating  activities,  available  bank credit  facilities and trade
credit will be sufficient  to fund both our  short-term  and  long-term  capital
needs for the foreseeable future.

INFLATION AND SEASONALITY

     We  attempt  to  mitigate  the  effects  of   merchandise   cost  increases
principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale
resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective  forward buying. As a
result,  we do not believe that our operations have been materially  affected by
inflation.  Our  business is  somewhat  seasonal,  primarily  as a result of the
impact of weather  conditions  on store  sales.  Store  sales and  profits  have
historically  been  higher in the  second  and  third  quarters  (April  through
September) of each year than in the first and fourth quarters.

RESTATEMENT OF QUARTERLY RESULTS

     The following table sets forth certain quarterly  unaudited  operating data
for fiscal 2004 and 2003.  The  unaudited  quarterly  information  includes  all
adjustments which management  considers necessary for a fair presentation of the
information shown. We have restated our quarterly financial information for each
of the first three  quarters  of 2004.  Effective  January 1, 2004,  the Company
changed its method of applying its LIFO accounting  policy for inventory  costs.
Under the new method,  the  Company  has  inventoried  certain  warehousing  and
distribution center costs. The Company's previous method recorded these expenses
directly into cost of goods sold. The Company believes the change in application
of accounting  method is preferable as it more accurately  matches  revenues and
expenses and is the prevelant method used by other entities within the Company's
industry.  The  cumulative  effect of this change in  application  of accounting
method is  $21,892,000  as of January 1, 2004,  net of the related  deferred tax
effect of $13,303,000.

     The unaudited  operating data presented below should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated  financial statements and related notes included elsewhere
in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In November 2004, the FASB issued  SFAS 151,  Inventory Costs, an amendment
of ARB No. 43,  Chapter 4.  The standard  requires that abnormal amounts of idle
capacity and spoilage  costs should be excluded  from the cost of inventory  and
expensed when incurred.  The provision is effective for fiscal periods beginning
after  June 15,  2005.  We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     In  December  2004,  the FASB issued  SFAS 153,  Exchanges  of  Nonmonetary
Assets,  an amendment of APB No. 29,  Accounting for  Nonmonetary  Transactions.
SFAS 153  requires  exchanges of  productive  assets to be accounted for at fair
value, rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset received nor
the asset  surrendered has a fair value that is determinable  within  reasonable
limits or (2) the transactions lack commercial substance.  SFAS 153 is effective
for  nonmonetary  asset  exchanges  occurring in fiscal periods  beginning after
June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (continued)


     In December 2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS
No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,
and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB 25
and the  intrinsic  value  method  of  accounting,  and  requires  companies  to
recognize  the cost of employee  services  received  in  exchange  for awards of
equity  instruments,  based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the
financial  statements.  The effective  date of SFAS 123R is the first  reporting
period  beginning after June 15,  2005, which is third quarter 2005 for calendar
year companies, such as ourselves, although early adoption is allowed. SFAS 123R
permits   companies  to  adopt  its   requirements   using  either  a  "modified
prospective" method, or a "modified  retrospective"  method. Under the "modified
prospective" method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements
beginning with the effective  date,  based on the  requirements of SFAS 123R for
all share-based  payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements
of SFAS 123 for all unvested  awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS
123R. Under the "modified  retrospective"  method, the requirements are the same
as under the "modified prospective" method, but also permits entities to restate
financial  statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in
accordance  with SFAS 123. We currently  utilize a standard option pricing model
(i.e.,  Black-Scholes)  to measure  the fair value of stock  options  granted to
employees. While SFAS 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the
standard also permits the use of a "lattice"  model.  We have not yet determined
which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon
the adoption of SFAS 123R.  See Note 8 for further  information.  SFAS 123R also
requires  that the  benefits  associated  with the tax  deductions  in excess of
recognized  compensation  cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than
as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement
will reduce net operating  cash flows and increase net  financing  cash flows in
periods  after the effective  date.  These future  amounts  cannot be estimated,
because  they depend on,  among other  things,  when  employees  exercise  stock
options. However, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods
for such excess tax deductions,  as shown in our Consolidated  Statement of Cash
Flows, were $4.5 million,  $5.5 million,  and $1.5 million,  for the years ended
December 31, 2004,  2003, and 2002,  respectively.  We currently expect to adopt
SFAS 123R effective July 1,  2005;  however, we have not yet determined which of
the  aforementioned  adoption  methods we will use and are still  evaluating the
standard.  See Note 8 for further  information on our  stock-based  compensation
plans.

        MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. and Subsidiaries  (the Company) is
responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  adequate  internal  control over
financial  reporting.  Our  internal  control  system  is  designed  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Internal control over financial  reporting  includes all policies and procedures
that:

o    pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,
     accurately  and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the
     assets of the Company;

o    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
     permit  preparation  of financial  statements in accordance  with GAAP, and
     that  receipts  and  expenditures  of the  Company  are being  made only in
     accordance with  authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
     and

o    provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of
     unauthorized  acquisition,  use or disposition of the Company's assets that
     could have a material effect on the financial statements.

All  internal  control  systems,  no matter  how well  designed,  have  inherent
limitations.  Therefore,  even those  systems  determined  to be  effective  can
provide  only   reasonable   assurance  with  respect  to  financial   statement
preparation   and   presentation.   Also,   projections  of  any  evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk. Over time, controls may
become  inadequate  because of changes in  conditions  or  deterioration  in the
degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Under the supervision and with the  participation  of our management,  including
our principal Executive Officer and our principal Financial Officer, we assessed
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial  reporting as
of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment,  we used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway  Commission (COSO)
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.  Based on our assessment, we believe
that as of December 31, 2004,  the  Company's  internal  control over  financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP,  Independent  Registered Public Accounting Firm, that audited
the Company's consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report
on  management's  assessment of the Company's  internal  control over  financial
reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of  Directors  and  Shareholders  of  O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc.  and
Subsidiaries

We  have  audited   management's   assessment,   included  in  the  accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,  that O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc. and Subsidiaries  maintained  effective  internal control over
financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004,  based on criteria  established in
Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued by the  Committee of  Sponsoring
Organizations  of  the  Treadway   Commission  (the  COSO  criteria).   O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries'  management is responsible  for maintaining
effective  internal  control over financial  reporting and for its assessment of
the   effectiveness   of  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.   Our
responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on  management's  assessment  and an
opinion on the  effectiveness  of the company's  internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted  our audit in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting,  evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other  procedures as we considered  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,  management's  assessment  that  O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. and
Subsidiaries  maintained  effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on the
COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, O'Reilly Automotive,  Inc. and Subsidiaries
maintained, in all material respects,  effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the consolidated balance sheets of
O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders'  equity, and cash
flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2004 of
O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries and our report dated March 7, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Business

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc.  (the  Company)  is a  specialty  retailer  and
supplier of automotive  aftermarket  parts,  tools,  supplies and accessories to
both the do-it-yourself (DIY) customer and the professional installer throughout
Alabama, Arkansas,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Nebraska,  North Carolina,  Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned  subsidiaries.  All significant  intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

     Over-the-counter   retail  sales  are  recorded  when  the  customer  takes
possession of merchandise. Sales to professional installers, also referred to as
"commercial  sales",  are recorded upon delivery of merchandise to the customer,
generally  at the  customer's  place  of  business.  Wholesale  sales  to  other
retailers,  also  referred to as "jobber  sales," are recorded  upon shipment of
merchandise. All sales are recorded net of estimated allowances and discounts.

Use of Estimates

     The preparation of the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in conformity
with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States  (GAAP),
requires  management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Inventory

     Inventory,  which  consists of automotive  hard parts,  maintenance  items,
accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventory also
includes related  procurement,  warehousing and distribution  center costs. Cost
has been determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. If the first-in,
first-out  (FIFO)  method of  costing  inventory  had been used by the  Company,
inventory would have been  $628,309,000 and $513,365,000 as of December 31, 2004
and  2003,  respectively.  Please  refer  to  Note 2 for  cumulative  effect  of
accounting change.

  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Amounts Receivable from Vendors

     The Company  receives  concessions  from its  vendors  through a variety of
programs  and  arrangements,  including  co-operative  advertising,  devaluation
programs,  allowances for warranties and volume purchase  rebates.  Co-operative
advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific
to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a
reduction  of  advertising  expense  in the  period  in  which  the  advertising
occurred.  All other vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction of cost of
sales when recognized in the consolidated  income statement.  Amounts receivable
from vendors also includes amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise
and product returns.  Reserves for uncollectable amounts receivable from vendors
are  provided  for  in  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  and
consistently have been within management's expectations.

Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are carried at cost.  Depreciation  is provided on a
straight-line  method over the  estimated  useful  lives of the assets.  Service
lives for  property  and  equipment  generally  range from three to forty years.
Leasehold  improvements  are amortized  over the lesser of the lease term or the
estimated  economic life of the assets.  The lease term includes renewal options
determined by  management at lease  inception for which failure to renew options
would result in a substantial  economic penalty to the Company.  Maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Upon  retirement or sale,  the cost
and  accumulated  depreciation  are  eliminated and the gain or loss, if any, is
included  in the  determination  of net income as a  component  of other  income
(expense).  The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable.

     The Company  capitalizes  interest costs as a component of  construction in
progress,  based on the  weighted-average  rates paid for long-term  borrowings.
Total interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, were $2,579,000, $1,808,000 and $369,000, respectively.

Income Taxes

     The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using the  liability  method in
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109. The
liability   method  provides  that  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are
determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and  liabilities  and are  measured  using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Advertising Costs

     The Company expenses  advertising  costs as incurred.  Advertising  expense
charged to operations  amounted to $22,999,000,  $19,533,000 and $14,442,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Pre-opening Costs

     Costs associated with the opening of new stores, which consist primarily of
payroll and occupancy costs, are charged to operations as incurred.

Stock Option Plans

     The Company has elected to follow  Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No.
25,   Accounting   for  Stock  Issued  to   Employees   (APB  25),  and  related
interpretations  in  accounting  for its  employee  stock  options  because,  as
discussed in Note 8, the alternative  fair value  accounting  provided for under
SFAS No. 123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  requires  the use of
option  valuation  models that were not  developed  for use in valuing  employee
stock  options.  SFAS  No.  148,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based   Compensation  -
Transition  and  Disclosure,   further  established  accounting  and  disclosure
requirements  using a  fair-value-based  method of  accounting  for  stock-based
employee compensation plans. Under the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB 25,  because the exercise  price of the Company's  stock options  equals the
market  price of the  underlying  stock on the date of  grant,  no  compensation
expense is recognized.

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Stock Option Plans (continued)

     For  purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the  options'  vesting  period.  During the
fourth  quarter of 2004,  the Company  changed  its method of applying  its LIFO
accounting  policy for inventory  costs (see Note 2 - Accounting  Changes).  Our
stock  compensation pro forma information for the years ended December 31, is as
follows,  both  excluding and including the effects of the inventory  accounting
change:

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Earnings per Share

     Basic  earnings  per  share is based  on the  weighted-average  outstanding
common  shares.  Diluted  earnings  per  share is based on the  weighted-average
outstanding shares adjusted for the effect of common stock  equivalents.  Common
stock equivalents that could potentially  dilute basic earnings per share in the
future that were not  included in the fully  diluted  computation  because  they
would have been  antidilutive  were  272,000,  66,750 and  816,250 for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

 Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents  consist of investments with maturities of 90 days or less
at the day of purchase.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     Financial   instruments   that   potentially   subject   the   Company   to
concentrations  of credit risk  consist  primarily  of cash,  cash  equivalents,
accounts receivable and notes receivable.

     The  Company  grants  credit to certain  customers  who meet the  Company's
pre-established credit requirements.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to these receivables are limited because the Company's customer base consists of
a large number of smaller customers, thus spreading the credit risk. The Company
controls  credit risk through  credit  approvals,  credit limits and  monitoring
procedures.  Generally  the  Company  does not require  security  when credit is
granted  to  customers.   Credit  losses  are  provided  for  in  the  Company's
consolidated financial statements and consistently have been within management's
expectations.

     The carrying value of the Company's financial  instruments,  including cash
and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt,
as reported in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets,  approximates fair
value.

Notes Receivable

     The  Company had notes  receivable  from  vendors  and other third  parties
amounting  to  $25,108,000  and  $27,742,000  at  December  31,  2004 and  2003,
respectively. The notes receivable, which bear interest at rates ranging from 0%
to 10%, are due in varying amounts through August 2017.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In November 2004, the FASB issued  SFAS 151,  Inventory Costs, an amendment
of ARB No. 43,  Chapter 4.  The standard  requires that abnormal amounts of idle
capacity and spoilage  costs should be excluded  from the cost of inventory  and
expensed when incurred.  The provision is effective for fiscal periods beginning
after  June 15,  2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard
to have a material  effect on its financial  position,  results of operations or
cash flows.

     In  December  2004,  the FASB issued  SFAS 153,  Exchanges  of  Nonmonetary
Assets,  an amendment of APB No. 29,  Accounting for  Nonmonetary  Transactions.
SFAS 153  requires  exchanges of  productive  assets to be accounted for at fair
value, rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset received nor
the asset  surrendered has a fair value that is determinable  within  reasonable
limits or (2) the transactions lack commercial substance.  SFAS 153 is effective
for  nonmonetary  asset  exchanges  occurring in fiscal periods  beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have
a material  effect on its  financial  position,  results of  operations  or cash
flows.

     In December 2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS
No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,
and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB 25
and the  intrinsic  value  method  of  accounting,  and  requires  companies  to
recognize  the cost of employee  services  received  in  exchange  for awards of
equity  instruments,  based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the
financial  statements.  The effective  date of SFAS 123R is the first  reporting
period  beginning after June 15,  2005, which is third quarter 2005 for calendar
year companies,  although early adoption is allowed. SFAS 123R permits companies
to adopt its requirements  using either a "modified  prospective"  method,  or a
"modified  retrospective"  method.  Under  the  "modified  prospective"  method,
compensation cost is recognized in the financial  statements  beginning with the
effective  date,  based on the  requirements  of SFAS  123R for all  share-based
payments  granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for
all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R.  Under the
"modified  retrospective"  method,  the  requirements  are the same as under the
"modified  prospective"  method,  but also permits entities to restate financial
statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance
with SFAS 123. The Company  currently  utilizes a standard  option pricing model
(i.e.,  Black-Scholes)  to measure  the fair value of stock  options  granted to
employees. While SFAS 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the
standard  also  permits  the use of a "lattice"  model.  The Company has not yet
determined  which model it will use to measure the fair value of employee  stock
options upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 8 for further information. SFAS
123R also  requires  that the benefits  associated  with the tax  deductions  in
excess of  recognized  compensation  cost be reported as a financing  cash flow,
rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash
flows in periods  after the  effective  date.  These  future  amounts  cannot be
estimated,  because they depend on, among other things,  when employees exercise
stock options.  However,  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior
periods for such excess tax deductions,  as shown in the Company's  Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows, were $4.5 million,  $5.5 million, and $1.5 million, for
the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003, and 2002,  respectively.  The Company
currently  expects to adopt  SFAS 123R  effective  July 1,  2005;  however,  the
Company has not yet determined which of the  aforementioned  adoption methods it
will use and is still evaluating the standard.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Reclassifications

     The Company made certain  reclassifications  to prior periods to conform to
current year presentation.

Leases

     The Company's policy is to amortize leasehold  improvements over the lesser
of the lease term or the estimated economic life of those assets. Generally, for
stores the lease term is the base lease term and for  distribution  centers  the
lease term includes the base lease term plus certain  renewal option periods for
which renewal is reasonably  assured and failure to exercise the renewal  option
would result in an economic  penalty.  The  calculation for  straight-line  rent
expense is based on the same lease term. Previously, leasehold improvements were
amortized  over a period of time which included both the base lease term and the
first renewal option period of the lease and rent expense was recorded as paid.

     As a result,  the Company's 2004 statement of income includes an adjustment
to correct its lease accounting of $10.4 million ($3.5 million related to 2004),
$6.5 million, net of tax. Prior years' financial statements will not be restated
due to the  immateriality  of  the  amount  to the  results  of  operations  and
statement of financial  position for the current year or any individual year. As
the correction  relates solely to accounting  treatment,  it does not affect the
Company's historical or future cash flows.

     The effect from these  corrections,  which is  reflected  in the  financial
statements, is an increase in depreciation expense of $6.0 million ($2.6 million
related to 2004),  an increase in rent  expense of $4.4  million  ($0.9  million
related to 2004), and a decrease in income tax expense of $3.9 million.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 2 - ACCOUNTING CHANGES

     The  Company's  inventory  consists of automotive  hard parts,  maintenance
items,  accessories  and tools.  During the fourth  quarter of 2004, the Company
changed its method of applying its LIFO accounting  policy for inventory  costs.
Under  the  new  method,  the  Company  has  inventoried  certain   procurement,
warehousing and distribution  center costs. The Company's previous method was to
recognize  those costs as  incurred,  reported as a component  of costs of goods
sold.  The Company  believes the change in  application  of the LIFO  accounting
method is  preferable  as it better  matches  revenues  and  expenses and is the
prevalent  method used by other  entities  within the  Company's  industry.  The
cumulative  effect  of this  change  in  application  of  accounting  method  is
$21,892,000  as of January 1, 2004,  net of the related  deferred  tax effect of
$13,303,000.  The change  increased  2004 net income by  $2,722,000 or $0.05 per
share. Prior 2004 quarterly  financial  statements have been restated to reflect
this change, effective January 1, 2004, (see Restatement of Quarterly Results in
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations). Pro forma changes to results of operations as if the new method had
been applied for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are presented below.



NOTE 3-RELATED PARTIES

     The  Company  leases  certain  land and  buildings  related to fifty of its
O'Reilly  Auto Parts stores  under  six-year  operating  lease  agreements  with
O'Reilly  Investment  Company and O'Reilly Real Estate Company,  partnerships in
which certain shareholders and directors of the Company are partners. Generally,
these lease  agreements  provide for renewal options for an additional six years
at the option of the Company. Additionally, the Company leases certain

  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 3-RELATED PARTIES (CONTINUED)

land and buildings related to twenty-one of its O'Reilly Auto Parts stores under
15-year operating lease agreements with O'Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC, which is owned
by certain  shareholders  of the  Company.  Generally,  these  lease  agreements
provide for renewal options for two additional  five-year terms at the option of
the Company (see Note 5). Rent payments  under these  operating  leases  totaled
$3,374,000, $3,238,000 and $3,222,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 4-LONG-TERM DEBT

     On July 29, 2002, the Company amended the unsecured,  three-year syndicated
credit  facility  (Credit  Facility)  in the amount of $150 million led by Wells
Fargo Bank as the Administrative Agent,  replacing a five-year syndicated credit
facility. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of the Company's subsidiaries
and may be increased to a total of $200 million,  subject to the availability of
such additional  credit from either existing banks within the Credit Facility or
other banks.  At December 31, 2004 the Company had no  outstanding  balance with
the Credit  Facility.  The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread
ranging  from 0.875% to 1.375%  (2.06% at December 31, 2003) and expires in July
2005.  At  December  31,  2003,   $20.0  million  of  the  Credit  Facility  was
outstanding.  Accordingly,  the Company's aggregate  availability for additional
borrowings  under the Credit  Facility was $128.7  million and $119.0 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     The Company  issues  stand-by  letters of credit  provided by a $30 million
sublimit  under the Credit  Facility  that reduce  available  borrowings.  These
letters of credit are issued  primarily to satisfy the  requirements  of workers
compensation,  general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all
of the  outstanding  letters  of credit  have a  one-year  term from the date of
issuance  and have been  issued to replace  surety  bonds  that were  previously
issued.  Letters  of  credit  totaling  $21.3  million  and $11.0  million  were
outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     On May 16, 2001, the Company  completed a $100 million private placement of
two series of unsecured  senior notes (Senior  Notes).  The Series 2001-A Senior
Notes were issued for $75 million,  are due May 16, 2006,  and bear  interest at
7.72% per year. The Series 2001-B Senior Notes were issued for $25 million,  are
due May 16, 2008,  and bear  interest at 7.92% per year.  The private  placement
agreement allows for a total of $200 million of Senior Notes issuable in series.
Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce  outstanding  borrowings under
the Company's former revolving credit facility.

     The Company leases certain  computer  equipment under a capitalized  lease.
The lease  agreement has a term of 30 months,  expiring in 2006. At December 31,
2004, the monthly  installment under this agreement was  approximately  $48,500.
The present value of the future minimum lease  payments  under these  agreements
totaled  $858,000 and $1,426,300 at December 31, 2004,  and 2003,  respectively,
which has been  classified as long-term  debt in the  accompanying  consolidated
financial statements. During 2004, the Company did not purchase any assets under
a capitalized  lease.  During 2003, the Company  purchased  $1,426,300 of assets
under a capitalized lease.

respectively.

NOTE 5-COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

     On June 26, 2003, we completed an amended and restated master  agreement to
our  $50  million  Synthetic  Operating  Lease  Facility  (the  Facility  or the
Synthetic  Lease)  with a group  of  financial  institutions.  The  terms of the
Facility  provide for an initial  lease period of five years,  a residual  value
guarantee of  approximately  $43.2  million at December  31, 2004,  and purchase
options on the  properties.  The Facility also contains a provision for an event
of default  whereby the lessor,  among other things,  may require us to purchase
any or all of the properties. One additional renewal period of five years may be
requested  from the lessor,  although the lessor is not  obligated to grant such
renewal.  The  amended  and  restated  Facility  has  been  accounted  for as an
operating  lease under SFAS No. 13 and related  interpretations,  including FASB
Interpretation No. 46. Future minimum rental commitments under the Facility have
been included in the table of future minimum annual rental commitments below.

NOTE 5-COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

     The Company also leases certain office space,  retail stores,  property and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases. Most of these leases
include  renewal options and some include options to purchase and provisions for
percentage  rent based on sales.  At December 31, 2004,  future  minimum  rental
payments under all of the Company's  operating  leases for each of the next five
years and in the aggregate are as follows (amounts in thousands):



     Rental expense amounted to $39,145,000, $31,865,000 and $29,652,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 2004 rental expense
includes an adjustment  to correct lease  accounting in the amount of $4,367,000
($900,000 related to 2004.) See Note 1 - Leases for further details.

Other Commitments

     The Company had construction commitments, which totaled approximately $32.3
million, at December 31, 2004.

NOTE 6-LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is  involved in various  legal  proceedings  incidental  to the
conduct of its  business.  Although the Company  cannot  ascertain the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters,  it does not  currently
believe that, in the aggregate,  they will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated  financial  position,  results of  operations  or cash flows of the
Company.

NOTE 7-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company  sponsors a  contributory  profit sharing and savings plan that
covers  substantially  all  employees  who are 21 years of age with at least six
months of service. A total of 1,600,000 shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance  under the plan.  Employees  may  contribute up to 100% of their annual
compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum  limitations.  The Company
has agreed to make matching  contributions  equal to 50% of the first 2% of each
employee's contribution and 25% of the next 4% of each employee's  contribution.
Additional  contributions to the plan may be made as determined  annually by the
Board of  Directors.  After  two years of  service,  Company  contributions  and
earnings thereon vest at the rate of 20% per year. Company contributions charged
to operations amounted to $5,278,000 in 2004,  $4,353,000 in 2003 and $3,438,000
in 2002.  Company  contributions,  in the form of common  stock,  to the  profit
sharing and savings plan to match employee  contributions during the years ended
December 31 were as follows:



     Profit sharing contributions accrued at December 31, and funded in the next
year  through  the  issuance  of shares of the  Company's  common  stock were as
follows:

NOTE 7-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)

     Additionally,  the Company has  adopted a stock  purchase  plan under which
1,300,000  shares of common stock were  reserved for  issuance.  Under the plan,
substantially  all  employees  and  non-employee  directors  have  the  right to
purchase shares of the Company's common stock monthly at a price equal to 85% of
the fair market value of the stock, not to exceed 5% of the participants  annual
salary. Purchases of common stock under the plan during the years ended December
31 were as follows:



     The Company has in effect a  performance  incentive  plan for the Company's
senior  management  under  which  400,000  shares  of stock  were  reserved  for
issuance.  Shares  awarded under the plan vest equally over a three-year  period
and are held in escrow until such  vesting has  occurred.  Shares are  forfeited
when an employee ceases employment. Shares, net of forfeitures, issued under the
plan during the years ended December 31 were as follows:



NOTE 8-SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shareholder Rights Plan

     On May 17, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan.
One Right was  distributed  for each share of common  stock,  par value $.01 per
share, of the Company held by stockholders of record as of the close of business
on May  31,  2002.  The  Rights  initially  entitle  stockholders  to buy a unit
representing one  one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock of
the Company for $160 and expire on May 30, 2012.  The Rights  generally  will be
exercisable  only if a person or group acquires  beneficial  ownership of 15% or
more of the Company's  common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon
consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own 15% or more of
the Company's common stock. If a person or group acquires  beneficial  ownership
of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each Right (other than Rights held
by the  acquiror)  will,  unless the Rights are redeemed by the Company,  become
exercisable  upon payment of the exercise  price of $160 for common stock of the
Company  having a market value of twice the exercise  price of the Right. A copy
of the  Stockholder  Rights Plan was filed on May 28, 2002,  with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, as Exhibit 99.1 to our report on Form 8-K.

Stock Option Plans

     The Company has a stock option plan under which  incentive stock options or
non-qualified  stock  options may be granted to officers and key  employees.  An
aggregate of 12,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance

Stock Option Plans (continued)

under this plan.  The exercise  price of options  granted shall not be less than
the fair  market  value of the stock on the date of grant and the  options  will
expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.  Options granted  pursuant
to the plan become exercisable no sooner than six months from the date of grant.
All grants  under the plan since its  inception  have been  non-qualified  stock
option  grants.  A summary of  outstanding  stock  options under this plan is as
follows:



     Options to purchase  1,612,600,  1,223,409 and  1,566,104  shares of common
stock were exercisable at December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 8-SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)

     The Company also maintains a stock option plan for  non-employee  directors
of the Company  under which  500,000  shares of common  stock were  reserved for
issuance.  All  director  stock  options are granted at fair market value on the
date of grant and expire on the earlier of termination of service to the Company
as a director or seven years. Options granted under this plan become exercisable
six months from the date of grant. A summary of outstanding  stock options under
this plan is as follows:



     All options under this plan were  exercisable  at December 31, 2004,  2003,
and 2002.

     Pro forma  information  regarding  net  income  and  earnings  per share is
required  by SFAS  No.  123,  and has  been  determined  as if the  Company  had
accounted  for its employee and  non-employee  director  stock options under the
fair value method.

     The fair values for these options were estimated at the date of grant using
a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with  the  following  weighted-average
assumptions for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively:  risk-free interest rates of
3.01%,  3.61% and 4.01%;  volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Company's common stock of .404, .458, and .481; and expected life of the options
of 4.0,  9.4 and 9.0 years.  The Company  assumed a 0%  dividend  yield over the
expected  life of the  options.  The  weighted-average  fair  values of  options
granted  during the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003, and 2002 were $14.47,
$20.56 and $17.75, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual life
at December 31, 2004,  for all  outstanding  options under the  Company's  stock
option  plans  is  7.2  years.  The  weighted-average  exercise  price  for  all
outstanding  options under the Company's  stock option plans was $29.88,  $26.11
and $22.78 at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The  Black-Scholes   option  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded options,  which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.   Because  the   Company's   stock   options  have   characteristics
significantly  different from those of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's opinion, the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows at December 31:

has  been  reflected  as  additional   paid-in   capital  in  the   accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

     During the years ended December 31, 2004,  2003, and 2002, cash paid by the
Company for income taxes amounted to $55,140,000,  $43,007,000 and  $31,119,000,
respectively.

             Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of  Directors  and  Shareholders  of  O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc.  and
Subsidiaries

We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December  31, 2004 and 2003,  and the
related consolidated statements of income,  shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the  three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2004.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all  material  respects,   the  consolidated   financial  position  of  O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  at  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  and the
consolidated  results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2004,  in  conformity  with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in 2004 the
Company changed its method of accounting for inventory.

We also have  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  effectiveness  of O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as
of   December   31,   2004,   based  on   criteria   established   in   Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the  Treadway  Commission  and our report  dated March 7, 2005  expressed  an
unqualified opinion thereon.

Mr. James R. Batten
Chief Financial Officer
O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.
233 South Patterson
Springfield, MO 65802

Dear Sir:

Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and
Subsidiaries included in its Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31,
2004  describes a change in the method of accounting for inventory to capitalize
into inventory certain  procurement,  warehousing and distribution  costs, which
were previously  expensed as incurred.  There are no authoritative  criteria for
determining  a  preferable  inventory  costing  method  based on the  particular
circumstances; however, we conclude that such change in the method of accounting
is to an acceptable alternative method which, based on your business judgment to
make  this  change  and  for  the  stated   reasons,   is   preferable  in  your
circumstances.

                                Very truly yours,

                                /s/ Ernst & Young LLP
