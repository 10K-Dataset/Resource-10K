PART I

Item 1.

Business

Introduction

O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively “O’Reilly” or the “Company”, is one of the largest
specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers and professional installers. O’Reilly Automotive, Inc.
was incorporated in 1957 as a corporation. The Company was founded by Charles F. O’Reilly and his son, Charles H. “Chub” O’Reilly, Sr. and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri. The Company’s common
stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ORLY”.

At December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores in 38
states. Our stores carry an extensive product line, including, but not limited to, the products bulleted below (we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations):

•

new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, such as alternators, starters, fuel pumps, water pumps, brake system components, batteries, belts, hoses,
chassis parts and engine parts;

•

maintenance items, such as oil, antifreeze, fluids, filters, wiper blades, lighting, engine additives and appearance products;

•

accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories; and

•

a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service equipment.

On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK, one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western United
States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of CSK common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to
receive 0.4285 of a share of O’Reilly common stock and $1.00 in cash. To fund the transaction, we entered into a Credit Agreement (“ABL Credit Agreement”) for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit
Facility”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A. (“BA”), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward.
The results of CSK’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

At the date of
the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck’s Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray’s Discount Auto Parts. This acquisition added stores in twelve new states: Alaska,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington, and a number of new markets in states where O’Reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition. The integration of CSK is focused on the
implementation of our dual market strategy, the ability to effectively serve both DIY customers and professional installers, which requires conversion of store and distribution information systems, enhancements to the distribution infrastructure,
inventory offerings and infusion of the O’Reilly culture. Conversion of all CSK stores to O’Reilly branded stores began in October of 2008 and will continue into 2011. In order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the
CSK store network, we have added a distribution center in Seattle, Washington, in November of 2009, and Moreno Valley, California, in January of 2010, and will add distribution centers in Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah, in the first half
of 2010. As of December 31, 2009, we had converted 405 CSK stores to O’Reilly systems, merged 41 CSK stores with existing O’Reilly locations, closed 13 CSK stores and opened five new stores in CSK historical markets.

See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 14 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business. These risk factors include, among others,
risks related to our growth strategy, the integration of CSK, increased debt levels, our acquisition strategies, competition in the



automotive aftermarket business, our dependence upon key and other personnel, future growth assurance, our
sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, legal proceedings and related matters arising from CSK, the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the
volatility of the market price of our common stock, our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products, complications in our distribution centers, and environmental legislation and regulations.

Our Business

Our goal is to continue to
achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new
markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and core O’Reilly values of customer service and expense control. Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing significant value to both installer
and DIY customers.

Competitive Advantages

Proven Ability to Execute a Dual Market Strategy.

We have an established track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY customers and professional installers. We believe our ability
to execute a dual market strategy is a competitive advantage. The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, by capitalizing on our existing retail and
distribution infrastructure, by operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, as well as by enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of
a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional installers.

We have been committed to our dual market strategy
for over 30 years. In 2009, core O’Reilly stores derived approximately 53% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 47% from our professional installer customers. As a result of our historical success of executing our dual market
strategy and our over 450 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional installer, we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional installers and will continue to have a competitive advantage
over our retail competitors who derive a high concentration of their sales from the DIY market. In 2009, acquired CSK stores derived approximately 84% of sales from our DIY customers and approximately 16% from our professional installer customers.
We have a tremendous opportunity to build on the strong retail base at the CSK stores by growing the commercial business through the implementation of our dual market strategy and capitalizing on our other competitive advantages.

Superior Customer Service.

We seek to attract new DIY and professional installer customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior
customer service, the key elements of which are bulleted below:

•

superior in-store service through highly-motivated, technically-proficient store personnel (“Professional Parts People”) using an advanced
point-of-sale system;

•

an extensive selection and availability of products;

•

attractive stores in convenient locations; and

•

competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers’ quality and value preferences.

Technically Proficient Professional Parts People.

Our highly proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a
significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts,
in order to better serve the technically oriented professional installers with whom they interact on a daily basis. Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance
provided by our Professional Parts People.

Strategic Distribution Systems.

We believe our commitment to a robust, regional
distribution center network provides for superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. Our inventory management and distribution systems
electronically link each of our stores to a distribution center, providing for efficient inventory control and management. Our distribution system provides each of our stores, excluding the nonconverted CSK stores, with same-day or overnight access
to an average of 118,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), many of which are hard to find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers. Distribution infrastructure enhancements are a key component to the CSK integration plan and
will enable us to support the acquired store network with the same inventory availability provided to our historic O’Reilly markets. We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying
customer demand and generating repeat business.

We currently operate 21 distribution centers, including two acquired in the CSK acquisition
and our newly opened Greensboro, North Carolina; Seattle, Washington; and Moreno Valley, California, distribution centers. In 2010, we will open additional distribution



centers in Denver, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah, to help support the acquired CSK stores in the west.
As these new distribution centers open, the acquired CSK stores in those areas will begin to convert to O’Reilly systems and will begin receiving same-day or overnight access to an average of 118,000 SKUs.

Experienced Management Team.

Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan, including the
identification and integration of strategic acquisitions. We have experienced seventeen consecutive years of record revenues and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993. We have a strong senior
management team comprised of 133 professionals who average 16 years of service. In addition, our 191 corporate managers average 13 years of service and our 311 district managers average 10 years of service.

Growth Strategy

Aggressively
Open New Stores.

We intend to continue to open new stores to achieve greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new, contiguous markets. We plan to open approximately 150 stores in 2010 – a majority of these sites have been
identified. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O’Reilly stores. We typically open new stores either
by (i) constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory, (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory
and other assets (other than realty) of such store, or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains. Store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of
scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, the number and type of existing
automotive repair facilities, other competing auto parts stores, other competitors within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such competitors. When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially
open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.

We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network. While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe that we have competed effectively, and
that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within these markets. We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores
in less densely populated areas within our geographic footprint, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Consequently, we also expect to continue to open new stores in less
densely populated market areas.

Profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. To achieve improved
sales and profitability at existing O’Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket
business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional installer, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions.

Although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, we believe the ability of national retail chains, such as ourselves, to operate
more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation. Thus, our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading
automotive products supplier.

Continually Enhance Store Design and Location.

Our current prototype store design features enhancements
such as optimized square footage, higher ceilings, more convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, brighter lighting, increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional installers, each designed to
increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service. We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance. We
believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.

Grow Professional Installer Relationships in the Western United States.

In order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the CSK
store network and grow our share of the professional installer market in those areas, we opened distribution centers in Seattle, Washington, in November of 2009 and Moreno Valley, California, in January of 2010. We will open two new distribution
centers in Denver, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah, in the first half of 2010. The Seattle, Moreno Valley and Denver distribution centers were existing facilities we purchased and ranged in size from 222,000 to 407,000 square feet. The Salt Lake
City distribution center will be constructed and total approximately 205,000 square feet. After evaluation of the existing CSK Dixon, California, distribution center, we made the decision to relocate this distribution center to a larger facility in
Stockton, California. The Stockton, California, distribution center will be a 520,000 square foot, leased facility that will open in the summer of 2010. These strategically located distribution centers will provide converted CSK stores with same-day
or overnight delivery access to an average



of 118,000 SKUs and will give these stores an important tool to provide industry-leading customer service to
the professional installer, as well as the DIY customer. Our expanded distribution network will provide access to the breadth of SKUs needed to succeed in the professional installer side of the business and will be a very meaningful service
enhancement for our retail customers as well.

Management Structure

Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service
specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of that store. Each of our 311 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 11 stores, which provides our stores with the appropriate amount of
operational support.

Each district manager receives continuous comprehensive training throughout their management tenure through training
sessions and meetings with their regional managers. These training sessions and meetings focus on management techniques, new product announcements, advanced automotive systems training and our policies and procedures. In turn, the information
presented at such training sessions and meetings is covered by the district managers at monthly meetings with their store managers. All store managers are required to successfully complete a six-month manager-training program, which includes
classroom and field training. This program covers all facets of store operations, as well as principles of successful management. In addition, all new or prospective managers attend a manager development program, at the corporate headquarters in
Springfield, Missouri, which includes 40 hours of classroom training. Upon returning to the stores, managers are given continuous field training throughout their management tenure.

We provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through incentive compensation programs. Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by
incentive compensation based upon their individual and/or store’s sales and profitability. In addition, each of our district and store managers participates in the Company’s stock option program. We believe that our incentive compensation
programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our district and store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.

Most of our current senior management, district managers and store managers were promoted to their positions from within the Company. Our senior management
team averages 16 years of service, corporate management team averages over 13 years of service and district management team have an average length of service of over 10 years.

Team Members

As of January 31, 2010, we employed 44,822 total team members
(30,379 full-time team members and 14,443 part-time team members), of whom 37,517 were employed at our stores, 5,756 were employed at our distribution centers and 1,549 were employed at our corporate and regional offices. A union represents 53
stores’ team members in the Greater Bay Area in California, and has for many years – except for these team members, our team members are not represented by a labor union. Our tradition of 53 years has been to treat all of our team members
with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “Live Green” Culture, which emphasizes the importance of every team member’s contribution to the success of O’Reilly. This focus on
professionalism and fairness has created an industry-leading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent.

Inflation and Seasonality

We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases
principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases
industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.

To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. Store sales and profits
have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our
business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.



As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our
customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs. We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores
as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party vendors. The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates, deposited into vendor-supplied containers and pallets and then disposed of by the third-party vendors.
In general, our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to
off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the vendor.

Compliance with any such laws
and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. We cannot give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation.

Store Operations

Store Network

Store Locations.

As a result of our dual market strategy, we
are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. The following table sets forth
the geographic distribution of our stores:



Our stores, on average, carry approximately 22,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,000 total square feet in
size. At December 31, 2009, we had a total of approximately 24.2 million square feet in our 3,421 stores. Our stores are served primarily by the nearest distribution center, but they also have access to the broader selection of inventory
available at one of our 196 Master Inventory Stores, which on average carry approximately 38,000 SKUs and average approximately 9,900 square feet in size. In addition to serving DIY and professional installer customers in their markets, Master
Inventory Stores also provide our other stores within the contiguous area access to a greater selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.

We
believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity. Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings and
prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares, and offer ample parking, easy customer access and proximity to our installer customers.

Store Layout.

We utilize a computer-assisted “plan-o-grammed” store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent merchandise presentation; however, each store’s hard-parts
inventory assortment is customized to meet the specific needs of a particular market area. Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to
customers. To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual in-store signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area. Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand or
seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.

Store Automation.

To enhance store-level operations, customer service and
reliability, we use IBM I-Series and X-Series computer systems in stores that have converted to the O’Reilly systems. These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our distribution centers. Our point-of-sale terminals
provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle and use bar code scanning technology to price our merchandise. This system speeds transaction times, reduces
the customer’s checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service. Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and
distribution efficiency. As CSK stores are converted to O’Reilly stores, IBM I-Series and X-Series computer systems are installed in the converted store, linking the store to our distribution centers, electronic catalog and pricing information.

New Store Site Selection.

In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within
geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are bulleted below:

•

population density and segmentation;

•

market economic strength, retail draw and growth patterns;

•

age, ethnicity and per capita income;

•

number of registered vehicles;

•

the number, type and sales potential of existing automotive repair facilities;

•

the number of auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors; and

•

physical location, size, economics and presentation of the site.

When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and
achieve economies of scale. After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas. This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each
market.

Products and Purchasing

Our stores offer DIY and professional installer customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks. We do not sell tires or perform
automotive repairs or installations. Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products such as AC Delco, Armor All, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Federal Mogul, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil,
Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix. In addition to name brand products, our stores carry a wide variety of high-quality private label products under our BestTest

proprietary name brands. Our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers
and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our DIY customers. We have added O’Reilly branded chemicals and commodities as well as
proprietary private label products to all converted and nonconverted, acquired CSK stores. These stores have also undergone hard-part resets, which significantly increased their hard-part SKU offering, giving our customers in all stores a good,
better, and best product offering.



We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors, the five largest of which
accounted for approximately 24% of our total purchases in 2009. Our largest vendor in 2009 accounted for approximately nine percent of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately three to four percent of
such purchases. We have no long-term contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources
exist at substantially similar costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms
available from vendors. During 2009, we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases. As a whole, we consider our relationships with our vendors to be
very good.

Pricing

We believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business. Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served
by each store. Most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price with
additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing. Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our
competitors in the same market area.

We have repositioned the product offering and pricing in all CSK stores to an every-day low price
strategy to ensure we are competitive in every market. We feel competitive pricing is needed to grow our market share and maintain a customer’s repeat business, and we feel strongly that this strategy is more sustainable, requires less
promotional spending and will produce better results than CSK’s historical promotional-based, high-low pricing strategy.

Professional Parts People

We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing
superior customer service to both DIY and professional installer customers. Because a significant portion of our business is from installers, our Professional Parts People are required to be technically proficient in automotive products. In
addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from a Professional Parts Person, particularly when purchasing hard parts. The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer
creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.

We screen prospective team members to identify
highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude. New store team members go through a comprehensive orientation about the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their
specific job position. Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems training to prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
Parts specialists also receive ongoing product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers.

All of our stores have the ability to service professional installer customers. For this reason, select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager. Afterward, these team members
spend one day per week calling on existing and potential professional installer customers. Additionally, each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.

Customer Service

We
seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products. We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional
installer customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products requested. Accordingly, each O’Reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a
wide range of vehicle applications. We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates
and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.

Marketing

Marketing to the DIY Customer.

We aggressively promote sales to DIY customers through an integrated marketing program, which includes television,
radio, direct mail and newspaper advertising, in-store and online promotions, and sports and event sponsorships.



Our marketing activities have resulted in a significant increase in our brand awareness across our
geographic footprint. We utilize a combination of brand and product/price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events. During 2009, we continued to co-brand our advertising in the markets where
nonconverted CSK stores are located. This advertising and marketing is essential to build awareness of the O’Reilly Brand in those markets to allow for a smoother transition as stores are rebranded. In addition to co-branding in these select
markets, we have co-branded all existing CSK advertising programs that have national exposure.

To stimulate sales to race enthusiasts, who we
believe on an individual basis spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally televised races and over 1,500 grassroots, local, and regional motorsports events in 38 states during 2009. We continued our
partnership with NASCAR as the Official Auto Parts Store of NASCAR and in the fall of 2009 we sponsored the Checker O’Reilly Auto Parts 500 NASCAR Sprint Cup race, at the Phoenix International Raceway.

During the fall and winter, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”) basketball and the National Football League
(“NFL”). We have relationships with over 80 NCAA teams and tournaments resulting in the placement of the O’Reilly logo on courts, goal stanchions, seat backs, kick plates, and scoring table signs throughout the season. O’Reilly
Auto Parts radio advertising can be heard in approximately 200 NFL games through our sponsorship of a dozen teams.

In 2009, we continued our
dedicated problem/solution messaging strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long term. We expanded our Hispanic marketing efforts to capture
incremental sales from this dynamic and growing consumer segment.

Marketing to the Professional Installer.

We have over 450 full-time
O’Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas. Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional installer customers. Targeted marketing materials such as
flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional installers, paint and body shops and fleet customers. Our industry leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district
managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional installer accounts by providing the products and services bulleted below:

•

broad selection of merchandise at competitive prices;

•

dedicated Installer Service Specialists in our stores;

•

multiple deliveries from our stores per day;

•

same-day or overnight access to an average of 118,000 SKUs through five-night-a-week store inventory replenishments;

•

a separate service counter and phone line in our stores dedicated exclusively to service professional installers;

•

trade credit for qualified accounts;

•

First Call Online, a dedicated Internet based catalog and ordering system designed to connect professional installers directly to our inventory system;

•

training and seminars covering topics of interest, such as technical updates, safety and general business management;

•

access to a comprehensive inventory of products and equipment needed to operate and maintain their shop; and

•

the Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional installers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and
market their shops.

Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store.

Along with the daily operation and management
of the distribution centers and the distribution of automotive products to our stores, Ozark Automotive Distributors, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary (“Ozark”), also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores
(“jobber stores”) throughout our trade areas. These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O’Reilly store. Ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber
stores.

Approximately 183 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from Ozark and participate in our Parts City Auto Parts
program, our proprietary jobber service program. As a participant in these programs, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of the
respective logo that is owned by Ozark. We provide advertising, promotional assistance, marketing and sales support to Parts City Auto Parts stores purchasing automotive products from Ozark. In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products
from Ozark, we offer assistance to Parts City Auto Parts jobber stores by making available computer software for business management and inventory control.

Competition

We compete in both the DIY and professional installer portions of the
automotive aftermarket. We compete primarily with the stores bulleted below:



•

national retail and wholesale automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, NAPA, CARQUEST and the Pep Boys- Manny, Moe and
Jack, Inc.);

•

regional retail and wholesale automotive parts chains;

•

independently owned parts stores;

•

wholesalers or jobber stores (some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA, CARQUEST, Bumper
to Bumper and Auto Value);

•

automobile dealers; and

•

mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).

We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, price, helpfulness of
store personnel, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.

Distribution System Support

We currently operate 21 distribution centers comprised of approximately 7.4 million operating square feet (see the “Properties” table in
Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of distribution center operating square footages). Our distribution centers are equipped with highly automated material handling equipment, which efficiently expedite the movement of our products
from the shelves to the loading areas for shipment to each of our stores on a nightly basis. The distribution centers utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores. In addition to the bar code
system employed in our stores, each of our stores is connected through secured data transmission technology to our distribution centers and corporate headquarters.

We believe that our distribution system provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory. Moreover, we
believe that our ongoing, significant capital investments made to expand the network of distribution centers allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store
network. Our distribution center expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each distribution center. We opened a new distribution center in
Greensboro, North Carolina in the summer of 2009, to service existing stores in that area and to expand in the Mid-Atlantic States. We currently have a total growth capacity of approximately 350 stores in our current 21 distribution centers.

In order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the CSK store network, we added distribution centers in Seattle, Washington,
in November of 2009 and Moreno Valley, California, in January of 2010. Following these openings, two additional new distribution centers will be opened in Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah, in the first half of 2010. The Seattle, Moreno
Valley and Denver distribution centers were purchased existing facilities, while the land for the Salt Lake City distribution center was purchased and the distribution center is being constructed. After a detailed evaluation of the existing CSK
Dixon, California, distribution center, we made the decision to relocate this distribution center to a larger facility in Stockton, California, which will open in the summer of 2010. We closed one CSK distribution center in Mendota Heights,
Minnesota, in the spring of 2009 that directly overlapped a larger, existing O’Reilly distribution center in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.

As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2010 we plan to:

•

add three new distribution centers (“DCs”), relocate and convert an existing acquired CSK DC and convert an existing acquired CSK DC;

•

continue to implement a voice picking technology in additional distribution centers;

•

develop further automated paperless picking processes;

•

improve proof of delivery systems to further increase the accuracy of product movement to our stores;

•

implement our dedicated private delivery fleet model in the Western United States enabling us to further reduce logistics costs and provide a higher
service level to our stores;

•

continue to define and implement best practice procedures in all distribution centers; and

•

make proven, ROI based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in distribution centers including conveyor systems, picking modules and lift
equipment.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Our future
performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based
upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forward-looking statements.

Current economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others
with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the United States, and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Although demand for many of
our products is non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on discretionary spending by our customers. Discretionary spending is affected
by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that
influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Our customers’ purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in
response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue to challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may
result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit
facilities and interest rate swap transactions. In addition, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. If third parties, on which we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the
deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities or interest rate swap transactions do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

The integration of the operations of CSK involves risks, and the failure to
integrate the operations successfully or in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company.

The failure of the Company to meet the challenges involved in integrating the operations of CSK successfully or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could seriously harm our results of operations. Our
ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition will depend, in part, on the timely integration of organizations, operations, procedures, policies and technologies, as well as the successful adoption of the O’Reilly culture and the retention
of key personnel. The integration of CSK will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, even with proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt the Company’s business. The challenges involved in this integration
include the following:

•

implementing O’Reilly distribution, point of sale and inventory management systems;

•

combining respective product offerings;

•

preserving customer, supplier and other important relationships of both O’Reilly and CSK and resolving potential conflicts that may arise;

•

minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

•

contingencies that may arise of which we were not aware or of which we underestimated the significance;

•

addressing differences in the business cultures of O’Reilly and CSK to maintain employee morale and retain key employees; and

•

coordinating and combining geographically diverse operations, relationships and facilities which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by
distance and local laws and regulations.

We may not successfully integrate the operations of CSK in a timely manner, or not
at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger to the extent, or in the time frame, anticipated. The anticipated benefits and synergies are based on projections and assumptions, not actual experience, and assume a
successful integration. In addition to the integration risks discussed above, our ability to realize these benefits and synergies could be adversely affected by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations. If we fail to
manage the integration of these businesses effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger.



Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our
obligations.

In conjunction with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a new credit facility, which significantly increased our
outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements. Our substantial debt could have important consequences, such as:

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to principal and interest, thereby reducing
our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other cash requirements;

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;

•

limiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all; and

•

exposing us to fluctuations in interest rates.

In addition, the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing, subsidiary guarantees and asset and stock pledges. A failure
to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the
inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.

We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations,
examples of such risks include the following:

•

we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable
terms;

•

our management’s attention may be distracted;

•

we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses;

•

we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems;

•

we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize
economic, operational and other benefits; and

•

we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, as a successor owner or operator, may be liable.

The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.

Both the DIY and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated
areas that we serve. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. We may
have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive. For a list of our principal competitors, see the “Competition” section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees, which may be more difficult in light of uncertainty created by the
acquisition of CSK, and failure to do so could seriously harm the Company.

In order to be successful, we will need to retain and
motivate executives and other key employees. Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. Employee retention may be a particularly challenging issue in connection with the
integration of the acquired CSK operations. We also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals, which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions of the merger.

We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.

We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. Our ability to accomplish our growth
objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions. We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2010 and beyond will be achieved. Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the
“Growth Strategy” section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.



We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our costs and sales.

Approximately 30% of our stores are located in Texas and California. Therefore, our business is sensitive to the economic and weather
conditions of those regions. Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period
and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers. In addition, our stores located in these coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.

Legal proceedings and related matters arising from CSK could adversely affect us.

As discussed in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 14 “Legal Matters” of the consolidated financial
statements, several of CSK’s former officers and employees have been charged by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and named in civil actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). O’Reilly has resolved
CSK’s pre-acquisition issues with the SEC, but as set forth in Item 3 and Note 14 “Legal Matters”, the DOJ investigation continues and could result in criminal charges being filed against CSK. We are involved in working toward
resolution of these matters. Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and O’Reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the
behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters. There can be no assurance that the expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of these matters will be covered by CSK’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies. If
we incur significant uninsured expenses in connection with the resolution of the matters described above, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price.

All of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule. We cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of
the common stock prevailing from time to time. We believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.

Risks related to the Company and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect the Company’s stock price.

We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future operating
results of the Company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. We cannot be
certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of CSK will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our
business would likely suffer.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action
litigation.

The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and
market conditions. The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations. Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons
unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities
class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could have an
adverse effect on our business.

A change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at
competitive prices could affect our financial health.

Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our
vendors and on our vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us
products on favorable terms. For example, financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them. In addition, the trend
towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.



Complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise
may affect our business.

We operate 21 distribution centers nationwide to support our business. If complications arise with any
facility or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands. This may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a nightly basis and
therefore affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales. Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations, such as by increasing fuel prices, and therefore increase our operating costs.

Initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, which
could adversely impact all industries. While it is uncertain whether these will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming, and these mandates, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, including,
among other things, increasing fuel prices.

expenses and an original term of, at a minimum, 10 years, subject to one or more renewals at our option. We have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby. Such
master lease agreements with two of the three O’Reilly family entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores. The master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from
May 31, 2010, to December 31, 2029. We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.

We believe that our present facilities are in good condition, are adequately insured and, together with those under construction, are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our current operations. The
store servicing capacity of our 21 distribution centers is just over 3,800 stores, with a growth capacity of over 350 stores; our total growth capacity will increase to over 600 stores after the opening of our additional distribution centers in
2010. We believe this growth capacity will be adequate for near-term store growth.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

O’Reilly Litigation

O’Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the
Company’s business. Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period. In addition, O’Reilly is involved in resolving the governmental investigations that were being conducted against CSK prior to its
acquisition by O’Reilly.

CSK Pre-Acquisition Matters – Governmental Investigations and Actions

As previously reported, the pre-acquisition SEC investigation of CSK, which commenced in 2006, was settled in May 2009 by administrative order without fines,
disgorgement or other financial remedies. However, the DOJ’s criminal investigation into these same matters remains ongoing. In addition, the previously reported SEC complaint against four (4) former employees of CSK for alleged conduct
related to CSK’s historical accounting practices remains ongoing, though one of those former employees died in January, 2010. The action filed by the SEC on July 22, 2009, against Maynard L. Jenkins, the former chief executive officer of
CSK seeking reimbursement from Mr. Jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as previously reported, also continues. The previously reported DOJ criminal complaint against
two (2) of the former employees of CSK remains ongoing. However, given the recent death of one (1) of those former employees, we expect no further action with respect to such former employee.



With respect to the ongoing DOJ investigation discussed above, attorneys from the DOJ have indicated that as
a result of conduct alleged against the former employees, as set forth in the pleadings in United States vs. Fraser, et. al., U.S.Dist.Ct., Dist. of Ariz.; Case No: 2:09-cr-00372-SRB-2, the DOJ is considering whether to file criminal charges against
CSK. O’Reilly is engaged in discussions with the DOJ to attempt to resolve the matter. O’Reilly cannot predict the outcome of these discussions at this time. O’Reilly intends to vigorously defend against any such charges if filed. The
probability of criminal charges being filed against CSK or the magnitude of the costs to resolve these issues cannot now be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements do not reflect an accrued liability for this
contingency.

Several of CSK’s former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed as part of or
become the subject of criminal, administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits. As described above, certain former employees of CSK are the subject of civil and criminal litigation commenced by the government. Under Delaware law, the charter
documents of the CSK entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and O’Reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters. Some of
these indemnification obligations and other related costs may not be covered by CSK’s insurance policies.

As a result of the CSK
acquisition, O’Reilly expects to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to the ongoing DOJ investigation of CSK and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced by the DOJ and SEC of CSK’s former employees.
O’Reilly recorded an assumed liability for such fees in the Company’s allocation of purchase price of CSK, of which $20.7 million remains accrued as of December 31, 2009. O’Reilly has paid approximately $4.0 million of such legal
costs related to the government investigations and indemnity obligations in 2009.

The foregoing governmental investigations and
indemnification matters are subject to many uncertainties, and, given their complexity and scope, their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time. It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company’s results of
operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of such matters, depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. However, at this time, management believes that the
ultimate outcome of all of such regulatory proceedings that are pending, after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits not contemplated in recorded reserves, should not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.



PART II

Item 5.

Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The Company’s stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “ORLY”. As of February 22, 2010,
O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. had approximately 64,150 shareholders based on the number of holders of record and an estimate of individual participants represented by security position listings. The Company’s common stock began trading on
April 22, 1993. No cash dividends have been declared since 1992, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

As a result of the death of Mr. Joe C. Greene, an independent Director of the Company’s Board of Directors, on May 8, 2009, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that it was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5605 which requires that a majority of the board of directors be comprised of independent directors. The company currently has eight directors, four of which qualify as independent. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), the
Company has a “cure period” of until the next annual shareholders’ meeting to regain compliance. To that end, on February 11, 2010, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
nominated Thomas T. Hendrickson as an independent Class II Director. Mr. Hendrickson will stand for election at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

The prices in the following table represent the high and low sales price for O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market. During fiscal 2009, the Company
made no purchases or repurchases of its common stock.

The following table sets forth shares
authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans at December 31, 2009:

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The table
below compares the Company’s selected financial data over a ten-year period. In 2001, 2005 and 2008, the Company acquired Mid-State Automotive Distributors, Midwest Auto Parts Distributors and CSK Auto Corporation, respectively. The 2001
Mid-State acquisition added 82 stores, the 2005 Midwest acquisition added 72 stores and the 2008 CSK acquisition added 1,342 stores to the O’Reilly store count. Financial results for these acquired companies have been included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements from the dates of the acquisitions forward.

(a)

The cumulative change in accounting method, effective January 1, 2004, changed the method of applying LIFO accounting policy for certain inventory costs. Under the
new method, included in the value of inventory are certain procurement, warehousing and distribution center costs. The previous method was to recognize those costs as incurred, reported as a component of costs of goods sold.

(b)

The pro forma income statement reflects the retroactive application of the cumulative effect of the accounting change to historical periods.



(a)

Store count for 2002 does not include 27 stores acquired from Dick Smith Enterprises and Davie Automotive, Inc. in December 2002.

(b)

Total square footage includes normal selling, office, stockroom and receiving space. Sales per weighted-average store and square foot are weighted to consider the
approximate dates of store openings or expansions.

(c)

Same-store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year. Percentage increase in same-store sales is calculated based on store
sales results, which exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales by outside salesmen and sales to team members.

(d)

Same-store sales for 2008 include sales for stores acquired in the CSK acquisition. Comparable stores sales for O’Reilly stores open at least one year increased
2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Comparable stores sales for CSK stores open at least one year decreased 1.7% for the portion of CSK’s sales in 2008 since the July 11, 2008, acquisition.

(e)

Same-store sales for 2009 include sales for stores acquired in the CSK acquisition. Comparable stores sales for stores operating on O’Reilly systems open at least
one year increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Comparable stores sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system open at least one year increased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009.

OVERVIEW

O’Reilly
Automotive, Inc. is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both
do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional installers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related
materials, automotive tools and professional installer service equipment. As of December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores in 38 states.

Operating within the retail industry, we, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits
and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our company and the retail sector in general. We cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic
conditions will change.

We believe that the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, average vehicle age, new light
vehicle sales, unperformed maintenance and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket.

Number of U.S. miles driven and number of U.S. registered vehicles:

Total miles driven in
the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell. The long-term trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade. Between 1999
and 2007, the total number of miles driven in the United States increased at an annual rate of approximately 1.6%. According to the Department of Transportation, estimated total number of miles driven declined by 3.6% in 2008 and increased slightly
in 2009. The relatively flat number of miles driven during 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to lower fuel costs compared to those in 2008, but the overall decrease in miles driven in recent years is a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions.
The total number of registered vehicles on the road increased from 201 million light vehicles in 1999 to 242 million in 2008. We believe that the decrease in miles driven in 2008 and the relatively flat number of miles driven in 2009 is a
short-term trend, and that long-term miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road.



Average vehicle age and new light vehicle sales:

Changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products. As the average age of a vehicle increases, the vehicle
goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes, belts, hoses, batteries and filters. The sales of these products are a key component of our business. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry
Association (“AAIA”) the average age of the United States vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 9.1 years for passenger cars and 8.5 years for light trucks in 1999 to 10.6 and 9.3 years, respectively, in 2008. Based on
estimates provided by the AAIA, new car sales decreased 4.7% between 1999 and 2007 for the light vehicle market; however, sales for the same market decreased 18.5% in 2008. Due to difficult economic conditions and better engineered vehicles, we
expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue.

Unperformed maintenance:

According to estimates compiled by the AAIA, the annual amount of
unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the United States totaled $50 billion for 2008. This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed. Consumer decisions to avoid
or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand. We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2008 contributed to the amount of unperformed
maintenance; however, with the reduced number of new car sales, we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance is decreasing as people place a higher focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer
than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment.

Product quality differentiation:

We provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our
product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good, better, and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products
at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade-down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic
conditions. We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future.

KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Several
key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below:

•

On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK Auto Corporation (“CSK”), one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and
accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of CSK common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and
converted into the right to receive 0.4285 of a share of O’Reilly common stock and $1.00 in cash. The results of CSK’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

•

On July 11, 2008, to fund the CSK acquisition, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility
(“ABL Credit Facility”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A. (“BA”), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for our combined
Company going forward.

•

On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6


/


% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”)
originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity on December 15,
2025.

•

On each of July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we entered into interest rate swap
transactions with Branch Banking and Trust Company (“BBT”), BA, SunTrust Bank (“SunTrust”) and/or Barclays Capital (“Barclays”). We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with
our floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $500 million of our debt that is outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and
matured on November 28, 2009.

•

Since July 11, 2008, and as a result of the CSK acquisition, we have incurred and will continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing
governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against CSK and former CSK employees.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth, certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated:

2009 Compared to 2008

Sales increased $1.27 billion, or 36%, from $3.58 billion in 2008 to $4.85 billion in 2009. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2009
(in millions):

Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of
specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the O’Reilly systems
increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The O’Reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 6.6% increase for the core O’Reilly and post conversion Schuck’s stores, a 2.1% increase from the 123
converted Checker stores and a 11.9% decrease in comparable stores sales from the 141 converted Murray’s stores. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system increased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Consolidated comparable store sales increased 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009.

We believe that the increased sales achieved by
our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in
the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. We opened 149 new O’Reilly branded stores
and one new Schuck’s store in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores compared to 3,285 stores at December 31, 2008. Due to the acquisition and integration of CSK, we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150
new stores in 2010, excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of CSK; however, we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will
continue in the future.



Gross profit increased $699 million, or 43%, from $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008 to $2.33 billion
(48.0% of sales) in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2008, the increase
in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost, changes in our product mix, distribution system
improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products. Product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the
acquisition of CSK. We anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired
CSK stores throughout the year. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through
ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to DIY customers. Prior to
the acquisition of CSK, our mix of sales to DIY customers was approximately equal to sales to professional installer customers. At the time of the acquisition in July of 2008, acquired CSK stores generated more than 90% of their total sales from DIY
customers. The addition of the acquired CSK stores’ predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65% DIY and 35% professional installer. In 2009, core O’Reilly stores derived
approximately 53% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 47% from our professional installer customers, while acquired CSK stores derived approximately 84% of sales from our DIY customers and approximately 16% from our professional
installer customers. Sales to DIY customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional installers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional installers. In addition, we have added
our private label product lines to the acquired CSK stores inventory mix. Private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products. Improvements in our distribution system were the
result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. The reductions in commodity prices, without corresponding decreases in retail pricing, that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009
and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010. Additionally, in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers in our western markets, we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution
efficiencies as the new distribution center team members become proficient with the O’Reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system.

SG&A increased $497 million, or 38%, from $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008 to $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted from a full year inclusion
of CSK and new stores. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired CSK stores, which have a higher expense structure than the core O’Reilly store base, and the additional store
payroll required to complete the ongoing product-line changeovers for acquired CSK stores. These increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the CSK headquarters operations in
Phoenix, Arizona to our facilities in Springfield, Missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales.

Interest expense increased $19 million, from $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008 to $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009. The increase in interest expense is the result of a full-year of
borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of CSK in 2008, the opening of new stores, ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of CSK, the expansion of
our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the non-swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility which are
subject to variable interest rate changes. Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time charges of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of
debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility.

Our provision for income taxes
increased from $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate) to $189 million in 2009 (38.1% effective tax rate). The decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the CSK
acquisition, offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where CSK stores are located. The increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes.

As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $121 million from $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales) to $307 million in 2009 (6.3% of
sales).

Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 51% to $2.23 on 137.9 million shares
compared to $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2008, on 125.4 million shares. Our year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time and non-cash charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK. These charges included
one-time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility, a one-time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK, a one-time charge to conform the CSK
team member vacation policy with the O’Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK’s trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized



over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations. Our year ended
December 31, 2009, results included a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK’s trade names and trademarks. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges, increased 38% to $2.26
for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.64 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per share data):

The acquisition-related adjustment to EPS in the above paragraph and
table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We
believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition-related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s ongoing core
operations. Management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Material limitations of this non-GAAP
measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts and amortization of acquisition-related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets
ranging from one to three years. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

2008 Compared to 2007

Sales increased $1.05 billion, or 42%, from $2.52 billion in 2007 to
$3.58 billion in 2008, due to the acquisition of 1,342 CSK stores and the addition of 150 net new O’Reilly stores opened during 2008. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2008
(in millions):

We believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability, a
broader selection of products in most stores, targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores, compensation programs for all
store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
This increase in 2008 was less than the prior year’s increase of 3.7% and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2008 as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the CSK
acquisition. The external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers’ discretionary income resulting from inflation, declining home and investment asset values, higher gas prices in
early 2008, increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the US economy.



Comparable store sales for O’Reilly stores, including CSK stores after conversion to the O’Reilly
brand, but excluding the acquired, yet-to-be-converted CSK stores, increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Comparable store sales for acquired CSK stores open at least one year decreased 1.7% for the portion of those stores’
sales since the July 11, 2008 acquisition by O’Reilly as compared to the same period in 2007 when CSK’s sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth
consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future. We expect future sales growth as the CSK stores are converted to the O’Reilly dual market strategy. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores
open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members. Gross profit increased $508 million, or 45%, from $1.12 billion (44.4% of sales) in 2007 to $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales)
in 2008. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of CSK, the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a
percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at
each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin
percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing O’Reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion
of these sales are made to DIY customers (which typically have higher gross margin percentages) and because of market conditions, primarily overall price levels, which are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are
located. Product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lower-cost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth. Improvements in our
distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies.

SG&A increased $477 million, or
59%, from $815 million (32.3% of sales) in 2007 to $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of CSK and from additional team members and resources to support our
increased store count. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the CSK store base which has a higher expense structure than the core O’Reilly store base, a one-time charge of $9.6
million to align CSK’s vacation policy with the Company’s policy, $5.3 million of non-cash amortization of CSK trade names and trademarks and partial de-leverage of fixed SG&A expenses on low comparable store sales increases.

Interest expense increased $22 million, from $4 million (or 0.1% of sales) in 2007 to $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008. The
increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new asset-based revolving credit facility that were used to fund the CSK acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs. Other one-time charges were
incurred in 2008 of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility.

Our provision for income taxes increased from $114 million in 2007 (36.9% effective tax rate) to $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate). The
increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of CSK and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired CSK stores are located. The increase is also attributable to a one-time charge to adjust tax
liabilities in the amount $3.1 million relating to the acquisition.

As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income decreased $8
million from $194 million in 2007 (7.7% of sales) to $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales). Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.19 per share in 2008 to $1.48 per share on 125.4 million diluted shares outstanding from $1.67 per share in 2007
on 116.1 million diluted shares outstanding. The increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of CSK.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as well as our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 ($ in thousands):

(1)

Quick assets includes cash, cash equivalents and receivables.

(2)

Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.

(3)

Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.

(4)

Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities.

(


)

Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders’ equity.

Liquidity and Related Ratios

Current assets increased 19% from 2008 to 2009, primarily driven by increased investment in inventory as part of the process to properly align the acquired CSK stores with O’Reilly branded stores’ inventory levels and selection.
Current liabilities increased 17% from 2008 to 2009, primarily attributable to the presentation of our acquired 6


/


% Exchangeable Notes as short-term debt, due to the Noteholders’ right to require our repurchase of the Notes in 2010, and an increase in accounts
payable stemming from our increased inventory investment. Total working capital increased 21% from 2008 to 2009, principally as a result of our investment in inventory, offset by the related increase in accounts payable as discussed above. Total
debt increased 8% and total equity increased 18% from 2008 to 2009. The increase in debt is primarily attributable to increased borrowing levels under our ABL Facility to support the integration and conversion of CSK. The increase in total equity is
principally due to a 23% increase in retained earnings resulting from net income in 2009 and an increase in additional paid-in capital of 10% primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by
operating activities was $285 million in 2009, $299 million in 2008 and $299 million in 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009,
which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was flat with the cash provided by operating activities in 2007 principally
because an increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, and a one-time non-cash charge of $9.6 million to align, where possible, CSK’s
vacation policy with the Company’s policy. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. The increases in net inventory investment in 2008 and 2009 were the result of investments
made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. The average per-store inventory for core O’Reilly stores increased to $498,000 as of December 31, 2009, from $489,000 as of December 31,
2008. Nonconverted CSK store’s average per-store inventory increased to $595,000 as of December 31, 2009, from $461,000 as of December 31, 2008.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $411 million in 2009, $368
million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to conversions of acquired CSK stores to the O’Reilly Brand and
additional distribution centers. Capital expenditures were $415 million in 2009, $342 million in



2008, and $283 million in 2007. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008,
was due to the purchase of two distribution center facilities and land for an additional distribution center in our western markets to enhance the distribution infrastructure, the conversion of 354 acquired CSK stores to O’Reilly systems. The
increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition and in the integration of CSK, partially offset by decreased
capital expenditures for new store construction. We opened 150, 150, and 190 net stores in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In 2010, we
plan to open 150 new stores, convert 888 acquired CSK stores to O’Reilly systems, open three new distribution centers in the west, relocate and convert an existing acquired CSK distribution center to O’Reilly systems and convert an
existing acquired CSK distribution center to O’Reilly systems. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated
to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Capital costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores include investments in store
computer systems, signage, fixtures, interior and exterior renovation, and delivery vehicles. The average estimated capital conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately $135,000. Total capital expenditures in 2010 are expected to range
from $400 million to $450 million.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $121 million in 2009, $53 million in 2008 and $19 million in 2007. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was the result of a reduction
in payments on long term debt in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relating to the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK in 2008
and an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans along with the increase in the associated tax benefit from the exercises partially offset by reduced borrowings under our asset-based credit
facility. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our asset-based credit facility, which was partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing
debt and debt assumed in the CSK acquisition, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK.

Sources of Liquidity

Our current business strategy requires capital to open new stores, convert acquired CSK stores, expand
distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our ABL Credit Facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns
could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our Credit Agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds
available under our ABL Credit Facility. In 2010, we plan to open 150 new stores and open three new distribution centers in our Western markets. We also plan to relocate an existing acquired CSK distribution center in Northern California to a larger
facility and plan to convert our acquired Phoenix distribution center to O’Reilly systems. In addition, we plan to convert 888 acquired CSK stores to O’Reilly systems in 2010. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating
activities and availability under our ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, if our liquidity is insufficient, we may be forced to limit our
planned expansion in 2010. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.

Credit
Facility

On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion
asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit Facility”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity
for the combined Company going forward. This facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million.

The ABL Credit Facility is comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility (FILO tranche). On the date of the
transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement, under the ABL Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million. We used borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility to repay certain
existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of the borrowing base available under the
credit facility was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which we had outstanding borrowings of $679 million and $614 million, respectively. The available borrowings under the credit facility are also reduced by stand-by letters of credit
issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had stand-by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $72 million and $56
million, respectively, and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under the credit facility was $445 million and $454 million, respectively. As part of the Credit Agreement, we have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral
and we are subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which we complied on December 31, 2009 and 2008. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be
taken; these actions include, but are not limited to, the summarized items below:



•

termination of credit extensions;

•

any outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest could become immediately payable;

•

cash collateralization of all letter of credit obligations; and/or

•

litigation from lenders.

Borrowings under the tranche A revolver bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.25% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess
availability thresholds. Borrowings under the FILO tranche bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 2.5% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain
excess availability thresholds. The base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by Bank of America from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 1.25%. Fees related to unused
capacity under the ABL Credit Facility are assessed at a rate of 0.375% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of
credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility.

On July 24, 2008, October 14,
2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with BBT, BA, SunTrust and/or Barclays. We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our
floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $500 million of our debt that is outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2008. We are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the
notional amounts, while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount. The interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on
these notional amounts of our debt, which exists under the Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin under the terms of the same credit facility. The interest rate swap transactions have maturity dates ranging from August 1, 2010, through
October 17, 2011. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009, increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional
amount of $400 million as of December 31, 2009. On January 21, 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with Barclays in the amount of $50 million, reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount
of $450 million as of that date.

Senior Exchangeable Notes

On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6


/


% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the
“Notes”) originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.50% until maturity on
December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, the Notes are exchangeable by the holders only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued):

•

during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our common
stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days;

•

if we have called the Notes for redemption; or

•

upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control.

Upon exchange of the Notes, we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged and our total exchange
obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess. The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each
$1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 25.9697 shares of our common stock and $60.6061 in cash. The incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were included in the diluted earnings per share
calculation for the year ended December 31, 2009, however the incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the impact would
have been antidilutive.

The Noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture.
We may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. Our intention is to redeem the
Notes in December of 2010, and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility.



OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our
consolidated financial statements. We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe,
however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans.

On
December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash. The lease,
which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has
been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5.5 million annually.

In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O’Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O’Reilly Auto Parts stores and
generated approximately $5.6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options.

On September 28, 2007, we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our $49 million Synthetic Operating Lease Facility
with a group of financial institutions. The terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years, a residual value guarantee of approximately $39.7 million at December 31, 2007 and purchase options on the properties.
On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we purchased all the properties included in our Synthetic Operating Lease Facility for $49.3 million, thus terminating the facility. The purchase was funded through borrowings under
the ABL Credit Facility.

On July 11, 2008, and as a result of the acquisition, we entered into a master lease agreement with ARI Fleet
LT (“ARI”), which was originally entered into on March 19, 2001, by CSK. The lease agreement with ARI is for the lease of all of CSK’s delivery and management vehicles, which is accounted for as a capital lease. Under the master
agreement, a lease contract is created on each vehicle, with terms typically ranging from 50 to 60 months. Interest expense on the capital lease totaled $0.3 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. At December 31,
2009 and 2008, the book value of the ARI master lease agreement was $3.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively.

We issue stand-by letters of
credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the ABL Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings. These letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance
policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $72.3 million and $55.6 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Deferred income taxes, self-insurance accruals, interest payments on our variable rate long-term debt and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in “Other
liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled
maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2010, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets.

Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, included commitments for future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term
debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 4
“Long-Term Debt” and Note 6 “Commitments” to the consolidated financial statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, through borrowings under our
ABL Credit Facility or through future borrowings.

We may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price
of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. Our intention is to redeem the Notes in December of 2010, and we plan to fund the redemption with
available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires the
application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial
statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review
these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be
material.

•

Vendor concessions

– We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative
advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes,
are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts
due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors’ financial position
and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is
a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses
or gains that could be material.



•

Self-Insurance Reserves

– We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from
workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party
insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including
historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most
probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported
as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material
losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised
estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical
patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were
changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $9.1 million or 1.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009.

•

Accounts Receivable

– We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for
doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management’s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be
a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or
gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.7 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31,
2009.

•

Taxes

– We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex
issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax
regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various
jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must
use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax
positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. Our judgment regarding the most likely outcome of uncertain tax positions has historically resulted in an estimate
of our tax liability that is greater than actual results. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different
from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.

•

Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink

– Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated
at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long
period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our
inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower
than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will
be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the
factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.

We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded
shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers. To



the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have
historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink were changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience
at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $1.2 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009.

•

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

– We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential
impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows
and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results
could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.

We review
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on December 31, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an
impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain
judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that
an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill
or other intangible assets is required as of December 31, 2009, nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to
determine the Company’s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been
required.

Closed Property Reserves

– We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations.
We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing
date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the
closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original
estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been
approximately $2.3 million or 0.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009.

•

Legal Reserves

– We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are
currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations that are being conducted against CSK and litigation commenced against its former employees for alleged conduct
relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as
an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK, which was finalized on June 30, 2009. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities
arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $2.4 million or 0.5% of pretax
income for the year ended December 31, 2009.

INFLATION AND SEASONALITY

For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking
advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically
been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.



To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on
customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and
fourth quarters of the year.

QUARTERLY RESULTS

The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2009 and 2008. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a
fair presentation of the information shown.

The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued the Consolidation Topic (“ASC 810”) of the
FASB ASC, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. ASC 810 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity.
The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. ASC 810 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, but will affect only those entities that have an
outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The provisions of ASC 810 were effective for us beginning January 1, 2009, and are applied prospectively. The adoption of ASC 810 did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued the Derivatives
and Hedging Topic (“ASC 815”) of the FASB ASC, which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of
credit-risk-related contingent features contained within derivatives. ASC 815 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of ASC
815 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. ASC 815 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
application encouraged. We have adopted the provisions of ASC 815 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.

In May 2008, the FASB issued the Debt with Conversions and Other Options Topic (“ASC 470”) of the FASB ASC, which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in
cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the
issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent



periods. ASC 470 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity
if certain criteria are met and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. ASC 470 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2008, with early application prohibited. We adopted the provisions of ASC 470 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009; however, the retrospective adoption of ASC 470
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 “Long-Term Debt” to the consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued the Financial Instruments Topic (“ASC 825”) of the FASB ASC. This Topic requires quarterly disclosure of the
methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of all financial instruments, and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 825 beginning with our condensed
consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2009, the FASB issued the Subsequent Events Topic (“ASC 855”) of the FASB ASC. ASC 855 incorporates into authoritative accounting
literature certain guidance that already existed within generally accepted auditing standards. ASC 855 addresses events which occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements. Under ASC 855, as under current
practice, an entity must record the effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must disclose, but not record, the effects of subsequent events which provide evidence about
conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date. In addition, ASC 855 requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. ASC 855 is effective for interim and annual periods
ended after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 855 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the Generally Accepted Accounting Standards Topic (“ASC 105”) of the FASB ASC. ASC 105 defines the FASB ASC as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental
U.S. GAAP, superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”), Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”), and related accounting literature. This standard reorganizes the thousands of GAAP
pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure; also included, is relevant Securities and Exchange Commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections. ASC 105 is
effective for reporting periods ended after September 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 105 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, and our financial statements and
related disclosures reflect the newly adopted codification.

In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
number 2009-05 (“ASU 2009-05”), an update to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic (“ASC 820”). This update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical
liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using (a) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities and/or
(b) an income approach valuation technique or a market approach valuation technique, consistent with the principles of ASC 820. This update is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. We
adopted this update beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2009; the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates. Primarily as a result of borrowings in 2008 to fund the acquisition of CSK, we have
interest rate exposure with respect to the $679 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2009; however, from time to time, we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure. On July 24,
2008, October 14, 2008, and November 24, 2008, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts (“the Swaps”) with a total notional amount of $450 million. The interest rate
swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009, increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates by $50 million, to a total notional amount of $400 million. On
January 21, 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with Barclays on an additional $50 million of the Company’s outstanding floating rate debt. The Swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest
payments periodically over the life of the Swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit
loss. The Swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $2.8 million
($1.7 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the Swaps. This analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could
exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates. In the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, management would likely take further actions
that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The management of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”), under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Internal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no
matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(“COSO”) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 26, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Business

O’Reilly
Automotive, Inc. (the “Company”) is a specialty retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies and accessories to both the do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customer and the professional installer in 38 states.

Reclassification

Certain
prior period amounts may have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported totals for assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity, cash flows or net income.

Principles of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. On July 11, 2008, the Company completed the
acquisition of CSK Auto Corporation (“CSK”), one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. The results of
CSK’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

Revenue
Recognition

Over-the-counter retail sales are recorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Sales to professional
installers, also referred to as “commercial sales,” are recorded upon same-day delivery of the merchandise to the customer, generally at the customer’s place of business. Wholesale sales to other retailers, also referred to as
“jobber sales,” are recorded upon shipment of the merchandise from a regional distribution center with same-day delivery to the jobber customer’s location. All sales are recorded net of estimated allowances, discounts and taxes.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the day of purchase.

Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer
credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.

Inventory

Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower
of cost or market. Inventory also includes related procurement, warehousing and distribution center costs. Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, which is a better matching of costs with revenues. The
replacement cost of inventory was $1,921,961,000 and $1,630,549,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Amounts
Receivable from Vendors

The Company receives concessions from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including
co-operative advertising, devaluation programs, allowances for warranties and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to the Company’s advertising program, specific to a product or event and
identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts
receivable from vendors also includes amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise and product returns. The Company regularly reviews vendor receivables for collectability and assesses



the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on an evaluation of the Company’s vendors’
financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations. Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the amounts receivable from vendors and the Company did not record
a reserve for uncollectible amounts in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Debt Issuance Costs

Deferred debt issuance costs totaled $30,172,000 and $39,155,000, net of amortization, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of
which $8,553,000 and $8,648,000 were included in “Other current assets” as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The remainder was included in “Other assets” as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Deferred debt
issuance costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the corresponding long-term debt issue and are included in interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Property and Equipment

Property and
equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of the assets. The
lease term includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to renew options would result in a substantial economic penalty to the Company. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon
retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the gain or loss, if any, is included in the determination of net income as a component of other income (expense). The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

Property and
equipment consists of the following (in thousands):

The gross value of capital lease assets included in the
“Furniture, fixtures and equipment” amounts of the above table was $17,393,000 and $13,203,000 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The gross value of capital lease assets included in the “Vehicles” amount of the
above table was $9,722,000 and $10,371,000 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded accumulated amortization on all capital lease assets in the amount of $10,536,000 and
$3,962,000, respectively, all of which is included in accumulated depreciation and amortization in the above table.

The Company capitalizes
interest costs as a component of construction in progress, based on the weighted-average rates paid for long-term borrowings. Total interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, were $6,715,000, $2,318,000 and
$2,554,000, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, include goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as the result of previous acquisitions. The Company assesses goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually on December 31, rather than systematically amortizing goodwill against earnings. The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company
operates as one reporting unit, and its fair value exceeds its carrying value, including goodwill. Therefore, the Company has determined that no impairment of goodwill existed at December 31, 2009 and 2008.



Operating Leases

The Company’s policy is to amortize leasehold improvements over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of those assets. Generally, the lease term for stores is the base lease
term and the lease term for distribution centers includes the base lease term plus certain renewal option periods for which renewal is reasonably assured and failure to exercise the renewal option would result in a significant economic penalty. The
Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over these lease terms.

Notes Receivable

The Company had notes receivable from vendors and other third parties amounting to $16,591,000 and $28,221,000 at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The notes receivable, which bear interest at rates ranging from 0% to 10%, are due in varying amounts through August 2017.

Self-Insurance Reserves

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential
liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, the
Company obtains third-party insurance coverage to limit its exposure. The Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal
inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. These liabilities are recorded at their net present value.

Warranty Costs

The Company offers warranties on the merchandise it sells with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to lifetime, limited warranties. The
risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of the Company’s vendors, but for a small portion of merchandise sold, the Company bears the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Estimated warranty
costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. The Company’s historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that
the ultimate cost of warranty claims to the Company has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. To the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of
accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense, the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company’s accounting policies for
derivative financial instruments are based on whether the instruments meet the criteria for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges. A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or a liability
qualifies as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability qualifies as a fair value hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the assessment of the
instrument’s effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction and the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, the
Company reports the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassifies it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction
affects earnings, and within the same income statement line item as the impact of the hedged transaction. For derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation, the Company would recognize gains or losses from the change in fair value of
these derivatives, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item, in earnings.

The Company currently holds
derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The Company has designated these derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. The derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in “Other
liabilities and “Other long-term liabilities”. Derivative instruments recorded at fair value as liabilities totaled $13,053,000 and $18,874,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Derivative instruments included in
“Other liabilities” totaled $4,140,000 and $18,874,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Derivative instruments included in “Other long-term liabilities” totaled $8,913,000 as of December 31, 2009. On a
quarterly basis, the Company measures the effectiveness of the derivative financial instruments by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest to be paid or received on the variable leg of the instruments
against the expected future interest payments on the corresponding variable rate debt. In addition, the Company compares the critical terms, including notional amounts, underlying indexes and reset dates of the derivative financial instruments with
the respective variable rate debt to ensure all terms agree. Any ineffectiveness would be reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to “Interest expense.” As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no
ineffectiveness on its derivative financial instruments. See Note 8 for further information concerning these derivative instruments accounted for as hedges.



Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rules currently scheduled to
be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse, and also includes the amount of tax carry forwards. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the
enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not the amount will not be realized, based upon evidence available at the time of the determination, and any change in the
valuation allowance is recorded in the period of a change in such determination.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense charged to operations amounted to $72,927,000, $65,640,000 and $40,472,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Pre-opening Costs

Costs associated with the opening of new stores, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are charged to operations as incurred.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

The
Company currently sponsors share-based employee benefit plans and stock option plans. The Company recognizes compensation expense for its share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards on the date of the grant. Share-based payments
include stock option awards issued under the Company’s employee stock option plan, director stock option plan, stock issued through the Company’s employee stock purchase plan and stock awarded to employees through other benefit programs.
See Note 11 for further information concerning these plans.

Litigation Reserves

O’Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business. The Company records reserves for
litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss. The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred on pending litigation matters.
Although we cannot ascertain the amount of liability that we may incur from any of these matters, we do not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
or operations or cash flows. In addition, O’Reilly is involved in resolving legacy governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against former CSK employees and CSK arising out of alleged conduct relating to periods
prior to the acquisition. Further detail regarding such matters is described in Note 14.

Closed Store Liabilities

The Company maintains reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations. The Company provides for these
liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments, occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the close date, net of estimated sublease income. In conjunction with
the acquisition of CSK, the Company’s reserves include purchase accounting liabilities related to acquired properties that are no longer being utilized in the acquired business and the Company’s planned exit activities. See Note 7 for
further information concerning these liabilities.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted-average outstanding shares adjusted for the effect of common stock
equivalents. Common stock equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been antidilutive were 1,103,000, 5,184,000 and 1,613,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and notes receivable.

The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements. Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to these receivables are limited because the Company’s customer base consists of a large number of smaller customers, thus spreading the credit risk. The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring
procedures. Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and consistently have been within management’s
expectations.

The Company has entered into various derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations on its
variable rate long-term debt. If the market interest rate on the Company’s net derivative positions with counterparties exceeds a specified threshold, the counterparty is required to transfer cash in excess of the threshold to the Company.
Conversely, if the market value of the net derivative positions falls below a specified threshold, the Company is required to transfer cash below the threshold to the counterparty. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by counterparties on derivative contracts used in these hedging activities. The counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts are major financial institutions and the Company has not experienced nonperformance by any of its
counterparties.

Other than derivative instruments and the Company’s 6


/


% Exchangeable Notes (see Note 4), the Company’s non-financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt, as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, approximate fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s derivative
financial instruments has been adjusted to fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued the Consolidation Topic (“ASC 810”) of the FASB ASC, which is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. ASC 810 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The calculation of earnings per
share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. ASC 810 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one
or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The provisions of ASC 810 were effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009, and are applied prospectively. The adoption of ASC 810 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued the Derivatives and
Hedging Topic (“ASC 815”) of the FASB ASC, which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of
credit-risk-related contingent features contained within derivatives. ASC 815 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of ASC
815 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. ASC 815 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
application encouraged. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 815 beginning with its condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.

In May 2008, the FASB issued the Debt with Conversions and Other Options Topic (“ASC 470”) of the FASB ASC, which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in
cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the
issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. ASC 470 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount
on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. ASC 470 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008, with early application prohibited.
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 470 beginning with its condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009; however, the retrospective adoption of ASC 470 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows (see Note 4).

In April 2009, the FASB issued the
Financial Instruments Topic (“ASC 825”) of the FASB ASC. This Topic requires quarterly disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of all financial instruments, and is effective for interim and
annual periods ended after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 825 beginning with its condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The application of this guidance affects
disclosures only and therefore did not have an impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In May
2009, the FASB issued the Subsequent Events Topic (“ASC 855”) of the FASB ASC. ASC 855 incorporates into authoritative accounting literature certain guidance that already existed within generally accepted auditing standards. ASC 855
addresses events



which occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements. Under ASC 855, as
under current practice, an entity must record the effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must disclose, but not record, the effects of subsequent events which provide evidence
about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date. In addition, ASC 855 requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. ASC 855 is effective for interim and annual
periods ended after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 855 beginning with its condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the Generally Accepted Accounting Standards Topic (“ASC 105”) of the FASB ASC. ASC 105 defines the FASB ASC as the
single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP, superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”), Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”), and related accounting literature. This
standard reorganizes the thousands of GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure; also included is relevant Securities and Exchange Commission guidance organized using the same topical
structure in separate sections. ASC 105 is effective for reporting periods ended after September 15, 2009. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 105 beginning with its condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended
September 30, 2009, and the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures reflect the newly adopted codification.

In
August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) number 2009-05 (“ASU 2009-05”), an update to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic (“ASC 820”). This update provides clarification that in
circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using (a) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability
when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities and/or (b) an income approach valuation technique or a market approach valuation technique, consistent with the principles of ASC 820. This update is effective for the first
reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. The Company adopted this update beginning with its condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2009; the adoption of this update did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Subsequent Events

The Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction on January 21, 2010, with Barclays Capital. The Company entered into this swap transaction
to mitigate the interest rate risk on an additional $50,000,000 of the Company’s outstanding floating rate debt under its Credit Agreement. The swap transaction has an effective date of January 22, 2010, and a maturity date of
January 31, 2011. Under the terms of the swap transaction, the Company is required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on a notional amount of $50,000,000 at a fixed rate of 0.525% and the counterparty is obligated to make
certain monthly floating rate payments to the Company based on LIBOR on the same referenced notional amount.

The Company opened its second,
new distribution center in the western-half of the United States in January of 2010 in Moreno Valley, California. This distribution center is an owned facility with over 547,000 operating square feet. This facility will service the 238 Kragen stores
in the southern California area. The Kragen stores that will be serviced out of this distribution center began converting to the O’Reilly systems in January of 2010 and will continue to convert at a rate of approximately 30 stores per week. All
238 Kragen stores are expected to be converted to the O’Reilly systems and be serviced from this new distribution center by the end of the first quarter of 2010.

The Company has evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2009, through the filing of these financial statements which occurred on
February 26, 2010. Other than the events described above, no material events or transactions, which would require adjustments or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, occurred during this period.

NOTE 2 – BUSINESS COMBINATION

On
July 11, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of CSK, one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of CSK common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.4285 of a share of O’Reilly common stock and $1.00 in cash. To fund the
transaction, the Company entered into a credit agreement for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility arranged by Bank of America, N.A. (“BA”), which the Company used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition,
pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. The results of CSK’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck’s Auto
Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray’s Discount Auto Parts. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had converted 405 CSK



stores to the O’Reilly systems, merged 41 CSK stores with existing O’Reilly locations, closed 13
CSK stores and opened five new stores in CSK historical markets.

Purchase Price Allocation

The purchase price for CSK, adjusted from its initial purchase price and finalized on June 30, 2009, was comprised of the following amounts (in
thousands):

The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting with O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. as the acquiring entity in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141,

Business Combinations

. Accordingly, the consideration paid by the Company to complete the
acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The allocation of purchase price was based upon certain external valuations and other analyses,
including the review of legal reserves (see Note 14). Between the acquisition date and June 30, 2009, the Company adjusted its initial acquisition cost and preliminary purchase price allocation to reflect adjustments to certain assets,
reserves, and obligations.

O’Reilly exchanged 18,104,371 shares of common stock pursuant to the formula prescribed in the merger
agreement relating to the acquisition of CSK, dated April 1, 2008. The value of the O’Reilly stock, $25.37 per share, exchanged for CSK shares was determined based on the average close price of O’Reilly stock beginning two days before
and ending two days after June 9, 2008. The June 9, 2008, measurement date reflects the last day when the number of O’Reilly shares issuable in the transaction became fixed such that subsequent applications of the formula in the
merger agreement did not result in a change in the total number of shares exchanged. The fair value of options exchanged in the merger of $6,659,000 was based on CSK’s 3,689,761 outstanding options on July 11, 2008, multiplied by the
exchange ratio adjusted to reflect the $1.00 per share cash consideration. The weighted-average fair value per option of $3.82 was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Risk free interest rate

2.5 %

Expected life

2.3 Years

Expected volatility

29.9%

Expected dividend yield

0 %

The fair value of $1,077,000 for the
O’Reilly shares exchanged for CSK’s unvested restricted stock outstanding at July 11, 2008, was based on the fair value per O’Reilly share of $25.37 on the June 9, 2008, measurement date. Direct costs of the acquisition
include investment-banking fees, legal and accounting fees, and other external costs directly related to the acquisition.



The final purchase price allocations, adjusted from the preliminary purchase price allocation disclosed as
of December 31, 2008, and finalized on June 30, 2009, were as follows (in thousands):

The adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation disclosed
as of December 31, 2008, compared to the final purchase price allocation completed as of June 30, 2009, related to information obtained subsequent to December 31, 2008, upon completion of the purchase price allocation procedures the
Company identified at the acquisition date. The adjustments primarily related to completion of the Company’s review of CSK store locations, leases for stores to be closed and inventories to be liquidated, as well as the evaluation of the timing
and costs to be incurred under the Company’s indemnification obligations to certain former CSK officers in ongoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) investigations.
Material adjustments arising from the finalization of these planned procedures and the receipt of updated information resulted in increases to reserves for pre-acquisition legal matters of $21,814,000, exit activities, including store, distribution
center and administrative office closure reserves of $15,385,000, and inventory reserves of $6,225,000, offset by the related effects of deferred tax assets which increased $26,869,000. The net impact of all adjustments between December 31,
2008, and June 30, 2009, increased goodwill by $24,479,000.

Estimated fair values of intangible assets acquired as of the date of
acquisition are as follows (in thousands):

Intangible

assets

Weighted-

Average

Useful

Lives

(in years)

Trademarks and trade names

$

13,000

1.4

Favorable property leases

52,270

10.7

Total intangible assets

$

65,270

The estimated values of operating leases with unfavorable terms compared with current market conditions totaled
approximately $49,680,000. These liabilities have an estimated weighted-average useful life of approximately 7.7 years and are included in other liabilities. Favorable and unfavorable lease assets and liabilities are being amortized to selling,
general and administrative expense over their expected lives, which approximates the period of time that the favorable or unfavorable lease terms will be in effect. Trademarks and trade names have useful lives of one to three years and will be
amortized to coincide with the anticipated conversion of CSK store brands to the O’Reilly branded locations over that period.

The final
allocation of the purchase price included $53,961,000 of accrued liabilities for estimated costs to exit certain activities of CSK, including $14,828,000 of exit costs associated with the planned closure of 51 CSK stores, $3,650,000 of assumed
liabilities related to CSK’s existing closed stores for 127 locations that were closed prior to the Company’s acquisition of CSK, $26,617,000 of employee separation costs, and $8,866,000 of exit costs associated with the planned closure of
other administrative offices and certain distribution facilities. The Company began to formulate its exit plans prior to the completion of the acquisition. Pursuant to these



plans, between the date of the acquisition and June 30, 2009, the Company reviewed all 1,342 acquired
CSK stores to determine, from a location, lease, and facility standpoint, which stores would be closed. During the initial assessment, 33 CSK stores were identified as locations which would be merged with existing O’Reilly locations due to
overlapping market coverage; it was determined that the remaining CSK store base would be evaluated by quantitative analysis of financial and market factors in addition to evaluations of the potential for further development of commercial business
in those markets. From the initial assessment through June 30, 2009, and as contemplated in its initial exit plan, the Company completed a detailed review of custom demographic reports, which included do-it-yourself customer forecasting,
wholesale sales potential and strength and quantity of competitors in the respective markets on a store-by-store basis. Along with the demographic reports, the Company evaluated historical store financial results, store lease obligations, store
floor plans, and locations previously identified by former CSK management as projected closures. This detailed assessment resulted in the identification of an additional 18 CSK locations for closure, five of which were closed by the end of 2009. The
employee separation costs include anticipated payments, as required under various pre-existing employment arrangements with CSK employees at the time of acquisition, relating to the planned involuntarily termination of employees performing
overlapping or duplicative functions. Administrative and distribution facility exit liabilities include costs to close a distribution center in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, which overlapped an existing O’Reilly distribution center and costs to
close small distribution facilities located in Washington and California, which will not be utilized under O’Reilly’s distribution model. In addition, the administrative and distribution exit liabilities include costs to exit certain
administrative office space at CSK’s headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, as functions performed at these locations will be transitioned to the Company’s Springfield, Missouri, headquarters location. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had
finalized all exit plans.

The CSK senior credit facility and term loan facility required repayment upon merger or acquisition and the entire
amounts outstanding under both facilities were repaid by the Company on the July 11, 2008, acquisition date. The excess of the final purchase price over the estimated fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill in the amount of $694,987,000 was recorded in the final purchase price allocations and is not amortizable for tax purposes.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information

The following pro forma financial information
presents the combined historical results of the combined Company as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the respective period (in thousands, except per share data):

This pro forma information is not intended to represent or be
indicative of actual results had the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the period, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results and does not reflect potential synergies, integration costs, or other such costs or savings. Certain pro
forma adjustments have been made to net income to give effect to: estimated charges to conform CSK’s method of accounting for inventory to LIFO, adjustments to selling, general and administrative expenses to remove the amortization on
eliminated CSK historical identifiable intangible assets and deferred liabilities, expenses to amortize the value of identified intangibles acquired in the acquisition (primarily trade names, trademarks and leases), rent and depreciation adjustments
to reflect O’Reilly’s purchase of properties under its synthetic lease facility, adjustments to interest expense to reflect the elimination of preexisting O’Reilly and CSK debt, estimated interest expense on O’Reilly’s new
asset-based credit facility and other minor adjustments. The pro forma information presented above for the year ended December 31, 2008, includes certain acquisition related charges, net of tax, incurred in 2008 of $4,402,000, $2,552,000, and
$5,727,000 for debt prepayment costs, interim facility commitment fees, and the acceleration of CSK’s stock options and restricted stock as a result of the change in control, respectively.

NOTE 3 – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill is reviewed annually on December 31 for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in business conditions indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill is not amortizable for financial statement purposes. During the
year ended December 31, 2009,



the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $23,805,000, primarily due to changes in purchase price
allocation in connection with the acquisition of CSK, which was finalized on June 30, 2009, (see Note 2). For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded amortization expense of $14,097,000, $9,166,000, and
$199,000, respectively, related to amortizable intangible assets, which are included in “Other assets” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The components of the Company’s amortizable and unamortizable intangible assets
were as follows on December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

In addition, the Company has recorded a liability for the values of operating leases with unfavorable terms,
acquired in the acquisition of CSK, totaling approximately $49,570,000 and $49,680,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which are included in the “Other liabilities” section of the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. These leases have an estimated weighted-average useful life of approximately 7.7 years. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized an amortized benefit of $9,166,000 and $3,941,000, respectively, related
to these unfavorable operating leases. None of the liabilities related to unfavorable lease terms relate to stores to be closed as discussed in Note 2.

At December 31, 2009, estimated net amortization of the Company’s intangible assets and liabilities for each of the next five years is as follows (in thousands):

The change in the goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2009,
and December 31, 2008, was as follows (in thousands):



NOTE 4 – LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES

Outstanding long-term debt was as follows on December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, (in thousands):

On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK (see
Note 2), the Company entered into its ABL Credit Agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility arranged by BA, which the Company used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other
transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. The ABL Credit Agreement is comprised of a five-year $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a five-year $125 million first-in-last-out
revolving credit facility (FILO tranche) both of which mature on July 11, 2013. As part of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company has pledged virtually all of its assets as collateral and is subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio
covenant. On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement, under the credit facility was $1.050 billion, of which the Company borrowed $588 million. The Company used borrowings
under the credit facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay the Company’s $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under the Company’s synthetic lease facility. As of
December 31, 2009, the amount of the borrowing base available under the credit facility was $1.196 billion, of which the Company had outstanding borrowings of $679 million. The available borrowings under the credit facility are also reduced by
stand-by letters of credit issued by the Company primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had stand-by letters of credit outstanding in
the amount of $72 million and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under the credit facility was $445 million. As part of the Credit Agreement, the Company has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral and is subject to
an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which the Company complied on December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of the borrowing base available under the credit facility was $1.124 billion, of which the Company
had outstanding borrowings of $614 million. The available borrowings under the credit facility are also reduced by stand-by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $56 million and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under the
credit facility was $454 million. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken; these actions include, but are not limited to, the bulleted items below:

•

termination of credit extensions

•

any outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest could become immediately payable

•

cash collateralization of all letter of credit obligations

•

litigation from lenders

At December 31, 2009, borrowings under the tranche A revolver bore interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.25% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum, with each rate being subject
to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. Borrowings under the FILO tranche bore interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 2.50% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum, with
each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by BA from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time
to time plus 1.25%, subject to adjustment based upon remaining available borrowings. Fees related to unused capacity under the credit facility are assessed at a rate of 0.375% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to
adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, the Company paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect to the credit facility. At December 31, 2008, the
Company had borrowings of $164 million under its facilities, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement, with interest rates ranging from 3.125% to 4.75%. At December 31, 2009, the Company had borrowings of $279 million under
its facilities, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement, with interest rates ranging from 2.50% to 4.50%.

On
July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, and November 24, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions with Branch Banking and Trust Company (“BBT”), BA and SunTrust Bank (“SunTrust”). The Company
entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with its floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $450 million of its debt that is outstanding under its ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of
July 11, 2008. The interest rate swap transaction the Company



entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28,
2009, bringing the total notional amount of swapped debt to $400 million as of December 31, 2009, thus increasing the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates. On January 21, 2010 the Company entered into an interest rate swap
transaction with Barclays in the amount of $50 million, increasing the total notional amount of swapped debt to $450 million as of that date, thus reducing the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company is required to make
certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts, while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to the Company referencing the same notional amount. The interest rate swap
transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of the Company’s debt, which may exist under the ABL Credit Facility plus an applicable margin under the terms of the same credit facility. The
counterparties, transaction dates, effective dates, applicable notional amounts, effective index rates and maturity dates of each of the interest rate swap transactions which existed as of December 31, 2009, are included in the table below:

On July 11, 2008, the Company executed the Third Supplemental Indenture (the ‘Third
Supplemental Indenture”) to the 6


/


%
Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”), in which it agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of the Notes originally issued by CSK pursuant to an Indenture dated as of
December 19, 2005, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 30, 2005, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 27, 2006, (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”) by and
between CSK Auto Corporation, CSK Auto, Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. On December 31, 2008, and effective as of July 11, 2008, the Company entered into the Fourth Supplemental Indenture in order to
correct the definition of Exchange Rate in the Third Supplemental Indenture.

The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances,
into cash and shares of the Company’s common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.50% until maturity on December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, these Notes are exchangeable by
the holder only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued):

•

During any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of the
Company’s common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter;

•

If the Notes have been called for redemption by the Company; or

•

Upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control.

If the Notes are exchanged, the Company will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged and the
Company’s total exchange obligation and, in the event the Company’s total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, shares of the Company’s common stock in respect of that excess. The total
exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 25.97 shares of the Company’s common stock and $60.61 in cash.

The Noteholders may require the Company to repurchase some or all of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture. The Company may redeem some
or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after

December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. The Company intends to redeem the Notes in December of 2010, and plans to fund the redemption with available borrowings under its ABL Credit Facility.



The Company has determined that the share exchange feature and the embedded put and call options within the
Notes will be accounted for as equity instruments and as such, the share exchange feature and the embedded options have not been accounted for as derivatives. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of the Debt with
Conversion and Other Options Topic 470 (“ASC 470”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”), which impacts the accounting associated with its Notes. ASC 470 requires the Company
to recognize interest expense, including non-cash interest, based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature, which the Company determined to be 5.93%. In accordance with ASC 470, the liability component of the
exchangeable debt was measured as of the acquisition date, using a 5.93% interest rate and an assumed 2.43-year life, as determined by the first date the holders may require the Company redeem the Note. The difference between the fair value of the
Notes at acquisition date and the fair value of the liability component on that date and December 31, 2009, was $2,100,000, which was assigned to equity. The carrying amount of the equity portion of the Notes was $2,100,000 at December 31,
2009, and is fixed until the Notes are settled. The principal amount of the Notes as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $100,000,000. The unamortized premium on the Notes was $718,000 and $3,568,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, which would be amortized over a period of approximately 0.96 and 1.96 years, respectively, resulting in a net carrying amount of the Notes as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, of $100,718,000 and $103,568,000, respectively. As of
December 31, 2009, the if-converted value of the Notes was $100,037,000; however, as of December 31, 2008, the exchange value of the Notes did not exceed their principal amount. The net interest expense related to the Notes for the year
ended December 31, 2009, was $5,999,000, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6.0%. The net interest expense related to the Notes for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $2,892,000, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6.0%.
The incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2009. The incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were not included in the
diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the impact would have been antidilutive. The retrospective accounting impact the adoption of ASC 470 had on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2008, was not material.

The Company leases certain equipment under capital lease agreements. The lease agreements have
terms ranging from 47 to 180 months, expiring on dates ranging from February 2010 to March 2017. The present value of the future minimum lease payments under capital leases totaled approximately $10,455,000 and $12,997,000 at December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively, which have been classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company acquired additional equipment under capital leases in the amount of $8,337,000 during the period ended
December 31, 2009. The Company assumed capital lease liabilities totaling $13,022,000 in its acquisition of CSK; in addition, the Company acquired additional equipment under capital leases in the amount of $4,847,000 during the period ended
December 31, 2008.

The Company assumed certain building capital leases, which have lease agreements with terms ranging from 58 to 302
months, expiring on dates ranging from October 2010 to April 2015. The present value of future minimum lease payments under building capital leases totaled approximately $775,000 and $1,930,000 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which
have been classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company did not acquire any building capital leases during the period ended December 31, 2009. The Company assumed building capital lease
liabilities totaling $2,190,000 in its acquisition of CSK during the period ended December 31, 2008.

Principal maturities of long-term
debt and capital lease obligations are as follows (in thousands):

NOTE 5 – RELATED PARTIES

The Company leases certain land and buildings related to 48 of its O’Reilly Auto Parts stores under fifteen-year operating lease agreements with
O’Reilly Investment Company and O’Reilly Real Estate Company, partnerships in which certain shareholders and directors of the Company are partners. Generally, these lease agreements provide for renewal options for an additional five years
at the option of the Company and the lease agreements are periodically modified to further extend the lease term for specific stores under the agreement. Additionally, the Company leases certain land and buildings related to 21 of its O’Reilly
Auto Parts stores under fifteen-year operating lease agreements with O’Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC, which is owned by certain shareholders and directors of the



Company. Generally, these lease agreements provide for renewal options for two additional five-year terms at
the option of the Company (see Note 6). Rent payments under these operating leases totaled $3,661,000, $3,542,000 and $3,446,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

NOTE 6 – COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

On September 28, 2007, the Company completed a second amended and restated master agreement to its $49,137,000 Synthetic Operating Lease Facility with a
group of financial institutions. The terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years, a residual value guarantee of approximately $39,700,000 at December 31, 2007, and purchase options on the properties. The
lease facility also contained a provision for an event of default whereby the lessor, among other things, may require the Company to purchase any or all of the properties. The second amended and restated Facility had been accounted for as an
operating lease. On July 11, 2008, the Company, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, purchased all the properties included in its Synthetic Operating Lease Facility for the amount of $49,273,000, thus terminating the facility. The
purchase was funded through borrowings under a new asset-based revolving credit facility (See Note 2 and Note 4).

The Company also leases
certain office space, retail stores, property and equipment under long-term, noncancelable operating leases. Most of these leases include renewal options and some include options to purchase and provisions for percentage rent based on sales. At
December 31, 2009, future minimum rental payments under all of the Company’s operating leases for each of the next five years and in the aggregate are as follows (in thousands):

Rental expense amounted to $226,049,000, $142,363,000 and $55,358,000
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Other Commitments

The Company had construction commitments, which totaled approximately $102,556,000, at December 31, 2009.

NOTE 7 – EXIT ACTIVITIES

The Company
maintains reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. The Company accrues for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of
the remaining noncancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease
terms, which currently extend through April 2023. The Company estimates sublease income and future cash flows based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, the Company’s previous
efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual contracted exit costs, which vary from original estimates. Adjustments
are made for material changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known.

As discussed more fully in Note 2, in
connection with the acquisition of CSK, the Company recorded $14,828,000 of exit costs associated with the planned closure of 51 CSK stores, assumed CSK’s existing closed stores liabilities of $3,650,000 related to 127 locations that were
closed prior to the Company’s acquisition of CSK, recorded $8,866,000 of exit costs associated with the planned closure of CSK administrative office and certain distribution facilities and recorded $26,617,000 of employee separation costs.
These activities have been accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.



The following is a summary of closure reserves for stores, administrative office and distribution facilities
and reserves for employee separation costs at December 31, 2009, and 2008 (in thousands):

NOTE 8 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

As discussed in Note 4 on each of July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, and November 24, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap
transactions with BBT, BA and SunTrust to mitigate cash flow risk associated with the floating interest rate based on the one month LIBOR rate on an aggregate of $450 million of the debt outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of
July 11, 2008. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009, bringing out total notional amount to $400 million as of December 31,
2009, thus increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates. The swap transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges with interest payments designed to offset the interest payments for borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement that
correspond to notional amounts of the swaps. The fair value of the Company’s outstanding hedges are recorded as a liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Changes in fair market value are
recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and any changes resulting from ineffectiveness of the hedge transactions would be recorded in current earnings. The Company’s hedging instruments have been deemed to be highly effective as of
December 31, 2009. The fair value of the swap transactions for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were a payable of $13.1 million ($8.0 million net of tax) and $18.9 million ($11.5 million net of tax), respectively. The net amount
is included as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss”.

The table below represents the amount recorded on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as being a payable to counterparties at December 31 (in thousands):

NOTE 9 – FAIR VALUE
MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure the fair value of certain of its
financial instruments. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:

•

Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in
which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

•

Level 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as
of the reporting date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value,
volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the
instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.

•

Level 3 – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with
internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant.

The fair value of the interest rate swap transactions are based on the discounted net present value of the swap using third party quotes (level 2). Changes in fair market value are recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss), and changes resulting from ineffectiveness are recorded in current earnings.

Assets and liabilities measured at
fair value are based on one or more of three valuation techniques. The three valuation techniques are identified in the table below and are as follows:

a)

Market approach – prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities

b)

Cost approach – amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost)

c)

Income approach – techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing
and excess earnings models)



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows (in thousands):

The estimated fair values of the
Company’s financial instruments, which are determined by reference to quoted market prices, where available, or are based on comparisons to similar instruments of comparable maturities, are as follows (in thousands):

The Company has determined that the
estimated fair value of its asset-based revolving credit facility approximates the carrying amount of $678,800,000. The valuation was determined by consulting investment bankers, the Company’s observations of the value tendered by
counterparties moving into and out of the facility and an analysis of the changes in credit spreads over the previous twelve months for comparable companies in the industry.

NOTE 10 – ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

Unrealized holding gains on
available-for-sale securities, consisting of the Company’s investment in CSK common stock prior to the Company’s completion of the acquisition of CSK, as well as unrealized losses from interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges
are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2009, totaled $5,821,000 with a corresponding tax liability of $2,270,000 resulting in a net
of tax effect of $3,551,000. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaled $7,974,000 with a corresponding tax liability of $3,261,000 resulting in a net of tax effect of $4,713,000.

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2007, December 31, 2008, and
December 31, 2009, consisted of the following (in thousands):

Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007,
was $311,049,000 $181,519,000 and $187,188,000, respectively.



NOTE 11 — SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the time of the grant. Share-based payments include stock
option awards issued under the Company’s employee stock option plan, director stock option plan, stock issued through the Company’s employee stock purchase plan and stock awarded to employees through other benefit programs.

Stock Options

The Company’s employee
stock-based incentive plans provides for the granting of stock options to certain key employees of the Company for the purchase of common stock of the Company. A total of 34,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under these plans. Options
are granted at an exercise price that is equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under the plans expire after ten years and typically vest 25% a year, over four years. The
Company records compensation expense for the grant date fair value of option awards evenly over the vesting period under the straight-line method. A summary of the shares subject to currently issued and outstanding stock options under these plans
are as follows:

The Company maintains a stock based incentive plan for non-employee
directors of the Company pursuant to which the Company may grant stock options. Up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under this plan. Options are granted at an exercise price that is equal to the market value of
the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under the plan expire after seven years and vest fully after six months. The Company records compensation expense for the grant date fair value of option awards evenly over
the vesting period under the straight-line method. A summary of the shares subject to currently issued and outstanding stock options under this plan is as follows:

At December 31, 2009, approximately 9,691,000 and 310,000 shares
were available for future grants under the employee stock option plan and director stock option plan, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized stock option compensation expense related to these plans of
$13,451,000 and a corresponding income tax benefit of $5,246,000. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized stock option compensation expense related to these plans of $7,991,000 and a corresponding income tax benefit of
$3,072,000. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized stock option compensation expense related to these plans of $4,882,000 and a corresponding income tax benefit of $1,801,000.



The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, the risk free rate and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of the
Company’s stock. Expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses historical data and experience to estimate the expected life of options granted. The risk free interest rates for
periods within the contractual life of the options are based on the United States Treasury rates in effect at the time the options are granted for the options’ expected life.

The following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants issued for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

The weighted-average
grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, were $11.10, $7.01 and $11.81, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007 were $30,039,000, $6,578,000 and $19,511,000, respectively. The Company recorded cash received from the exercise of stock options of $54,346,000, $18,625,000 and $17,124,000, in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards at December 31, 2009, was $37,113,000 and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 2.62 years. The weighted-average
remaining contractual life of options currently exercisable at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was 5.21, 4.90 and 4.96 years, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s employee stock purchase plan permits all eligible employees to purchase shares
of the Company’s common stock at 85% of the fair market value. Participants may authorize the Company to withhold up to 5% of their annual salary to participate in the plan. The stock purchase plan authorizes up to 4,250,000 shares to be
granted. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued 178,523 shares under the purchase plan at a weighted average price of $30.47 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company issued 208,293 shares under
the purchase plan at a weighted average price of $22.61 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company issued 156,466 shares under the purchase plan at a weighted average price of $29.12 per share. Compensation expense is
recognized based on the discount between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price for shares sold to employees. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded $959,000 of compensation cost related to employee
share purchases and a corresponding income tax benefit of $374,000. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded $831,000 of compensation cost related to employee share purchases and a corresponding income tax benefit of
$319,000. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded $804,000 of compensation cost related to employee share purchases and a corresponding income tax benefit of $290,000. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,453,000
shares were reserved for future issuance.

Other Employee Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors a contributory profit sharing and savings plan that covers substantially all employees who are at least 21 years of age and have at least six months of service. The Company has agreed
to make matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 2% of each employee’s wages that are contributed and 25% of the next 4% of each employee’s wages that are contributed. The Company may also make additional discretionary profit
sharing contributions to the plan on an annual basis as determined by the Board of Directors. Prior to September 30, 2009, the Company’s matching and profit sharing contributions under this plan were funded in the form of shares of the
Company’s common stock. Since September 30, 2009, the Company’s matching and discretionary profit sharing contributions under this plan have been funded in cash. A total of 4,200,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for
issuance under this plan. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded $6,832,000 of compensation cost for contributions to this plan and a corresponding income tax benefit of $2,664,000. During the year ended December 31,
2008, the Company recorded $4,159,000 of compensation cost for contributions to this plan and a corresponding income tax benefit of $1,599,000. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded $6,849,000 of compensation cost for
contributions to this plan and a corresponding income tax benefit of $2,527,000. The Company issued 193,127 shares in 2009 to fund matching contributions at an average grant date fair value of $35.37. The Company issued 321,162 shares in 2008 to
fund the 2007 profit sharing and matching contributions at an average grant date fair value of $26.72. The Company issued 197,431 shares in 2007 to fund the 2006 profit sharing and matching contributions at an average grant date fair value of
$32.90. A portion of these shares related to profit sharing contributions accrued in prior periods. At December 31, 2009, approximately 349,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under this plan; however, the Company does not anticipate
funding this plan with the issuance of shares in the future.



On July 11, 2008, in conjunction with the acquisition of CSK, the Company became the sponsor for a
401(k) plan that is available to all CSK team members who are at least 21 years of age. The Company matches from 40% to 60% of participant contributions in 10% increments, based on years of service, up to 4% of the participant’s base salary.
The Company matching contributions vest after one year of plan participation or three years of Company service. The Company’s matching contributions from the July 11, 2008, acquisition date through December 31, 2008, totaled $889,000.
The CSK 401(k) plan was merged with the Company’s profit sharing and savings plan effective January 1, 2009.

The Company has in
effect a performance incentive plan for the Company’s senior management under which the Company awards shares of restricted stock that vest equally over a three-year period and are held in escrow until such vesting has occurred. Shares are
forfeited when an employee ceases employment. A total of 650,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under this plan. Shares awarded under this plan are valued based on the market price of the Company’s common stock on the
date of grant and compensation cost is recorded over the vesting period. The Company recorded $544,000 of compensation cost for this plan for the year ended December 31, 2009, and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit of $212,000. The
Company recorded $494,000 of compensation cost for this plan for the year ended December 31, 2008, and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit of $190,000. The Company recorded $459,000 of compensation cost for this plan for the year
ended December 31, 2007, and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit of $169,000. The total fair value of shares vested (at vest date) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, were $657,000, $497,000 and $478,000,
respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards at December 31, 2009, was $618,000. The Company awarded 21,773 shares under this plan in 2009 with an average grant date fair value of $33.36. The Company
awarded 16,830 shares under this plan in 2008 with an average grant date fair value of $26.96. The Company awarded 16,189 shares under this plan in 2007 with an average grant date fair value of $34.02. Compensation cost for shares awarded is
recognized over the three-year vesting period. Changes in the Company’s restricted stock for the year ended December 31, 2009, were as follows:

At December 31, 2009,
approximately 458,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under this plan.

Supplemental Retirement Plan Agreement

In conjunction with the CSK acquisition on July 11, 2008, the Company assumed a supplemental executive retirement plan agreement with CSK’s former
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Maynard Jenkins, which provides supplemental retirement benefits for a period of 10 years beginning on the first anniversary of the effective date of termination of his employment. Mr. Jenkins retired
on August 15, 2007. The benefit amount in this agreement is fully vested and payable to Mr. Jenkins at a rate of $600,000 per annum. The Company has accrued the entire present value of this obligation of approximately $4,000,000 as of the
July 11, 2008 acquisition date. Payments of $600,000 were made to Mr. Jenkins in 2009 and payments of $600,000 were made to Mr. Jenkins between July 11, 2008, the acquisition date, and December 31, 2008.



NOTE 12 – INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income per common share (in thousands, except per share data):

Incremental net shares for the
exchange feature of the Notes, (see Note 4), were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2009; however, the incremental net shares for the exchange feature of the Notes were not included in the
diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the impact would have been antidilutive. The Company did not hold the Notes for any portion of the year ended December 31, 2007.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were stock options outstanding, which were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share as the impact of these options would have been antidilutive. The weighted-average exercise price per share for the options was $35.15, $30.27 and $33.00 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
following table summarizes the antidilutive stock options (in thousands):

NOTE 13 – INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes, and also include the tax effect of carry forwards. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows at December 31 (in thousands):

The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in
thousands):

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amounts
computed at the federal statutory rate is as follows (in thousands):

The excess tax benefit associated with the exercise of non-qualified
stock options has been reflected as additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.



As of December 31, 2009, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax
purposes of $51,578,000 (for which a portion are also available for state tax purposes) and general business tax credit carry forwards available for federal and state tax purposes of $2,386,000 and $4,305,000, respectively. The Company also has an
alternative minimum tax credit carry forward for federal tax purposes of $2,510,000. The net operating loss carry forwards generally expire in years ranging from 2021 to 2027, and the tax credits generally expire in years ranging from 2019 to 2028.
The alternative minimum tax credit carry forward does not expire.

As of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company
had recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits (including interest) of $37,600,000, $34,300,000 and $19,700,000, respectively, of which $37,600,000, $34,300,000 and $19,700,000 would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized,
generally net of federal tax affect. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company had accrued approximately
$4,030,000, $3,900,000 and $2,748,000, respectively, of interest related to uncertain tax positions before the benefit of the deduction for interest on state and federal returns. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
Company recorded tax expense related to an increase in its liability for interest of $1,521,000, $1,429,000 and $1,289,000, respectively. Although unrecognized tax benefits for individual tax positions may increase or decrease during 2010, the
Company expects a reduction of $3,465,000 of unrecognized tax benefits during the one-year period subsequent to December 31, 2009, resulting from settlement or expiration of the statute of limitations.

The O’Reilly U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years 2006 and beyond remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”). The IRS concluded an examination of the O’Reilly consolidated 2006 and 2007 federal income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2009. The statute of limitations for the O’Reilly federal income tax returns for tax years
2005 and prior have expired. The statute of limitations for the O’Reilly U.S. federal income tax return for 2006 will expire on September 15, 2010, unless otherwise extended. The IRS is currently conducting an examination of the
O’Reilly consolidated return for the tax year 2008. The O’Reilly state income tax returns remain subject to examination by various state authorities for tax years ranging from 2001 through 2008.

CSK has had net operating losses in various years dating back to the tax year 1993. For CSK, the statute of limitation for a particular tax year for
examination by the IRS is three years subsequent to the last year in which the loss carryover is finally used. The IRS completed an examination of the CSK consolidated federal tax return for the fiscal years ended January 30,
2005, January 29, 2006, February 4, 2007, and February 2, 2008. The statute of limitation for a particular tax year for examination by various states is generally three to four years subsequent to the last year in which the
loss carryover is finally used.

A summary of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties,
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, is shown below (in thousands):

NOTE 14 – LEGAL MATTERS

O’Reilly Litigation

O’Reilly is currently involved in litigation
incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business. Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period. In addition, O’Reilly is involved in resolving the governmental investigations that were being
conducted against CSK prior to its acquisition by O’Reilly.

CSK Pre-Acquisition Matters – Governmental Investigations and
Actions

As previously reported, the pre-acquisition SEC investigation of CSK, which commenced in 2006, was settled in May 2009 by
administrative order without fines, disgorgement or other financial remedies. However, the DOJ’s criminal investigation into these same matters remains ongoing. In addition, the previously reported SEC complaint against four (4) former
employees of CSK for alleged conduct related to CSK’s historical accounting practices remains ongoing, though one of those former employees died in January, 2010. The action filed by the SEC on July 22, 2009 against Maynard L. Jenkins, the
former chief executive officer of CSK seeking reimbursement from Mr. Jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act



of 2002, as previously reported, also continues. The previously reported DOJ criminal complaint against two
(2) of the former employees of CSK remains ongoing. However, given the recent death of one (1) of those former employees, we expect no further action with respect to such former employee.

With respect to the ongoing DOJ investigation discussed above, attorneys from the DOJ have indicated that as a result of conduct alleged against the former
employees, as set forth in the pleadings in United States vs. Fraser, et. al., U.S.Dist.Ct., Dist. of Ariz.; Case No: 2:09-cr-00372-SRB-2, the DOJ is considering whether to file criminal charges against CSK. O’Reilly is engaged in discussions
with the DOJ to attempt to resolve the matter. O’Reilly cannot predict the outcome of these discussions at this time. O’Reilly intends to vigorously defend against any such charges if filed. The probability of criminal charges being filed
against CSK or the magnitude of the costs to resolve these issues cannot now be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements do not reflect an accrued liability for this contingency.

Several of CSK’s former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed as part of or become the subject of
criminal, administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits. As described above, certain former employees of CSK are the subject of civil and criminal litigation commenced by the government. Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK
entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and O’Reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters. Some of these indemnification
obligations and other related costs may not be covered by CSK’s insurance policies.

As a result of the CSK acquisition, O’Reilly
expects to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to the ongoing DOJ investigation of CSK and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced by the DOJ and SEC of CSK’s former employees. O’Reilly recorded an assumed
liability for such fees in the Company’s allocation of purchase price of CSK, of which $20,682,000 remains accrued as of December 31, 2009. O’Reilly has paid approximately $3,978,000 of such legal costs related to the government
investigations and indemnity obligations in 2009.

The foregoing governmental investigations and indemnification matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and, given their complexity and scope, their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time. It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company’s results of operations and cash flow could be materially
affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of such matters, depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. However, at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all of such regulatory
proceedings that are pending, after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits not contemplated in recorded reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 15 – SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

On May 7, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan whereby one right was distributed for each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company held by stockholders of record (the “Rights”) as of the close of business on May 31, 2002. The Rights initially entitle stockholders to buy a unit representing one one-hundredth of a share of a new
series of preferred stock of the Company for $160 and expire on May 30, 2012. The Rights generally will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s common stock or commences a
tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own 15% or more of the Company’s common stock. If a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s common stock,
each Right (other than Rights held by the acquiror) will, unless the Rights are redeemed by the Company, become exercisable upon payment of the exercise price of $160 for an amount of common stock of the Company having a market value of twice the
exercise price of the Right. A copy of the Rights Agreement was filed on June 3, 2002, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as Exhibit 4.2 to the Company’s report on Form 8-K.

Controls and Procedures

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, under the
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report



are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by
us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS

On
July 11, 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of CSK, at which time CSK became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company considers the transaction material to results of operations, cash flows and financial position from the
date of the acquisition through December 31, 2009.

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and members of our board of directors; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in their report, which is included above.
