                                     PART I
Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. is one of the largest  specialty  retailers  of
automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the
United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ("DIY") customers and
professional  installers.  At  December  31,  2002,  we  operated  981 stores in
Alabama, Arkansas,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi,  Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee
and Texas.  Eighteen,  net additional stores were acquired in December 2002, and
will be included in 2003 as new stores.  Our stores carry an  extensive  product
line consisting of:

o    new  and  remanufactured   automotive  hard  parts,  such  as  alternators,
     starters,  fuel pumps, water pumps, brake shoes and pads, chassis parts and
     engine parts;

o    maintenance items, such as oil,  antifreeze,  fluids,  engine additives and
     appearance products;

o    accessories, such as floor mats and seat covers; and

o    a complete line of autobody paint and related  materials,  automotive tools
     and professional service equipment.

     We do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations.

     We were  founded  in 1957 by Charles F.  O'Reilly  and his son,  Charles H.
"Chub" O'Reilly,  Sr. and initially operated from a single store in Springfield,
Missouri. The O'Reilly family has managed the Company since our inception.

     Our goal is to continue  to achieve  growth in sales and  profitability  by
capitalizing  on  our  competitive  advantages  and  executing  our  growth  and
expansion strategies.

     See "Risk Factors"  beginning on page 11 for a description of certain risks
relevant to our  business.  These risk  factors  include,  among  others,  risks
related  to  competition  in the  automotive  aftermarket  business,  our growth
strategy,  our acquisition  strategy,  our sensitivity to regional  economic and
weather  conditions,  our  dependence  upon  key  and  other  personnel  and the
significant voting control held by our principal shareholders.



Competitive Advantages

     Proven  Ability to Execute  Dual Market  Strategy.  We have an  established
track record of serving  both DIY  customers  and  professional  installers.  We
believe  our  ability  to  execute  a  dual  market  strategy  is a  competitive
advantage, which enables us to:

o    target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts;

o    capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure;

o    profitably  operate  both in  large  markets  and  less  densely  populated
     geographic areas which typically attract fewer competitors; and

o    enhance  service  levels  offered to our DIY  customers by offering a broad
     selection of stock keeping units ("SKUs") and extensive  product  knowledge
     required by professional installers.

     We have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years.  For
2002, we derived  approximately  54% of our product sales from our DIY customers
and approximately 46% from our professional installer customers.  As a result of
our  historical  success in executing our dual market  strategy and our over 135
full-time sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer,   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market.

     Superior  Customer  Service.  We seek to attract  new DIY and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service, the key elements of which include:

o    superior in-store service through highly-motivated,  technically proficient
     store personnel  ("Professional Parts People") using advanced point-of-sale
     systems;

o    an extensive selection of products;

o    attractive stores in convenient locations; and

o    competitive pricing, with a low price guarantee.

     Technically  Proficient  Professional  Parts People.  Our highly proficient
Professional Parts People provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage,
particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional
Parts People to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve
the  technically-oriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis.  Such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our DIY customers,  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our Professional Parts People.

     Strategic   Distribution   Systems.   We   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store network in seventeen,  contiguous  states  (Alabama,
Arkansas,   Florida,  Georgia,   Illinois,   Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,
Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi,  Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee
and Texas) and the strategic  locations of our nine distribution  centers enable
us to  maintain  optimum  inventory  levels  throughout  our store  network.  In
addition,  our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link
each of our stores to a distribution  center,  providing for efficient inventory
control and management. Our distribution system provides each of our stores with
same day or overnight  access to  approximately  100,000 SKUs, many of which are
hard to find items not typically  stocked by other parts  retailers.  We believe
the availability of a broad range of products is a key competitive  advantage in
satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.

     Experienced Management Team. Our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan,  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic acquisitions. We have experienced ten consecutive years
of record revenues and earnings growth.  We have a strong senior management team
comprised of 49 professionals  who average 17 years of experience with O'Reilly.
In addition,  our 93 district  managers  average over 9 years of experience with
us.



Growth and Expansion Strategies

     Aggressively  Open New Stores.  We intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new, contiguous markets. We plan to open approximately 130 stores in
2003 and  approximately  145  stores in 2004.  A  majority  of the sites for our
proposed  2003 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2004
store openings have been identified.  In selecting sites for new stores, we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management,  advertising  and
distribution.

     Until 1986, our expansion was targeted to markets with  populations of less
than  100,000.  We entered into a more densely  populated  market in August 1986
with the opening of the first of 29 stores in the greater Kansas City, Missouri,
market area.  Of the 106 net new stores added in 2002, 2 are located in Alabama,
3 in Arkansas,  3 in Georgia,  7 in Illinois,  2 in Kansas, 4 in Kentucky,  7 in
Louisiana, 10 in Mississippi,  7 in Missouri, 20 in Tennessee,  and 41 in Texas.
While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, more aggressive competition
in the  more  densely  populated  markets,  we  believe  that we  have  competed
effectively, and that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively,
in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within
these markets. We also believe that because of our dual market strategy,  we are
better  able to  operate  stores in less  densely  populated  areas  within  our
regional  market which would not otherwise  support a national or regional chain
store selling to one portion of the market or the other. Consequently, we expect
to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas.

     To date,  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to O'Reilly stores. We typically open new
stores  either (i) by  constructing  a new store at a site which is purchased or
leased  and  stocking  the new store with  fixtures  and  inventory,  or (ii) by
acquiring  an  independently  owned parts  store,  typically  by the purchase of
substantially  all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such
store.  Store  sites are  strategically  located in clusters  within  geographic
areas, which complement our distribution system in order to achieve economies of
scale in management,  advertising,  and distribution costs. Other key factors we
consider in the site selection  process  include  population  density and growth
patterns, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, the number and type
of  existing  automotive  repair  facilities,   auto  parts  stores,  and  other
competitors within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such
competitors.  When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale.

     Same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy.   To  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business,   it  is  customer  satisfaction  (whether  of  the  DIY  consumer  or
professional installer), resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability.



     Selectively   Pursue  Strategic   Acquisitions.   Although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented,  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains, such as O'Reilly, to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation.  Thus,  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer.

     Continually Enhance Store Design and Location.  Our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage,  higher ceilings,
more convenient  interior store layouts,  brighter  lighting,  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers,  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service.  We continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design.  We  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network,  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers.

Products and Purchasing

     Our stores offer DIY and professional  installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles,
vans  and  trucks.  We do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations.  Our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized,
well-advertised,  name brand products such as AC Delco,  Moog,  Murray,  Wagner,
Gates Rubber, Federal Mogul, Monroe, Prestone, Quaker State, Pennzoil,  Castrol,
Valvoline, STP, BWD, Cardone, Wix, Armor All and Turtle Wax. In addition to name
brand products,  our stores carry a wide variety of  high-quality  private label
products  under our  O'Reilly  Auto  Parts,  SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Ultima and
Omnispark  proprietary  name brands.  Because most of our private label products
are produced by  nationally  recognized  manufacturers  in  accordance  with our
specifications,  we believe that the private  label  products  are  generally of
equal or, in some cases,  better quality than comparable name brand products,  a
characteristic which is important to our professional  installer  clientele.  We
further  believe that the private label  products are packaged  attractively  to
promote  customer  interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand
products carried in our stores.

     We purchase  automotive  products from approximately 400 vendors,  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 25% of our total purchases in 2002.
Our largest vendor in 2002 accounted for approximately 7% of our total purchases
and the next four largest vendors  accounted for 4-5% of such purchases each. We
have no long-term  contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors, nor
have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory  alternative sources of
supply for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources exist at
substantially  similar costs, for substantially all automotive  products that we
sell.  It is our  policy  to  take  advantage  of  early  payment  and  seasonal
purchasing  discounts  offered by our vendors,  and to utilize  extended  dating
terms  available  from  vendors  due  to  volume  purchasing.  We  consider  our
relationships with our suppliers to be good.



Inflation and Seasonality

     We have  been  successful,  in many  cases,  in  reducing  the  effects  of
merchandise  cost increases  principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive
programs,  economies of scale  resulting from increased  volume of purchases and
selective  forward  buying.  As a result,  we do not believe our operations have
been materially affected by inflation.

     Our business is seasonal to some extent primarily as a result of the impact
of weather  conditions on store sales. Store sales and profits have historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  (April through  September) of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters.

Store Network

     Store Locations.  As a result of our dual market  strategy,  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large,  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas which would not otherwise  support a national or regional chain
selling to just one portion of the automotive  aftermarket.  The following table
sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores:



     Our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   22,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately  6,700 total square feet in size.  At December 31, 2002,  we had a
total of approximately 6.6 million square feet in our 981 stores. Our stores are
served primarily by the nearest distribution center, but also have access to the
broader  selection  of  inventory  available  at one of our 46 Master  Inventory
Stores,   which  on  average  carry   approximately   38,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately 9,400 square feet in size. Master Inventory Stores, in addition to
serving DIY and professional  installer customers in their markets, also provide
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of SKUs on a
same day basis.



     We believe that our stores are  "destination  stores"  generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity.  Consequently,  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares,  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access.

     Store Layout. We utilize a computer-assisted  "plan-o-grammed" store layout
system to provide a uniform and consistent  merchandise  presentation;  however,
some variation occurs in order to meet the specific needs of a particular market
area.  Merchandise  is  arranged  to provide  easy  customer  access and maximum
selling space, keeping high-turnover products and accessories within view of the
customer.  Aisle displays are generally used to feature  high-demand or seasonal
merchandise, new items and advertised specials.

     Store  Automation.  To enhance store level operations and customer service,
we use IBM AS/400  computer  systems in all of our  stores.  These  systems  are
linked  with  the IBM  AS/400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers. Our point-of-sale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make,  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise.  This
system speeds  transaction  times,  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service.   Moreover,   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management,  strategic  planning,  inventory
control and distribution efficiency.

     New Store Site  Selection.  In selecting  sites for new stores,  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management,  advertising and  distribution.  Other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include:

o    population density and growth patterns;

o    age and per capita income;

o    vehicle traffic counts;

o    the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities; and

o    the  number  of  auto  parts   stores  and  other   competitors   within  a
     pre-determined radius and the operational strength of such competitors.

     When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale.  After  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores,  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas. This strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market.



Distribution System

     The  following  table sets  forth the  distribution  centers  we  currently
operate:



     In addition, adjacent to the Springfield,  Missouri distribution center, we
operate  a  36,000  square  foot  bulk   merchandise   warehouse  used  for  the
distribution  of  bulk  products  such  as  motor  oil,  antifreeze,  batteries,
lubricants  and other fast  moving  bulk  products,  and an 20,000  square  foot
returned goods  processing  facility.  We also operate a 31,000 square foot bulk
warehouse in McAllen,  Texas that serves the  surrounding  distribution  centers
with bulk motor oil. A tenth distribution center,  located in Saraland,  Alabama
near  Mobile,  Alabama  with  approximately  301,000  square feet to be used for
distribution  and  approximately  13,000 square feet to be used for offices,  is
under construction and is expected to open June 2003.

     Our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems,  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis.  The  distribution  centers
utilize  computer-assisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores.  In  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores, we have established a  satellite-based  data interchange
system among those stores in which  high-speed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available,  the distribution  center, which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters.

     We  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventory-carrying   costs,   improving  our  store  in-stock   positions,   and
controlling and managing our inventory.  Moreover, we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores,  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas.
Our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center.  As part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network, in 2003 we plan to:

o    open a distribution center in the  Saraland/Mobile,  Alabama area providing
     opportunity for continued expansion in the southeast United States; and

o    continue to implement  improvement plans to increase  inventory turnover in
     all distribution centers; and

o    upgrade  material  handling  equipment  in  several   distribution  centers
     including conveyor systems, forklifts and racking.



Marketing

     Marketing  to the  DIY  Customer.  We  aggressively  promote  sales  to DIY
customers through an extensive  advertising program,  which includes direct mail
and newspaper,  radio and television advertising in selected markets. We believe
that our  advertising  and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant
name recognition in each of our market areas. Newspaper and radio advertisements
are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions, frequently
in connection with specific sale events and promotions.  To promote sales to car
enthusiasts,  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally, we sponsor 16 nationally televised races and
over 200  motorsports  races and car shows at over 150  racetracks in 17 states,
including  the  O'Reilly  Chili Bowl,  the World of Outlaws  Series,  the NASCAR
Craftsmen Truck Series, as well as four National Hotrod Racing Association races
in Topeka,  Memphis,  Houston and Dallas.  O'Reilly  Auto Parts is the "official
auto parts  store" of Texas  Motor  Speedway,  Kansas  Speedway,  Bristol  Motor
Speedway,  Houston Raceway Park, Texas Motorplex,  Memphis  Motorsports Park and
Heartland  Park.  We have found  that the more  progressive  marketing  concepts
utilized  in the DIY  portion of our  business  can also be applied to  increase
sales to our professional installer customers.

     Marketing  to the  Professional  Installer.  We  have  over  135  full-time
O'Reilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve,  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer. Our First Call program, which is
our commitment to the professional  customer,  includes a dedicated sales force,
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer.
Moreover,  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis. Our First Call marketing  strategy,  with respect to professional
installers, emphasizes our ability to offer:

o    prompt delivery using small trucks or vans operated by most of our stores;

o    a separate counter in most of our stores  dedicated  exclusively to serving
     professional installers;

o    trade credit for qualified professional installers;

o    broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing;

o    a  professional  installer  computer  system that connects  directly to our
     inventory system; and

o    seminars concerning topics of interest to professional installers,  such as
     technical updates, safety and general business management.

     Marketing to the Independently  Owned Parts Store. Along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
O'Reilly  stores,  Ozark  Automotive  Distributors,  Inc.  ("Ozark")  also sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an O'Reilly  store.  We generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products,   but  have,  on  occasion,   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by Ozark.  Ozark  operates  its own
separate  marketing program to independently  owned parts stores through a staff
of three.

     Of  the  approximately  230  independently  owned  parts  stores  currently
purchasing  automotive  products from Ozark,  219  participate in the Auto Value
program through Ozark. As a participant in this program,  an independently owned
parts store which meets certain minimum  financial and operational  standards is
permitted to indicate its Auto Value membership  through the display of the Auto
Value logo, which is owned by The Alliance,  Inc.  (formerly known as Auto Value
Associates,  Inc.), a non-profit buying group consisting of approximately  4,500
members as of December 31, 2002, including O'Reilly, engaged in the distribution
or sale  of  automotive  products.  Additionally,  we  provide  advertising  and
promotional  assistance to Auto Value stores purchasing automotive products from
Ozark,  as well as marketing  and sales  support.  In return for a commitment to
purchase  automotive  products from Ozark, we offer  assistance to an Auto Value
independently  owned  parts  store by making  available  computer  software  for
inventory control.


Management Structure

     Each of our  stores  is  staffed  with a  store  manager  and an  assistant
manager, in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet
the specific needs of each store.  Each of our 93 district  managers has general
supervisory  responsibility  for an average of 10.5 stores within such manager's
district.

     Each  district  manager  receives  comprehensive  training on a  bi-monthly
basis, focusing on management techniques,  new product  announcements,  advanced
automotive  systems and our policies and  procedures.  In turn, the  information
covered at such bi-monthly meetings is discussed in full by district managers at
bi-monthly  meetings  with their store  managers.  All  assistant  managers  and
manager  trainees  are  required to  successfully  complete a six-month  manager
training program, which includes classroom and field training, as a prerequisite
to becoming a store manager. This program covers operations extensively, as well
as principles of successful management.  Shortly after becoming a store manager,
all managers  attend a manager  development  program,  at the  corporate  office
headquarters,  which includes 72 hours of classroom training.  Upon returning to
the stores,  managers  are given  continuous  field  training  throughout  their
management experience.

     We provide financial  incentives to our district managers,  store managers,
assistant  managers  and sales  specialists  through an  incentive  compensation
program.  Under our incentive  compensation program, base salary is augmented by
incentive  compensation  based upon the  achievement of sales and  profitability
goals.  We  believe  that  our  incentive   compensation  program  significantly
increases the  motivation  and overall  performance  of our  Professional  Parts
People and our  ability to attract  and retain  qualified  management  and other
personnel.

     Most of our current senior management, district managers and store managers
were promoted to their positions from within the Company.  Our senior management
team averages 17 years of experience with the Company and district managers have
an average length of service with the Company of over 9 years.

Professional Parts People

     We  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  Professional  Parts  People  is
essential in providing  superior service both to DIY and professional  installer
customers.  Each of our Professional  Parts People is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer.
In addition,  we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons,  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts.
We believe  that the ability of our  Professional  Parts  People to provide such
assistance  to  the  DIY  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customer's visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
DIY business.

     We  screen  prospective  employees,  whom we refer to as team  members,  to
identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts
or repairs, or an aptitude for automotive  knowledge.  Each person who becomes a
team member first  participates  in an  intensive  two-day  orientation  program
designed to  introduce  the team member to our culture and his or her job duties
before being assigned specific job  responsibilities.  The successful completion
of additional training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a
parts  specialist  and  thus  able to work at the  parts  counter  of one of our
stores. All new counter people are required to successfully complete a six-month
basic  automotive  systems  training course and are then enrolled in a six-month
advanced  automotive  systems course for certification by the National Institute
for Automotive Service Excellence ("ASE"),  which administers national exams for
various  automotive  specialties and requires ASE certified  specialists to take
recertification exams every five years.



     Each of our stores  participates in our sales specialist  training program.
Under this program,  selected team members  complete two days of extensive sales
call  training  for  business  development,  after which these team members will
spend  one day per week  calling  on  existing  and new  professional  installer
customers.  Additionally, each team member engaged in such sales activities will
participate  in  quarterly  advanced  training  programs  for sales and business
development.

Customer Service

     We seek to provide our customers  with an efficient  and pleasant  in-store
experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products.  We believe that the  satisfaction of DIY and
professional installer customers is substantially  dependent upon our ability to
provide,  in a  timely  fashion,  the  specific  automotive  product  requested.
Accordingly,  each  O'Reilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications.   We
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores,  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.

Pricing

     We believe that a competitive  pricing  policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully.  Product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store.  Most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices,  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing.  Consistent
with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any in-stock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors.

Competition

     We  compete  in both the DIY and  professional  installer  portions  of the
automotive aftermarket. We compete primarily with:

o    national and  regional  retail  automotive  parts chains (such as AutoZone,
     Inc.,  Advance Auto Parts,  CSK Auto Corp. and The Pep Boys-Manny,  Moe and
     Jack, Inc.);

o    independently owned parts stores;

o    wholesalers  or jobber stores (some of which are  associated  with national
     automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA and CarQuest);

o    automobile dealers; and

o    mass  merchandisers that carry automotive  replacement  parts,  maintenance
     items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).

     We compete on the basis of customer  service,  which  includes  merchandise
selection and  availability,  price,  helpfulness  of store  personnel and store
layout and location.



Team Members

     As of December 31,  2002,  we had 11,513  full-time  team members and 2,760
part-time team members,  of whom 10,849 were employed at our stores,  2,494 were
employed at our distribution  centers and 930 were employed at our corporate and
administrative  headquarters.  Our team  members are not subject to a collective
bargaining  agreement.  We consider  our  relations  with our team members to be
excellent,  and strive to promote good relations  with our team members  through
various programs designed for such purposes.

Servicemarks and Trademarks

     We have  registered the  servicemarks  O'Reilly  Automotive,  O'Reilly Auto
Parts,  and Parts Payoff and the trademarks  SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Omnispark,
First  Call,  Ultima,  and  Master  Pro.  Further,  we are  licensed  to use the
registered  trademarks and servicemarks Auto Value and Parts Master owned by The
Alliance  (formerly  Auto Value  Associates)  in  connection  with our marketing
program.  We believe  that our  business  is not  otherwise  dependent  upon any
patent, trademark, servicemark or copyright.

Regulations

     Although subject to various laws and governmental  regulations  relating to
our business, including those related to the environment, we do not believe that
compliance with such laws and  regulations has a material  adverse effect on our
operations.  Further, we are unaware of any failure to comply with any such laws
and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We
can not give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses
in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation.

Internet Address and Access to SEC Filings

     Our Internet address is www.oreillyauto.com.  Interested readers can access
the  Company's  annual  reports  on Form 10-K,  quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q,
current  reports  on Form 8-K,  and any  amendments  to those  reports  filed or
furnished  pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, through the www.sec.gov.  Such reports are generally available
on the day they are filed.  Additionally,  the Company will  furnish  interested
readers upon request and free of charge, a paper copy of such reports.


Risk Factors

     Some of the  information  in this Form 10-K contains and future reports and
press  releases  and  other  public  information  may  contain   forward-looking
statements that involve  substantial risks and  uncertainties.  You can identify
these  statements  by  forward-looking  words such as "may,"  "will,"  "expect,"
"anticipate,"  "believe,"  "estimate,"  and "continue" or similar  words.  These
"forward-looking   statements"  are  made  in  reliance  upon  the  safe  harbor
provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (See Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.) You should read statements that contain these words carefully  because
they: (1) discuss our future expectations; (2) contain projections of our future
results  of  operations  or of  our  financial  condition;  or (3)  state  other
"forward-looking"  information.  We believe it is important to  communicate  our
expectations to our investors.  However,  there may be events in the future that
we are not able to accurately predict or over which we have no control. The risk
factors listed in this section,  as well as any cautionary language in this Form
10-K, are subject to risks,  uncertainties and assumptions,  including,  but not
limited to, competition,  product demand, the market for auto parts, the economy
in general, inflation, consumer debt levels, governmental approvals, our ability
to hire and retain qualified employees, risks associated with the integration of
acquired business,  weather,  terrorist  activities,  war and the threat of war.
Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results described in these
forward-looking  statements.  You  should be aware  that the  occurrence  of the
events  described  in these risk  factors and  elsewhere in this Form 10-K could
have a material adverse effect on our business,  operating results and financial
condition.


The Automotive Aftermarket Business is Highly Competitive

     Both the DIY and professional installer portions of our business are highly
competitive,  particularly  in the more densely  populated  areas that we serve.
Some of our  competitors  are  larger  than we are and  have  greater  financial
resources.  In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. For a list of our
principal  competitors,  see the  "Competition"  section  of Item 1 of this Form
10-K.

We Cannot Assure Future Growth

     We believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future.  Failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock.  Our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather
conditions,  zoning and other issues related to new store site development,  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions.  We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2003 and beyond will be
achieved.  For a  discussion  of our  growth  strategies,  see the  "Growth  and
Expansion Strategies" section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

Acquisitions May Not Lead to Expected Growth

     We expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy.  Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations. For example: (1) we may not be able to continue
to identify suitable  acquisition  candidates or to acquire additional companies
at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; (2) our management's  attention
may be distracted;  (3) we may fail to retain key acquired personnel; (4) we may
assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; and (5) we may not be
able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions,
for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other
benefits.


Sensitivity to Regional Economic and Weather Conditions

     All of our stores are located in the Central and Southern United States. In
particular, approximately 37% of our stores are located in Texas. Therefore, our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions.
Unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales, particularly to DIY
customers.



Dependence Upon Key and Other Personnel

     Our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel,  including David E. O'Reilly,  Lawrence P. O'Reilly,  Ted F. Wise and
Greg L.  Henslee.  One  key  person,  Lawrence  P.  O'Reilly  retired  from  his
operational  duties in February 2003, but will continue to serve on the Board of
Directors.  Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected  by the  loss of the  services  of one or more  of  these  individuals.
Additionally,  our  successful  implementation  and management of our growth and
expansion  strategies  will  depend on our  ability to  continue  to attract and
retain qualified  personnel.  We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue
to attract  such  personnel.  For a further  discussion  of our  management  and
personnel,  see the  "Business"  section of Item 1 and Item 4a of this Form 10-K
and our  Proxy  Statement  on  Schedule  14A  for the  2003  Annual  Meeting  of
Shareholders, a portion of which is incorporated herein.

Significant Voting Control is held by the O'Reilly Family

     As of the date of this  Form 10-K the  O'Reilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  13% of the  outstanding  shares of our common stock. As a result,
the  O'Reilly  family  acting  together  will  continue  to be able to  exercise
significant  voting  control  over the  Company,  including  the election of our
directors and on any other matter being voted on by our shareholders,  including
any merger, sale of assets or other change in control.

Possible Volatility of Our Stock Price

     The stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions.  The
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts' expectations.  Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock.  In addition,
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies.  In the past, following periods of volatility in
the market price of a company's  securities,  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company.  If similar  litigation were
instituted  against us, it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our management's attention and resources,  which could have an adverse effect on
our business.

Shares Eligible for Future Sale

     All of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended,  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule. We cannot predict the effect,  if any, that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time.  Sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock,  or the perception  that such sales might occur,  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.


Item 2.  Properties
- -------------------

     The   following   table   provides   certain   information   regarding  our
administrative  offices and distribution  centers and offices as of December 31,
2002:



     Of the 981 stores that we operated at December  31,  2002,  375 stores were
owned,  536 stores  were  leased  from  unaffiliated  parties and 70 stores were
leased  from  one of two  real  estate  investment  partnerships  and a  limited
liability  corporation  formed by the O'Reilly family.  Leases with unaffiliated
parties generally  provide for payment of a fixed base rent,  payment of certain
tax,  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses,  and an original  term of 10 years,
subject to one or more  renewals at our option.  We have entered  into  separate
master  lease  agreements  with each of the  affiliated  real estate  investment
partnerships for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby.  Such master lease
agreements  expired on December 31, 1998, and were renewed through  December 31,
2004.  We believe  that the lease  agreements  with the  affiliated  real estate
investment  partnerships  are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third
parties.

     We  believe  that  our  present  facilities  are  in  good  condition,  are
adequately insured and together with those under construction,  are suitable and
adequate for the conduct of our current operations.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings
- -------------------------

     The Company  was a defendant  in a lawsuit  entitled  "Coalition  for Level
Playing  Field,  L.L.C.,  et. AL., v.  AutoZone,  Inc.,  et. AL.," in the United
States  District  Court for the Eastern  District of New York. The suit had been
brought by a group of automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers,
who alleged that the defendants, including the Company, were in violation of the
Robinson-Patman Act. The Company settled the case for an undisclosed amount that
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

     The Company is involved in various  other legal  proceedings  incidental to
the conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters,  it does not  currently
believe that, in the aggregate,  they will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated  financial  position,  results of  operations  or cash flows of the
Company.

Item 4. Submission Of Matters To A Vote Of Security Holders
- -----------------------------------------------------------

     No matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders,  through  the
solicitation  of proxies or otherwise,  during the fourth  quarter of the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2002.

of increased  interest expense in the event of increases in short-term rates. If
the  floating  interest  rate were to increase by 100 basis  points (or 1%) from

- ---------------------------------

     Our chief executive  officer and chief financial  officer have reviewed and
evaluated the Company's  disclosure  controls and  procedures as of December 31,
2002.  Based on such  review  and  evaluation,  the  officers  believe  that the
disclosure  controls and procedures are designed  effectively to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion of our financial condition,  results of operations
and  liquidity  and capital  resources  should be read in  conjunction  with our
consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information
included elsewhere in this annual report.

     We are one of the largest  specialty  retailers of  automotive  aftermarket
parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the United States, selling
our  products  to  both   do-it-yourself   ("DIY")  customers  and  professional
installers.  Our stores carry an extensive  product line  consisting  of new and
remanufactured  automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories,  and a
complete  line of auto body paint and related  materials,  automotive  tools and
professional service equipment.

     Beginning in January 2000, we calculate  same-store  product sales based on
the change in product sales for stores open at least one year. We also calculate
same-store  product  sales  based on the change in  product  sales of only those
stores open during both full periods being compared. We calculate the percentage
increase in both  same-store  product sales based on store sales results,  which
exclude  sales of specialty  machinery,  sales by outside  salesmen and sales to
employees.

     Cost of goods sold  consists  primarily of product  costs and warehouse and
distribution  expenses.  Cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales may
be  affected by  variations  in our product  mix,  price  changes in response to
competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs.

     Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expenses consist primarily
of store payroll,  store occupancy,  advertising expenses,  other store expenses
and general and administrative expenses, including salaries and related benefits
of corporate  team  members,  administrative  office  occupancy  expenses,  data
processing, professional expenses and other related expenses.

DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROL

     Our chief executive  officer and chief financial  officer have reviewed and
evaluated the Company's  disclosure  controls and  procedures as of December 31,
2002.  Based on such  review  and  evaluation,  the  officers  believe  that the
disclosure  controls and procedures are designed  effectively to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or  submits  under the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as  amended,  (i) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in
the SEC's rules and forms and that the  information  required to be discussed by
the  Company  in the  reports  that it files and  submits  under the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) is documented and communicated to the
Company's  management,  including the officers,  as  appropriate to allow timely
decisions  regarding required  disclosure.  There were no significant changes in
the Company's  internal  controls or in other  factors that could  significantly
affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation,  including any
corrective  actions  with  regard  to  significant   deficiencies  and  material
weaknesses.

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The  fundamental   objective  of  financial   reporting  is  to  provide  useful
information  that allows a reader to comprehend  the business  activities of our
company. To aid in that  understanding,  management has identified our "critical
accounting  policies."  These  policies  have  the  potential  to  have  a  more
significant  impact  on  our  financial   statements,   either  because  of  the
significance  of the financial  statement item to which they relate,  or because
they  require  judgment  and  estimation  due to  the  uncertainty  involved  in
measuring, at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature.

o    Cost of goods sold - Cost of goods sold  includes  estimates  of  shortages
     that are adjusted upon physical  inventory counts in subsequent periods and
     estimates  of amounts due from vendors for certain  merchandise  allowances
     and rebates. These estimates are consistent with historical experience.

o    Operating,   selling,   general  and  administrative  expense  ("OSG&A") -
     Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expense includes estimates
     for worker's  compensation and other general liability  obligations,  which
     are  partially  based on  estimates of certain  claim costs and  historical
     experience.

o    Credit  operations - Allowance for doubtful  accounts is estimated based on
     historical  loss  ratios and  consistently  have been  within  management's
     expectations.

o    Revenue - We recognize sales upon shipment of the products.

o    Stock-based  compensation  - We have  elected  to use the  intrinsic  value
     method of accounting  for stock options issued under our stock option plans
     and  accordingly  do not record an  expense  for such  stock  options.  For
     purposes  of pro  forma  disclosures  under  the  fair  value  method,  the
     estimated  fair value of the  options  is  amortized  to  expense  over the
     options'  vesting  period.  Our pro forma  information  for the years ended
     December 31, is as follows:

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Results of Operations

     The  following  table  sets  forth  certain  income  statement  data  as  a
percentage of product sales for the years indicated:


2002 Compared to 2001

     Product sales increased $220.4 million, or 20.2% from $1.09 billion in 2001
to $1.31 billion in 2002, due to 106 net  additional  stores opened during 2002,
and a 3.7%  increase in  same-store  product  sales for stores open at least one
year.  We believe  that the  increased  product  sales  achieved by the existing
stores are the result of our offering of a broader selection of products in most
stores,  an increased  promotional and  advertising  effort through a variety of
media  and  localized  promotional  events,  and  continued  improvement  in the
merchandising  and store layouts of most stores.  Also,  our continued  focus on
serving professional installers contributed to increased sales.

     Gross  profit  increased  18.3% from  $467.8  million  (or 42.8% of product
sales)  in 2001 to  $553.4  million  (or 42.2% of  product  sales) in 2002.  The
increase in gross  profit  dollars is primarily  due to increases in sales.  The
decrease  in gross  profit as a percent of  product  sales is  primarily  due to
increased sales to independent  jobbers,  which are at a lower gross margin, and
increased distribution costs at the distribution centers acquired from Mid-State
Automotive Distributors, Inc.

     Operating,  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses increased $61.1
million  from  $354.0  million  (or  32.4% of  product  sales) in 2001 to $415.1
million (or 31.6% of product  sales) in 2002.  The increase in these expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits,
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations. The decrease in OSG&A expenses as
a percent of product sales was primarily due to reductions in payroll,  benefits
and other OSG&A expenses through management's expense control initiatives.

  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     Other expense, net, increased by $215,000 from $7.1 million in 2001 to $7.3
million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased
borrowings under our credit facility and a decrease in interest income.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $40.4  million in 2001 (37.8%
effective  tax rate) to $49.0 million in 2002 (37.4%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to changes in
the mix of business between the states in which we operate.

     Principally  as a result  of the  foregoing,  net  income in 2002 was $82.0
million (or 6.3% of product  sales),  an  increase of $15.6  million (or 23.6%of
product  sales)  from net  income in 2001 of $66.4  million  (or 6.1% of product
sales).

2001 Compared to 2000

     Product sales  increased  $201.7  million,  or 22.7% from $890.4 million in
2000 to $1.09 billion in 2001, primarily due to 121 net additional stores opened
during 2001,  an 8.8%  increase in  same-store  product sales for stores open at
least one year.  We believe that the  increased  product  sales  achieved by the
existing  stores  are the  result  of our  offering  of a broader  selection  of
products in most stores, an increased promotional and advertising effort through
a variety of media and localized  promotional events, and continued  improvement
in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores. Also, our continued focus
on serving professional installers contributed to increased sales.

     Gross  profit  increased  22.2% from  $382.7  million  (or 43.0% of product
sales) in 2000 to $467.8 million (or 42.8% of product sales) in 2001.

     Operating,  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses increased $61.3
million  from  $292.7  million  (or  32.9% of  product  sales) in 2000 to $354.0
million (or 32.4% of product  sales) in 2001.  The increase in these expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits,
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations.

     Other expense, net, increased by $234,000 from $6.9 million in 2000 to $7.1
million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased
debt levels  related to the issuing of $100 million of senior  notes,  partially
offset by lower  interest  expense  on  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit
facility due to lower interest rates.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $31.5  million in 2000 (37.8%
effective  tax rate) to $40.4 million in 2001 (37.8%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase in the dollar  amount was due to the increase of income  before  income
taxes.

     Principally  as a result  of the  foregoing,  net  income in 2001 was $66.4
million (or 6.1% of product  sales),  an  increase of $14.6  million (or 28.3%of
product  sales)  from net  income in 2000 of $51.7  million  (or 5.8% of product
sales).

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Net cash provided by operating activities was $104.5 million in 2002, $50.0
million in 2001 and $5.8  million in 2000.  The  increase  in cash  provided  by
operating  activities  in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to increases in
net income, accounts payable, income taxes payable,  accrued payroll and accrued
benefits and  withholdings,  partially  offset by increases in  receivables  and
inventory.  The  increase  in cash  provided  by  operating  activities  in 2001
compared  to 2000 is  largely  the  result of smaller  increases  in  inventory,
increased  net income and to a lesser  extent,  increased  accrued  benefits and
withholdings.  This  increase in cash  provided by operating  activities in 2001
compared to 2000 was partially offset by the increase in amounts receivable from
vendors and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities.

     Net cash used in investing  activities  was $105.4  million in 2002,  $77.8
million  in 2001  and  $40.5  million  in 2000.  The  increase  in cash  used in
investing  activities  in 2002  was  primarily  due to  increased  purchases  of
property and  equipment.  The increase in cash used in investing  activities  in
2001 was largely due to the purchase of Mid-State, as discussed in Note 2 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  and a significant reduction in the amount of
proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment.

     On December 15, 2000,  we entered  into a $50 million  Synthetic  Operating
Lease Facility ("the  Facility") with a group of financial  institutions.  Under
the Facility,  the Lessor  generally  acquires land to be developed for O'Reilly
Auto  Parts  stores  and funds the  development  thereof  by the  Company as the
Construction Agent and Guarantor.  We subsequently  leases the property from the
Lessor for an initial  term  through  December  15,  2005,  and has an option to
request  two  additional  successive  renewal  periods of five years  each.  The
Facility  provides for a residual  value  guarantee of $41.7 million at December
31, 2002, and purchase  options on the properties.  It also contains  provisions
for an event of default whereby the Lessor,  among other things,  may require us
to purchase  any or all of the  properties.  We are  utilizing  the  Facility to
finance a portion of its store  growth.  Funding  under the Facility at December
31, 2002,  and 2001,  totaled  $49.0  million and $43.0  million,  respectively.
Future minimum rental  commitments  under the Facility have been included in the
table of future minimum annual rental  commitments  below.  Our lessor under the
Facility acts as lessor to numerous other lessees under similar  synthetic lease
arrangements and has no other  operations.  The Company's maximum loss under its
Facility is limited to its $41.7 million  residual  value  guarantee and none of
the  Company's   assets  have  been  pledged  as  collateral  for  the  Lessor's
obligations.

     On December 29, 2000, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction.  Under the
terms of the transaction,  we sold 90 properties,  including land, buildings and
improvements,  for $52.3 million.  The lease, which is being accounted for as an
operating  lease,  provides  for an  initial  lease  term of 21 years and may be
extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional  successive  periods
of five years each.  The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is
being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial
term will be approximately $5.5 million annually and is included in the table of
future minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancelable  operating leases.
Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce  outstanding  borrowings under
our former revolving credit facility.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     On May 16,  2001,  we  completed a $100  million  private  placement of two
series of unsecured  senior notes  ("Senior  Notes").  The Series  2001-A Senior
Notes were issued for $75 million,  are due May 16, 2006,  and bear  interest at
7.72% per year. The Series 2001-B Senior Notes were issued for $25 million,  are
due May 16, 2008, and bears  interest at 7.92% per year.  The private  placement
agreement  allows for a total of $200 million of Senior Notes issuable in series
and is guaranteed by all of our susidiaries.  Proceeds from the transaction were
used  to  reduce  outstanding  borrowings  under  our  former  revolving  credit
facility.

     In August,  2001, we completed a sale-leaseback with  O'Reilly-Wooten  2000
LLC (an entity owned by certain  shareholders  of the Company).  The transaction
closed on September 1, 2001, with a purchase price of approximately $5.6 million
for nine  O'Reilly  Auto Parts  stores and did not result in a material  gain or
loss. The lease,  which has been accounted for as an operating lease,  calls for
an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options.

     Capital expenditures were $102.3 million in 2002, $68.5 million in 2001 and
$82.0 million in 2000. These  expenditures were primarily related to the opening
of new stores,  as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing  stores.  We
either  opened or acquired  106, 203 and 101 net stores in 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.  Eighteen net,  additional  stores were acquired in December 2002,
and will be included in 2003 as new stores.  We remodeled or relocated 27 stores
in 2002, 16 stores in 2001 and 8 stores in 2000. Three new distribution  centers
were  acquired;  two in  October  2001,  located  in  Nashville,  Tennessee  and
Knoxville, Tennessee, and one in October 2000, located in Little Rock, Arkansas.

     Our  continuing  store  expansion  program  requires   significant  capital
expenditures  and working capital  principally for inventory  requirements.  The
costs  associated  with the opening of a new store  (including  the cost of land
acquisition,  improvements,  fixtures,  inventory  and computer  equipment)  are
estimated to average approximately $900,000 to $1.1 million; however, such costs
may be  significantly  reduced where we lease,  rather than purchase,  the store
site.  Although the cost to acquire the business of an independently owned parts
store varies,  depending  primarily upon the amount of inventory and the amount,
if any, of real estate  being  acquired,  we estimate  that the average  cost to
acquire  such a business  and  convert it to one of our stores is  approximately
$400,000.  We plan to finance our expansion  program through cash expected to be
provided from operating  activities and available  borrowings under our existing
credit facilities.

     On July 29, 2002, we completed an unsecured,  three-year  syndicated credit
facility  in  the  amount  of  $150  million  led by  Wells  Fargo  Bank  as the
Administrative Agent replacing a five-year  syndicated credit facility.  The new
credit facility is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and may be increased to
a total of $200 million,  subject to availability of such additional credit from
either  existing banks within the facility or other banks.  The Credit  Facility
bears  interest at LIBOR plus .875%  (2.26% at December 31, 2002) and expires in
July  2005.  At  December  31,  2002,  and 2001,  $90,000,000  and  $61,350,000,
respectively,  of the revolving credit facility were outstanding.  Additionally,
$15  million  of the term loan  under the old  credit  facility  outstanding  at
December 31, 2001,was fully repaid in 2002.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

     Our  contractual  obligations,  including  commitments  for future payments
under   non-cancelable   lease   arrangements   and  short  and  long-term  debt
arrangements,  are summarized  below and are fully disclosed in Notes 6 and 7 to
the consolidated financial statements.


     We believe that our existing cash, short-term investments, cash expected to
be provided by operating activities,  available bank credit facilities and trade
credit will be sufficient  to fund both our short- and  long-term  capital needs
for the foreseeable future.

Inflation and Seasonality

     We succeeded,  in many cases,  in reducing the effects of merchandise  cost
increases   principally  by  taking  advantage  of  vendor  incentive  programs,
economies of scale  resulting from  increased  volume of purchases and selective
forward  buying.  As a result,  we do not believe that our operations  have been
materially affected by inflation.

     Our business is somewhat  seasonal,  primarily as a result of the impact of
weather  conditions  on store sales.  Store sales and profits have  historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  (April through  September) of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters.

Shareholder Rights Plan

     On May 17, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan.
One Right was  distributed  for each share of common  stock,  par value $.01 per
share, of the Company held by stockholders of record as of the close of business
on May  31,  2002.  The  Rights  initially  entitle  stockholders  to buy a unit
representing one  one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock of
the Company for $160 and expire on May 30, 2012.  The Rights  generally  will be
exercisable  only if a person or group acquires  beneficial  ownership of 15% or
more of the Company's  common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon
consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own 15% or more of
the Company's common stock. If a person of group acquires  beneficial  ownership
of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each Right (other than Rights held
by the  acquiror)  will,  unless the Rights are redeemed by the Company,  become
exercisable  upon payment of the exercise  price of $160 for common stock of the
Company  having a market value of twice the exercise  price of the Right. A copy
of the  Stockholder  Rights Plan was filed on May 28, 2002,  with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, as Exhibit 99.1 to our report on Form 8-K.

New Accounting Standards

     In August 2001, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statements
of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 144,  Accounting  for the  Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Asset,  superseding Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of.
SFAS 144 applies to all long-lived assets,  including  discontinued  operations.
SFAS 144 requires that those  long-lived  assets  classified as held for sale be
measured at the lower of carrying amount (cost less accumulated depreciation) or
fair  value  less  costs to sell.  Discontinued  operations  will no  longer  be
measured at net realizable  value or include  amounts for operating  losses that
have not yet  occurred.  SFAS 144 also  broadens the  reporting of  discontinued
operations to include all  components of an entity with  operations  that can be
distinguished  from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated  from the
ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. We do not expect the
adoption of the new  statement  to have a  significant  financial  impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In June,  2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement
No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Under
the new rules,  a liability  for the costs  associated  with an exit or disposal
activity  will be  recognized  when the  liability is incurred as opposed to the
date of an entity's  commitment to an exit plan. The new rules are effective for
exit or disposal  activities  that are initiated  after December 31, 2002. We do
not  expect  the  adoption  of new  rules to have a  significant  impact  on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 148,  Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition and Disclosure,
amending  SFAS 123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation.  SFAS 148 gives
companies  electing to expense employee stock options three methods to do so. In
addition,  the  statement  amends the  disclosure  requirements  to require more
prominent  disclosure  about the method of accounting for  stock-based  employee
compensation  and the  effect of the  method  used on  reported  results in both
annual and interim financial  statements.  We have elected to continue using the
intrinsic  value method of accounting for stock-based  compensation.  Therefore,
the new  statement  will not  have  any  effect  on our  consolidated  financial
position or results of  operations.  See Note 10 to the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements for additional information regarding stock-based compensation.

     In  November  2002,  the  Financial   Accounting   Standards  Board  issued
Interpretation  45,  Guarantor's  Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for
Guarantees.  The  interpretation  elaborates  on the  disclosures  to be made in
interim and annual  financial  statements of a guarantor  about its  obligations
under certain  guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor
is required to recognize,  at the inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the
fair  value  of the  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  a  guarantee.  Initial
recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a
prospective  basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The
disclosure  requirements  are effective  for financial  statements of interim or
annual  periods  ending after December 15, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we did
not have any outstanding guarantees.  Other than subsidiary guarantees of parent
debt as disclosed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     In  January  2003,  the  Financial   Accounting   Standards   Board  issued
Interpretation   46,   Consolidation   of  Variable   Interest   Entities.   The
interpretation  expands upon and strengthens  existing  accounting guidance that
addresses when a company should include in its financial  statements the assets,
liabilities  and activities of another entity.  A variable  interest entity is a
corporation,  partnership,  trust or any other legal structure used for business
purposes  that either (a) does not have equity  investors  with voting rights or
(b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient  financial resources for
the entity to support its  activities.  The  interpretation  requires a variable
interest  entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest  entity's  activities or
is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's  residual returns or both. The
consolidation  requirements of the interpretation  apply immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements
apply to older  entities in the first  fiscal year or interim  period  beginning
after June 15, 2003.  We have  determined  that our Lessor  under the  Synthetic
Lease Facility is a variable  interest  entity under  Interpretation  No. 46 and
that we are the primary  beneficiary.  We are evaluating the various options and
their  related  impact on our  consolidated  financial  position  or  results of
operations.

     During 2002,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  reached a consensus on Issue
No.  02-16,  Accounting  by  a  Customer  (including  a  Reseller)  for  Certain
Consideration   Received  from  a  Vendor."   Under  the  new   guidance,   cash
consideration received from a vendor should be classified as a reduction of cost
of  sales.  If the  consideration  received  represents  a  payment  for  assets
delivered  to  the  vendor,   it  should  be  classified  as  revenue.   If  the
consideration is a reimbursement of a specific,  incremental,  identifiable cost
incurred in selling the vendor's product,  the cost should be characterized as a
reduction of that cost  incurred.  The guidance is effective for fiscal  periods
beginning  after  December  15,  2002.  We do not  expect the  adoption  of this
guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated  financial position or
results of operations.

  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Business

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc.  ("the  Company")  is a specialty  retailer and
supplier of automotive  aftermarket  parts,  tools,  supplies and accessories to
both the "DIY"  customer  and the  professional  installer  throughout  Alabama,
Arkansas,   Florida,  Georgia,   Illinois,   Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi,  Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee
and Texas.

Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned  subsidiaries.  All significant  intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes sales upon shipment of products.

Use of Estimates

     The preparation of the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States  ("GAAP"),
requires  management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Inventory

     Inventory,  which  consists of automotive  hard parts,  maintenance  items,
accessories and tools,  is stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost has been
determined  using the  last-in,  first-out  ("LIFO")  method.  If the  first-in,
first-out  ("FIFO")  method of costing  inventory  had been used by the Company,
inventory would have been $499,501,000 and $442,989,000 as of December 31, 2002,
and 2001, respectively.

Amounts Receivable from Vendors

     Amounts  receivable  from  vendors  consist  primarily  of amounts  due the
Company for changeover merchandise,  rebates and other allowances.  Reserves for
uncollectable  amounts receivable from vendors are provided for in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements and consistently have been within management's
expectations.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Property and Equipment

     Property and  equipment  are carried at cost.  Depreciation  is provided on
straight-line  and  accelerated  methods over the estimated  useful lives of the
assets.  Service lives for property and equipment  generally range from three to
forty  years.  Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  over  the  terms  of the
underlying  leases.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Upon  retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated  depreciation  are eliminated
and the gain or loss, if any, is included in the  determination of net income as
a component of other income (expense). The Company reviews long-lived assets for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

     The Company  capitalizes  interest costs as a component of  construction in
progress,  based on the  weighted-average  rates paid for long-term  borrowings.
Total interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, were $369,000, $324,000 and $1,354,000, respectively.

Income Taxes

     The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using the  liability  method in
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 109.
The  liability  method  provides that  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are
determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and  liabilities  and are  measured  using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

Advertising Costs

     The Company expenses  advertising  costs as incurred.  Advertising  expense
charged to operations  amounted to $14,442,000,  $12,796,000 and $12,150,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Pre-opening Costs

     Costs associated with the opening of new stores, which consist primarily of
payroll and occupancy costs, are charged to operations as incurred.

Stock Option Plans

     The Company has elected to follow  Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No.
25,   Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees   ("APB  25"),  and  related
interpretations  in  accounting  for its  employee  stock  options  because,  as
discussed in Note 10, the alternative fair value  accounting  provided for under
SFAS No. 123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  requires  the use of
option  valuation  models that were not  developed  for use in valuing  employee
stock  options.  Under the  intrinsic  value method in  accordance  with APB 25,
because the exercise  price of the  Company's  stock  options  equals the market
price of the underlying  stock on the date of grant, no compensation  expense is
recognized.

Earnings per Share

     Basic  earnings  per  share is based  on the  weighted-average  outstanding
common  shares.  Diluted  earnings  per  share is based on the  weighted-average
outstanding  shares adjusted for the effect of common stock  equivalents.  Stock
equivalents that could potentially  dilute basic EPS in the future that were not
included  in  the  fully  diluted  computation  because  they  would  have  been
antidilutive  were 577,551 and 664,650 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     The  Company  grants  credit to certain  customers  who meet the  Company's
pre-established  credit  requirements.  Generally,  the Company does not require
security when trade credit is granted to  customers.  Credit losses are provided
for in the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements and consistently  have
been within management's expectations.

     The Company has provided long-term  financing to a company,  through a note
receivable,  for the  construction  of an office building which is leased by the
Company  (see  Note  7).  The  note  receivable,  amounting  to  $1,911,000  and
$1,991,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, bears interest at 6% and
is due in August 2017. These amounts are included in other current assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

     The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments,  including cash,
short-term  investments,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable and long-term
debt, as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets,  approximates
fair value.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made to the 2001  and 2000  consolidated
financial statements in order to conform to the 2002 presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In August 2001, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statements
of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 144,  Accounting  for the  Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Asset,  superseding Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of.
SFAS 144 applies to all long-lived assets,  including  discontinued  operations.
SFAS 144 requires that those  long-lived  assets  classified as held for sale be
measured at the lower of carrying amount (cost less accumulated depreciation) or
fair  value  less  costs to sell.  Discontinued  operations  will no  longer  be
measured at net realizable  value or include  amounts for operating  losses that
have not yet  occurred.  SFAS 144 also  broadens the  reporting of  discontinued
operations to include all  components of an entity with  operations  that can be
distinguished  from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated  from the
ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. The Company does not
expect the adoption of the new statement to have a significant  financial impact
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In June,  2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement
No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Under
the new rules,  a liability  for the costs  associated  with an exit or disposal
activity  will be  recognized  when the  liability is incurred as opposed to the
date of an entity's  commitment to an exit plan. The new rules are effective for
exit or disposal  activities  that are initiated  after  December 31, 2002.  The
Company does not expect the adoption of new rules to have a  significant  impact
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 148,  Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition and Disclosure,
amending  SFAS 123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation.  SFAS 148 gives
companies  electing to expense employee stock options three methods to do so. In
addition,  the  statement  amends the  disclosure  requirements  to require more
prominent  disclosure  about the method of accounting for  stock-based  employee
compensation  and the  effect of the  method  used on  reported  results in both
annual and  interim  financial  statements.  The Company has elected to continue
using the intrinsic  value method of accounting  for  stock-based  compensation.
Therefore,  the  new  statement  will  not  have  any  effect  on the  Company's
consolidated  financial  position or results of  operations.  See Note 10 to the
Consolidated   Financial   Statements  for  additional   information   regarding
stock-based compensation.

     In  November  2002,  the  Financial   Accounting   Standards  Board  issued
Interpretation  45,  Guarantor's  Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for
Guarantees.  The  interpretation  elaborates  on the  disclosures  to be made in
interim and annual  financial  statements of a guarantor  about its  obligations
under certain  guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor
is required to recognize,  at the inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the
fair  value  of the  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  a  guarantee.  Initial
recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a
prospective  basis to guarantees issued or motified after December 31, 2002. The
disclosure  requirements  are effective  for financial  statements of interim or
annual  periods  ending after  December 15, 2002.  As of December 31, 2002,  the
Company did not have an outstanding  guarantees other than subsidiary guarantees
of parent debt as disclosed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     In  January  2003,  the  Financial   Accounting   Standards   Board  issued
Interpretation   46,   Consolidation   of  Variable   Interest   Entities.   The
interpretation  expands upon and strengthens  existing  accounting guidance that
addresses when a company should include in its financial  statements the assets,
liabilities  and activities of another entity.  A variable  interest entity is a
corporation,  partnership,  trust or any other legal structure used for business
purposes  that either (a) does not have equity  investors  with voting rights or
(b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient  financial resources for
the entity to support its  activities.  The  interpretation  requires a variable
interest  entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest  entity's  activities or
is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's  residual returns or both. The
consolidation  requirements of the interpretation  apply immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements
apply to older  entities in the first  fiscal year or interim  period  beginning
after June 15,  2003.  The  Company  has  determined  that its Lessor  under the
Synthetic Lease Facility is a variable interest entity under  Interpretation No.
46 and that the Company is the primary beneficiary.

     During 2002,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  reached a consensus on Issue
No.  02-16,  Accounting  by  a  Customer  (including  a  Reseller)  for  Certain
Consideration   Received  from  a  Vendor."   Under  the  new   guidance,   cash
consideration received from a vendor should be classified as a reduction of cost
of  sales.  If the  consideration  received  represents  a  payment  for  assets
delivered  to  the  vendor,   it  should  be  classified  as  revenue.   If  the
consideration is a reimbursement of a specific,  incremental,  identifiable cost
incurred in selling the vendor's product,  the cost should be characterized as a
reduction of that cost  incurred.  The guidance is effective for fiscal  periods
beginning  after  December 15, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of
this  guidance  to  have a  significant  impact  on our  consolidated  financial
position or results of operations.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On May 17, 2002, the Board of Directors  adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan. One
Right was distributed for each share of common stock,  par value $.01 per share,
of the Company held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on May
31, 2002. The Rights initially  entitle  stockholders to buy a unit representing
one  one-hundredth  of a share of a new series of preferred stock of the Company
for $160 and expire on May 30, 2012.  The Rights  generally  will be exercisable
only if a person or group  acquires  beneficial  ownership of 15% or more of the
Company's common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation
of  which  such  person  or  group  would  beneficially  own  15% or more of the
Company's  common stock. If a person of group acquires  beneficial  ownership of
15% or more of the Company's common stock, each Right (other than Rights held by
the  acquiror)  will,  unless the Rights are  redeemed  by the  Company,  become
exercisable  upon payment of the exercise  price of $160 for common stock of the
Company  having a market value of twice the exercise  price of the Right. A copy
of the  Stockholder  Rights Plan was filed on May 28, 2002,  with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, as Exhibit 99.1 to our report on Form 8-K.

NOTE 2 - ACQUISITION

     On October 1, 2001, the Company  purchased all of the outstanding  stock of
Mid-State Automotive  Distributors,  Inc.  ("Mid-State") for approximately $20.5
million including  acquisition  costs.  Mid-State was a specialty retailer which
supplied   automotive   aftermarket  parts  throughout  certain  states  in  the
southeastern part of the United States.  The acquisition was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations of
Mid-State are included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The pro
forma effect on earnings of the acquisition of Mid-State were not material.

NOTE 3 - SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

     The Company's short-term  investments are classified as  available-for-sale
in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities,"  and are carried at cost,  which  approximates  fair market
value.  At December  31, 2002,  and 2001,  short-term  investments  consisted of
preferred equity securities.

NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTIES

     The Company leases certain land and buildings  related to its O'Reilly Auto
Parts stores under six-year operating lease agreements with O'Reilly  Investment
Company  and  O'Reilly  Real  Estate  Company,  partnerships  in  which  certain
shareholders  of the Company are  partners.  Generally,  these lease  agreements
provide for renewal  options  for an  additional  six years at the option of the
Company.  Additionally, the Company leases certain land and buildings related to
its O'Reilly Auto Parts stores under 15-year  operating  lease  agreements  with
O'Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC, which is owned by certain shareholders of the Company.
Generally, these lease agreements provide for renewal options for two additional
five-year  terms at the option of the Company (see Note 7). Rent  expense  under
these operating  leases totaled  $3,222,000,  $2,894,000 and $2,671,000 in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 5 - NOTE PAYABLE TO BANK

At December 31, 2001, the Company had available  short-term unsecured bank lines
of credit  providing  for maximum  borrowings  of $5  million,  all of which was
outstanding  at December 31, 2001.  The lines of credit,  which expired in 2002,
bore interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% and were full repaid in 2002. Additionally, at
December 31, 2001, the Company had available a short-term  line of credit in the
amount of $25 million,  none of which was  outstanding at December 31, 2001. The
line of credit bore  interest at LIBOR plus  0.75%.  Neither  line of credit was
renewed during 2002.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 6 - LONG-TERM DEBT

     On July 29, 2002, the Company completed an unsecured, three-year syndicated
credit facility  ("Credit  Facility") in the amount of $150 million led by Wells
Fargo Bank as the Administrative  Agent replacing a five-year  syndicated credit
facility.  The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of our  subsidiaries and may
be  increased  to a total  of $200  million,  subject  to  availability  of such
additional credit from either existing banks within the Credit Facility or other
banks. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus .875% (2.26% at December
31, 2002) and expires in July 2005.  At December 31,  2002,  $90,000,000  of the
Credit Facility was outstanding. At December 31, 2001, the Company had available
an unsecured credit facility  providing for maximum  borrowings of $140 million.
The facility was comprised of a revolving credit facility of $125 million, and a
term loan of $15 million.  At December 31, 2001,  $61,350,000  of the  revolving
credit  facility  and $15 million of the term loan was  outstanding.  The credit
facility,  which bore interest at LIBOR plus 0.50%, expired in January 2003. All
borrowings  outstanding under the old credit facility at December 31, 2001, were
fully repaid in 2002.

     On May 16, 2001, the Company  completed a $100 million private placement of
two series of unsecured senior notes ("Senior Notes").  The Series 2001-A Senior
Notes were issued for $75 million,  are due May 16, 2006,  and bear  interest at
7.72% per year. The Series 2001-B Senior Notes were issued for $25 million,  are
due May 16, 2008,  and bear  interest at 7.92% per year.  The private  placement
agreement allows for a total of $200 million of Senior Notes issuable in series.
Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce  outstanding  borrowings under
the Company's former revolving credit facility.

     During 2002 and 2001, the Company leased certain  computer  equipment under
capitalized  leases.  The lease  agreements have three-year  terms expiring from
2003 to 2005.  At  December  31,  2002,  the  monthly  installments  under these
agreements were approximately  $53,000.  The present value of the future minimum
lease payments under these agreements  totaled $549,000 and $427,000 at December
31, 2002, and 2001, respectively, which has been classified as long-term debt in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  During 2002, 2001 and 2000,
the Company purchased $812,000, $467,000 and $800,000,  respectively,  of assets
under capitalized leases.

     Additionally,   the  Company  has  various   unsecured   notes  payable  to
individuals and banks, amounting to $172,000 and $251,000, at December 31, 2002,
and 2001,  respectively.  The average interest rate on these notes is 5.25% with
monthly installments approximate $7,000 including interest.

     Indirect  borrowings  under  letters of credit  provided  by a  $20,000,000
sublimit of the Credit Facility totaled  $6,028,000 and $210,650 at December 31,
2002, and 2001,  respectively.  These letters of credit reduced  availability of
borrowings at December 31, 2002, and 2001.

respectively.

NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

     On December 15,  2000,  the Company  entered  into a $50 million  Synthetic
Operating   Lease   Facility  ("the   Facility")   with  a  group  of  financial
institutions.  Under the  Facility,  the Lessor  generally  acquires  land to be
developed  for O'Reilly Auto Parts stores and funds the  development  thereof by
the Company as the Construction  Agent and Guarantor.  The Company  subsequently
leases the property  from the Lessor for an initial  term  through  December 15,
2005, and has an option to request two additional  successive renewal periods of
five years each. The Facility  provides for a residual value  guarantee of $41.7
million at December 31, 2002, and purchase  options on the  properties.  It also
contains  provisions  for an event of default  whereby the  Lessor,  among other
things,  may require the Company to purchase any or all of the  properties.  The
Company is  utilizing  the  Facility  to finance a portion of its store  growth.
Funding under the Facility at December 31, 2002, and 2001, totaled $49.0 million
and $43.0 million,  respectively.  Future minimum rental  commitments  under the
Facility  have  been  included  in the  table of future  minimum  annual  rental
commitments  below.  The  Company's  lessor under the Facility acts as lessor to
numerous other lessees under similar  synthetic  lease  arrangements  and has no
other  operations.  The Company's  maximum loss under its Facility is limited to
its $41.7 million residual value guarantee and none of the Company's assets have
been pledged as collateral for the Lessor's obligations.

     On December 29, 2000, the Company  completed a sale-leaseback  transaction.
Under the terms of the  transaction,  the Company sold 90 properties,  including
land,  buildings and improvements,  for $52.3 million. The lease, which is being
accounted  for as an operating  lease,  provides for an initial lease term of 21
years and may be extended  for one initial  ten-year  period and two  additional
successive  periods of five years each.  The resulting  gain of $4.5 million has
been  deferred  and is being  amortized  over the initial  lease term.  Net rent
expense during the initial term will be approximately  $5.5 million annually and
is included in the table of future minimum annual rental  commitments.  Proceeds
from the  transaction  were  used to  reduce  outstanding  borrowings  under the
Company's former revolving credit facility.

NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

     On May 16, 2001, the Company  completed a $100 million private placement of
two series of unsecured senior notes ("Senior Notes").  The Series 2001-A Senior
Notes were issued for $75 million,  are due May 16, 2006,  and bear  interest at
7.72% per year. The Series 2001-B Senior Notes were issued for $25 million,  are
due May 16, 2008,  and bear  interest at 7.92% per year.  The private  placement
agreement allows for a total of $200 million of Senior Notes issuable in series.
Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce  outstanding  borrowings under
the Company's former revolving credit facility.

     In  August,   2001,   the   Company   completed   a   sale-leaseback   with
O'Reilly-Wooten  2000  LLC (an  entity  owned  by  certain  shareholders  of the
Company).  The transaction closed on September 1, 2001, with a purchase price of
approximately  $5.6  million  for nine  O'Reilly  Auto Parts  stores and did not
result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an
operating  lease,  calls for an initial  term of 15 years  with three  five-year
renewal options.

     The Company also leases certain office space,  retail stores,  property and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases. Most of these leases
include  renewal options and some include options to purchase and provisions for
percentage  rent based on sales.  At December 31, 2002,  future  minimum  rental
payments under all of the Company's  operating  leases for each of the next five
years and in the aggregate are as follows (amounts in thousands):



     Rental expense amounted to $29,652,000, $25,122,000 and $16,219,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Other Commitments

     The Company had construction commitments, which totaled approximately $41.1
million, at December 31, 2002.

NOTE 8 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company  was a defendant  in a lawsuit  entitled  "Coalition  for Level
Playing  Field,  L.L.C.,  et. AL., v.  AutoZone,  Inc.,  et. AL.," in the United
States  District  Court for the Eastern  District of New York. The suit had been
brought by a group of automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers,
who alleged that the defendants, including the Company, were in violation of the
Robinson-Patman  Act. The Company  settlled the case for an  undisclosed  amount
that did not have a material impact on the  consolidated  financial  position or
results of operations.

NOTE 8 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)

     The Company is  involved in various  legal  proceedings  incidental  to the
conduct of its  business.  Although the Company  cannot  ascertain the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters,  it does not  currently
believe that, in the aggregate,  they will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated  financial  position,  results of  operations  or cash flows of the
Company.

NOTE 9 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company  sponsors a  contributory  profit sharing and savings plan that
covers  substantially  all  employees  who are 21 years of age with at least six
months  of  service.  Employees  may  contribute  up to  100%  of  their  annual
compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum  limitations.  The Company
has agreed to make matching  contributions  equal to 50% of the first 2% of each
employee's contribution and 25% of the next 4% of each employee's  contribution.
Additional  contributions to the plan may be made as determined  annually by the
Board of  Directors.  After  two years of  service,  Company  contributions  and
earnings thereon vest at the rate of 20% per year. Company contributions charged
to operations amounted to $3,438,000 in 2002,  $3,207,000 in 2001 and $2,454,000
in 2000.  Company  contributions,  in the form of common  stock,  to the  profit
sharing and savings plan to match employee  contributions during the years ended
December 31 were as follows:



     Profit sharing contributions accrued at December 31, and funded in the next
year  through  the  issuance  of shares of the  Company's  common  stock were as
follows:



     The Company also  sponsors a non-funded  non-contributory  defined  benefit
health care plan,  which provides  certain health benefits to qualified  retired
employees.  According to the terms of this plan,  retirees'  annual benefits are
limited to $1,000 per employee  starting at age 66 for employees with 20 or more
years of  service.  Post-retirement  benefit  costs for each of the years  ended
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 amounted to $12,000.

     Additionally,  the Company has  adopted a stock  purchase  plan under which
1,000,000  shares of common stock are reserved  for future  issuance.  Under the
plan,  substantially all employees and non-employee  directors have the right to
purchase shares of the Company's common stock monthly at a price equal to 85% of

NOTE 10 - STOCK OPTION PLANS

     The Company has a stock option plan under which  incentive stock options or
non-qualified  stock  options may be granted to officers and key  employees.  An
aggregate  of 6,000,000  shares of common stock is reserved for future  issuance
under this plan.  The exercise  price of options  granted shall not be less than
the fair  market  value of the stock on the date of grant and the  options  will
expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.  Options granted  pursuant
to the plan become exercisable no sooner than six months from the date of grant.
In the case of a shareholder  owning more than 10% of the  outstanding  stock of
the Company, the exercise price of an incentive option may not be less than 110%
of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.  Also, the aggregate
fair market value of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are
exercisable  for the first time by any  individual  in any calendar year may not
exceed  $100,000.  All  grants  under  the plan  since its  inception  have been
non-qualified  stock option grants. A summary of outstanding stock options under
this plan is as follows:



     Options to purchase  1,566,104,  1,250,261 and  1,729,033  shares of common
stock were exercisable at December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 10 - STOCK OPTION PLANS (CONTINUED)

     The Company also maintains a stock option plan for  non-employee  directors
of the Company  under which  300,000  shares of common  stock are  reserved  for
future issuance.  All director stock options are granted at fair market value on
the date of grant and  expire on the  earlier of  termination  of service to the
Company as a director or seven  years.  Options  granted  under this plan become
exercisable  six months from the date of grant. A summary of  outstanding  stock
options under this plan is as follows:



     All options under this plan were  exercisable  at December 31, 2002,  2001,
and 2000.

     Pro forma  information  regarding  net  income  and  earnings  per share is
required  by SFAS  No.  123,  and has  been  determined  as if the  Company  had
accounted  for its employee and  non-employee  director  stock options under the
fair value method.

     The fair values for these options were estimated at the date of grant using
a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with  the  following  weighted-average
assumptions for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively:  risk-free interest rates of
4.01%,  5.16% and 5.02%;  volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Company's  common stock of .481, .475, and .442; and  weighted-average  expected
life of the  options of 9, 9 and 8.9 years.  The  Company  assumed a 0% dividend
yield over the expected life of the options. The weighted-average fair values of
options  granted during the years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001, and 2000 were
$17.75,  $16.52  and  $9.24,   respectively.   The  weighted-average   remaining
contractual  life at December 31, 2002,  for all  outstanding  options under the
Company's stock option plans is 7.058 years. The weighted-average exercise price
for all  outstanding  options under the Company's stock option plans was $22.78,
$20.63 and $16.12 at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     The  Black-Scholes   option  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded options,  which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.   Because  the   Company's   stock   options  have   characteristics
significantly  different from those of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's opinion, the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

                         Report Of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2002,  and 2001, and the
related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the  three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2002.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  at December 31,  2002,  and 2001,  and the
consolidated  results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
