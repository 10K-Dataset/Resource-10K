                                     PART I
Item 1.  Business

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. is one of the largest  specialty  retailers  of
automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the
United States,  selling our products to both do-it-yourself  (DIY) customers and
professional  installers.  At December  31,  2003,  we operated  1,109 stores in
Alabama, Arkansas,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee,
Texas and Virginia. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of:

o    new  and  remanufactured   automotive  hard  parts,  such  as  alternators,
     starters,  fuel pumps, water pumps, brake shoes and pads, chassis parts and
     engine parts;

o    maintenance items, such as oil,  antifreeze,  fluids,  engine additives and
     appearance products;

o    accessories, such as floor mats and seat covers; and

o    a complete line of autobody paint and related  materials,  automotive tools
     and professional service equipment.

      We do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations.

     We were  founded  in 1957 by Charles F.  O'Reilly  and his son,  Charles H.
"Chub" O'Reilly,  Sr. and initially operated from a single store in Springfield,
Missouri. The O'Reilly family has managed the Company since our inception.

     Our goal is to continue  to achieve  growth in sales and  profitability  by
capitalizing  on  our  competitive  advantages  and  executing  our  growth  and
expansion strategies.

     See "Risk Factors"  beginning on page 12 for a description of certain risks
relevant to our  business.  These risk  factors  include,  among  others,  risks
related  to  competition  in the  automotive  aftermarket  business,  our growth
strategy,  our acquisition  strategy,  our sensitivity to regional  economic and
weather  conditions,  our  dependence  upon  key  and  other  personnel  and the
significant voting control held by our principal shareholders.




Competitive Advantages

     Proven  Ability to Execute  Dual Market  Strategy.  We have an  established
track record of serving  both DIY  customers  and  professional  installers.  We
believe  our  ability  to  execute  a  dual  market  strategy  is a  competitive
advantage, which enables us to:

o    target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts;

o    capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure;

o    profitably  operate  both in  large  markets  and  less  densely  populated
     geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors; and

o    enhance  service  levels  offered to our DIY  customers by offering a broad
     selection of stock  keeping units (SKUs) and  extensive  product  knowledge
     required by professional installers.

     We have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years.  For
2003, we derived  approximately  53% of our product sales from our DIY customers
and approximately 47% from our professional installer customers.  As a result of
our  historical  success  in  executing  our dual  market  strategy  and our 173
full-time sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer,   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market.

     Superior  Customer  Service.  We seek to attract  new DIY and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service, the key elements of which include:

o    superior in-store service through highly-motivated,  technically proficient
     store personnel  (Professional  Parts People) using advanced  point-of-sale
     systems;

o    an extensive selection of products;

o    attractive stores in convenient locations; and

o    competitive pricing, with a low price guarantee.

     Technically  Proficient  Professional  Parts People.  Our highly proficient
Professional Parts People provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage,
particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional
Parts People to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve
the  technically-oriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis.  Such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our DIY customers,  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our Professional Parts People.

     Strategic   Distribution   Systems.   We   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store  network in eighteen,  contiguous  states  (Alabama,
Arkansas,   Florida,  Georgia,   Illinois,   Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee,
Texas and Virginia) and the strategic locations of our ten distribution  centers
enable us to maintain optimum inventory levels throughout our store network.  In
addition,  our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link
each of our stores to a distribution  center,  providing for efficient inventory
control and management. Our distribution system provides each of our stores with
same day or overnight  access to  approximately  100,000 SKUs, many of which are
hard to find items not typically  stocked by other parts  retailers.  We believe
the availability of a broad range of products is a key competitive  advantage in
satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.

     Experienced Management Team. Our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan,  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic  acquisitions.  We have experienced  eleven consecutive
years of record  revenues and earnings growth since becoming a public company in
April  1993.  We  have  a  strong  senior   management   team  comprised  of  57
professionals who average 16 years of experience with O'Reilly. In addition, our
106 district managers average over 9 years of experience with us.




Growth and Expansion Strategies

     Aggressively  Open New Stores.  We intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new, contiguous markets. We plan to open approximately 140 stores in
2004 and  approximately  150  stores in 2005.  A  majority  of the sites for our
proposed  2004 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2005
store openings have been identified.  In selecting sites for new stores, we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management,  advertising  and
distribution.

     We target  both small  (population  less than  100,000)  and large  markets
(population greater than 100,000) for expansion of our store network. Of the 128
net, new stores added in 2003,  25 are located in Alabama,  5 in Arkansas,  3 in
Florida, 9 in Illinois,  1 in Indiana, 1 in Iowa, 2 in Kansas, 10 in Kentucky, 3
in Louisiana,  16 in Mississippi,  2 in Missouri,  15 in North  Carolina,  17 in
Tennessee,  18 in Texas and 1 in  Virginia.  While we have faced,  and expect to
continue to face,  more  aggressive  competition  in the more densely  populated
markets,  we believe  that we have  competed  effectively,  and that we are well
positioned to continue to compete  effectively,  in such markets and achieve our
goal of continued sales and profit growth within these markets.  We also believe
that because of our dual market  strategy,  we are better able to operate stores
in less densely  populated  areas within our  regional  market,  which would not
otherwise  support a national or regional  chain store selling to one portion of
the market or the other. Consequently,  we expect to continue to open new stores
in less densely populated market areas.

     To date,  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to O'Reilly stores. We typically open new
stores either by (i) constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and
stocking  the new store  with  fixtures  and  inventory,  or (ii)  acquiring  an
independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially
all of the inventory  and other assets (other than realty) of such store.  Store
sites are  strategically  located  in  clusters  within  geographic  areas  that
complement  our  distribution  system in order to achieve  economies of scale in
management, advertising and distribution costs. Other key factors we consider in
the site selection process include population  density and growth patterns,  age
and per capita income,  vehicle traffic counts,  the number and type of existing
automotive  repair  facilities,  other  competing  auto parts stores,  and other
competitors within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such
competitors.  When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale.

     Same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy.   To  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business,   it  is  customer  satisfaction  (whether  of  the  DIY  consumer  or
professional installer), resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability.



     Selectively   Pursue  Strategic   Acquisitions.   Although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented,  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains, such as O'Reilly, to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation.  Thus,  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer.

     Continually Enhance Store Design and Location.  Our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage,  higher ceilings,
more convenient  interior store layouts,  brighter  lighting,  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers,  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service.  We continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design.  We  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network,  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers.

Products and Purchasing

     Our stores offer DIY and professional  installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles,
vans  and  trucks.  We do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations.  Our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized,
well-advertised,  name brand products such as AC Delco,  Moog,  Murray,  Wagner,
Gates Rubber, Federal Mogul, Monroe, Prestone, Quaker State, Pennzoil,  Castrol,
Valvoline, STP, BWD, Cardone, Wix, Armor All and Turtle Wax. In addition to name
brand products,  our stores carry a wide variety of  high-quality  private label
products under our O'Reilly Auto Parts,  SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Ultima, Master
Pro and  Omnispark  proprietary  name brands.  Because most of our private label
products are produced by nationally recognized  manufacturers in accordance with
our specifications,  we believe that the private label products are generally of
equal or, in some cases,  better quality than comparable name brand products,  a
characteristic which is important to our professional  installer  clientele.  We
further  believe that the private label  products are packaged  attractively  to
promote  customer  interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand
products carried in our stores.

     We purchase  automotive  products from approximately 400 vendors,  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 38% of our total purchases in 2003.
Our  largest  vendor  in  2003  accounted  for  approximately  15% of our  total
purchases  and the  next  four  largest  vendors  accounted  for  4-11%  of such
purchases each. We have no long-term  contractual  purchase commitments with any
of our vendors,  nor have we  experienced  difficulty in obtaining  satisfactory
alternative  sources of supply for automotive parts. We believe that alternative
supply sources exist at  substantially  similar  costs,  for  substantially  all
automotive  products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment
and  seasonal  purchasing  discounts  offered  by our  vendors,  and to  utilize
extended  dating terms available from vendors due to volume  purchasing.  During
2003,  we entered into various  programs  and  arrangements  with certain of our
vendors  that  provide  for  extended  dating and  payment  terms for  inventory
purchases,  including  pay-on-scan  arrangements.  We consider our relationships
with our suppliers to be good.




Inflation and Seasonality

     We have  been  successful,  in many  cases,  in  reducing  the  effects  of
merchandise  cost increases  principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive
programs,  economies of scale  resulting from increased  volume of purchases and
selective  forward  buying.  As a result,  we do not believe our operations have
been materially affected by inflation.

     Our business is seasonal to some extent primarily as a result of the impact
of weather  conditions on store sales. Store sales and profits have historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  (April through  September) of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters.

Store Network

     Store Locations.  As a result of our dual market  strategy,  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large,  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas that would not otherwise  support a national or regional  chain
selling to just one portion of the automotive  aftermarket.  The following table
sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores:



     Our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   22,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately  6,600 total square feet in size.  At December 31, 2003,  we had a
total of approximately  7.3 million square feet in our 1,109 stores.  Our stores
are served primarily by the nearest distribution center, but also have access to
the broader  selection of inventory  available at one of our 61 Master Inventory
Stores,   which  on  average  carry   approximately   36,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately 8,800 square feet in size. Master Inventory Stores, in addition to
serving DIY and professional installer customers in their markets, also provides
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of SKUs on a
same-day basis.




     We believe that our stores are  "destination  stores"  generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity.  Consequently,  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares,  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access.

     Store Layout. We utilize a computer-assisted  "plan-o-grammed" store layout
system to provide a uniform and consistent  merchandise  presentation;  however,
some variation occurs in order to meet the specific needs of a particular market
area.  Merchandise  is  arranged  to provide  easy  customer  access and maximum
selling space, keeping high-turnover products and accessories within view of the
customer.  Aisle displays are generally used to feature  high-demand or seasonal
merchandise, new items and advertised specials.

     Store  Automation.  To enhance store level operations and customer service,
we use IBM AS/400  computer  systems in all of our  stores.  These  systems  are
linked  with  the IBM  AS/400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers. Our point-of-sale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make,  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise.  This
system speeds  transaction  times,  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service.   Moreover,   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management,  strategic  planning,  inventory
control and distribution efficiency.

     New Store Site  Selection.  In selecting  sites for new stores,  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management,  advertising and  distribution.  Other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include:

o    population density and growth patterns;

o    age and per capita income;

o    vehicle traffic counts;

o    the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities; and

o    the  number  of  auto  parts   stores  and  other   competitors   within  a
     pre-determined radius and the operational strength of such competitors.

     When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale.  After  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores,  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas. This strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market.




Distribution System

     The  following  table sets  forth the  distribution  centers  we  currently
operate:


     In addition, adjacent to the Springfield,  Missouri distribution center, we
operate  a  36,000  square  foot  bulk   merchandise   warehouse  used  for  the
distribution  of  bulk  products  such  as  motor  oil,  antifreeze,  batteries,
lubricants  and other  fast  moving  bulk  products,  and a 20,000  square  foot
returned goods  processing  facility.  We also operate a 31,000 square foot bulk
warehouse in McAllen,  Texas that serves the  surrounding  distribution  centers
with bulk products.

     Our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems,  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis.  The  distribution  centers
utilize  computer-assisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores.  In  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores, we have established a  satellite-based  data interchange
system among those stores in which  high-speed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available,  the distribution  center, which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters.

     We  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventory-carrying   costs,   improving  our  store  in-stock   positions,   and
controlling and managing our inventory.  Moreover, we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores,  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas.
Our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center.  As part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network, in 2004 we plan to:

o    continue to implement  improvement plans to increase  inventory turnover in
     all distribution centers; and

o    upgrade  material  handling  equipment  in  several   distribution  centers
     including conveyor systems, forklifts and racking.




Marketing

     Marketing  to the  DIY  Customer.  We  aggressively  promote  sales  to DIY
customers through an extensive  advertising program,  which includes direct mail
and newspaper,  radio and television advertising in selected markets. We believe
that our  advertising  and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant
name recognition in each of our market areas. Newspaper and radio advertisements
are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions, frequently
in connection with specific sale events and promotions.  To promote sales to car
enthusiasts,  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally, we sponsor 16 nationally televised races and
over 288  motorsports  races and car shows at over 200  facilities in 18 states,
including,  the NASCAR  Craftsmen Truck Series,  the NASCAR Busch Series race in
Dallas,  five  National  Hotrod  Racing  Association  races in Topeka,  Memphis,
Houston and Dallas,  as well as the O'Reilly Chili Bowl.  O'Reilly Auto Parts is
the  "official  auto parts  store" of Texas  Motor  Speedway,  Kansas  Speedway,
Bristol  Motor  Speedway,   Houston  Raceway  Park,  Texas  Motorplex,   Memphis
Motorsports  Park and Heartland  Park.  During 2003, we started work on branding
the O'Reilly name in the NCAA.  Our first  initiative  was to partner with Texas
Tech  University  through a variety of programs  including  sponsoring  of coach
Knight's  TV show,  ads during  games,  placing  the  O'Reilly  logo on the home
basketball court and coach Knight's  sweater,  advertising on the backs of seats
and banners for the scoring  table.  This has lead to  additional  opportunities
with  approximately 14 colleges in our current  markets.  We have found that the
more progressive  marketing concepts utilized in the DIY portion of our business
can also be applied to increase sales to our professional installer customers.

     Marketing  to the  Professional  Installer.  We  have  over  173  full-time
O'Reilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve,  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer. Our First Call program, which is
our commitment to the professional  customer,  includes a dedicated sales force,
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer.
Moreover,  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis. Our First Call marketing  strategy,  with respect to professional
installers, emphasizes our ability to offer:

o    prompt delivery using small trucks or vans operated by virtually all of our
     stores;

o    a separate  counter in all of our stores  dedicated  exclusively to serving
     professional installers;

o    trade credit for qualified professional installers;

o    broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing;

o    a  professional  installer  computer  system that connects  directly to our
     inventory system; and

o    seminars concerning topics of interest to professional installers,  such as
     technical updates, safety and general business management.

     Marketing to the Independently  Owned Parts Store. Along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
O'Reilly  stores,  Ozark  Automotive  Distributors,   Inc.  (Ozark)  also  sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an O'Reilly  store.  We generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products,   but  have,  on  occasion,   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by Ozark.  Ozark  operates  its own
separate  marketing program to independently  owned parts stores through a staff
of three.

     Of  the  approximately  215  independently  owned  parts  stores  currently
purchasing  automotive  products from Ozark,  211  participate in the Auto Value
program through Ozark. As a participant in this program,  an independently owned
parts store which meets certain minimum  financial and operational  standards is
permitted to indicate its Auto Value membership  through the display of the Auto
Value logo, which is owned by The Alliance,  Inc.  (formerly known as Auto Value
Associates,  Inc.), a non-profit buying group consisting of approximately  4,500
members as of December 31, 2003, including O'Reilly, engaged in the distribution
or sale  of  automotive  products.  Additionally,  we  provide  advertising  and
promotional  assistance to Auto Value stores purchasing automotive products from
Ozark,  as well as marketing  and sales  support.  In return for a commitment to
purchase  automotive  products from Ozark, we offer  assistance to an Auto Value
independently  owned  parts  store by making  available  computer  software  for
inventory control.




Management Structure

     Each of our  stores  is  staffed  with a  store  manager  and an  assistant
manager, in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet
the specific needs of each store.  Each of our 106 district managers has general
supervisory  responsibility  for an average of 10 stores  within such  manager's
district.

     Each  district  manager  receives  comprehensive  training on a  bi-monthly
basis, focusing on management techniques,  new product  announcements,  advanced
automotive  systems and our policies and  procedures.  In turn, the  information
covered at such bi-monthly meetings is discussed in full by district managers at
bi-monthly  meetings  with their store  managers.  All  assistant  managers  and
manager  trainees  are  required to  successfully  complete a six-month  manager
training program, which includes classroom and field training, as a prerequisite
to becoming a store manager. This program covers operations extensively, as well
as principles of successful management.  Shortly after becoming a store manager,
all managers  attend a manager  development  program,  at the  corporate  office
headquarters,  which includes 72 hours of classroom training.  Upon returning to
the stores,  managers  are given  continuous  field  training  throughout  their
management experience.

     We provide financial  incentives to our district managers,  store managers,
assistant  managers  and sales  specialists  through an  incentive  compensation
program.  Under our incentive  compensation program, base salary is augmented by
incentive  compensation  based upon the  achievement of sales and  profitability
goals.  We  believe  that  our  incentive   compensation  program  significantly
increases the  motivation  and overall  performance  of our  Professional  Parts
People and our  ability to attract  and retain  qualified  management  and other
personnel.

     Most of our current senior management, district managers and store managers
were promoted to their positions from within the Company.  Our senior management
team averages 16 years of experience with the Company and district managers have
an average length of service with the Company of over 9 years.

Professional Parts People

     We  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  Professional  Parts  People  is
essential in providing  superior service both to DIY and professional  installer
customers.  Each of our Professional  Parts People is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer.
In addition,  we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons,  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts.
We believe  that the ability of our  Professional  Parts  People to provide such
assistance  to  the  DIY  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customer's visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
DIY business.

     We  screen  prospective  employees,  whom we refer to as team  members,  to
identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts
or repairs, or an aptitude for automotive  knowledge.  Each person who becomes a
team member first  participates  in an  intensive  two-day  orientation  program
designed to  introduce  the team member to our culture and his or her job duties
before being assigned specific job  responsibilities.  The successful completion
of additional training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a
parts  specialist  and  thus  able to work at the  parts  counter  of one of our
stores. All new counter people are required to successfully complete a six-month
basic  automotive  systems  training course and are then enrolled in a six-month
advanced  automotive  systems course for certification by the National Institute
for Automotive Service  Excellence (ASE),  which administers  national exams for
various  automotive  specialties and requires ASE certified  specialists to take
recertification exams every five years.

     Each of our stores  participates in our sales specialist  training program.
Under this program,  selected team members  complete two days of extensive sales
call  training  for  business  development,  after which these team members will
spend  one day per week  calling  on  existing  and new  professional  installer
customers.  Additionally, each team member engaged in such sales activities will
participate  in  quarterly  advanced  training  programs  for sales and business
development.




Customer Service

     We seek to provide our customers  with an efficient  and pleasant  in-store
experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products.  We believe that the  satisfaction of DIY and
professional installer customers is substantially  dependent upon our ability to
provide,  in a  timely  fashion,  the  specific  automotive  product  requested.
Accordingly,  each  O'Reilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications.   We
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores,  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.

Pricing

     We believe that a competitive  pricing  policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully.  Product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store.  Most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices,  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing.  Consistent
with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any in-stock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors.

Competition

     We  compete  in both the DIY and  professional  installer  portions  of the
automotive aftermarket. We compete primarily with:

o    national and  regional  retail  automotive  parts chains (such as AutoZone,
     Inc.,  Advance Auto Parts,  CSK Auto Corp. and The Pep Boys-Manny,  Moe and
     Jack, Inc.);

o    independently owned parts stores;

o    wholesalers  or jobber stores (some of which are  associated  with national
     automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA and CarQuest);

o    automobile dealers; and

o    mass  merchandisers that carry automotive  replacement  parts,  maintenance
     items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).

     We compete on the basis of customer  service,  which  includes  merchandise
selection and  availability,  price,  helpfulness  of store  personnel and store
layout and location.



Team Members

     As of December 31,  2003,  we had 12,635  full-time  team members and 2,919
part-time team members,  of whom 12,023 were employed at our stores,  2,587 were
employed at our distribution  centers and 944 were employed at our corporate and
administrative  headquarters.  Our team  members are not subject to a collective
bargaining  agreement.  We consider  our  relations  with our team members to be
excellent,  and strive to promote good relations  with our team members  through
various programs designed for such purposes.

Servicemarks and Trademarks

     We have  registered the  servicemarks  O'Reilly  Automotive,  O'Reilly Auto
Parts,  and Parts Payoff and the trademarks  SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Omnispark,
First  Call,  Ultima,  and  Master  Pro.  Further,  we are  licensed  to use the
registered  trademarks and servicemarks Auto Value and Parts Master owned by The
Alliance  (formerly  Auto Value  Associates)  in  connection  with our marketing
program.  We believe  that our  business  is not  otherwise  dependent  upon any
patent, trademark, servicemark or copyright.

Regulations

     Although subject to various laws and governmental  regulations  relating to
our business, including those related to the environment, we do not believe that
compliance with such laws and  regulations has a material  adverse effect on our
operations.  Further, we are unaware of any failure to comply with any such laws
and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We
can not give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses
in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation.

Internet Address and Access to SEC Filings

     Our Internet address is www.oreillyauto.com.  Interested readers can access
the  Company's  annual  reports  on Form 10-K,  quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q,
current  reports  on Form 8-K,  and any  amendments  to those  reports  filed or
furnished  pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended,  through the  Securities and Exchange  Commissions  website at
www.sec.gov.  Such  reports are  generally  available on the day they are filed.
Additionally,  the Company will furnish  interested readers a paper copy of such
reports, upon request, free of charge.

Risk Factors

     Some of the  information  in this Form 10-K contains and future reports and
press  releases  and  other  public  information  may  contain   forward-looking
statements that involve  substantial risks and  uncertainties.  You can identify
these  statements  by  forward-looking  words such as "may,"  "will,"  "expect,"
"anticipate,"  "believe,"  "estimate,"  and "continue" or similar  words.  These
"forward-looking   statements"  are  made  in  reliance  upon  the  safe  harbor
provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (See Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.) You should read statements that contain these words carefully  because
they: (1) discuss our future expectations; (2) contain projections of our future
results  of  operations  or of  our  financial  condition;  or (3)  state  other
"forward-looking"  information.  We believe it is important to  communicate  our
expectations to our investors.  However,  there may be events in the future that
we are not able to accurately predict or over which we have no control.

     The risk factors listed in this section, as well as any cautionary language
in this  Form  10-K,  are  subject  to  risks,  uncertainties  and  assumptions,
including, but not limited to, competition,  product demand, the market for auto
parts,  the economy in general,  inflation,  consumer debt levels,  governmental
approvals, our ability to hire and retain qualified employees,  risks associated
with the integration of acquired business,  weather,  terrorist activities,  war
and the threat of war.  Actual  results may materially  differ from  anticipated
results described in these forward-looking  statements. You should be aware that
the  occurrence  of the events  described in these risk factors and elsewhere in
this Form 10-K could have a material  adverse effect on our business,  operating
results and financial condition.



The Automotive Aftermarket Business is Highly Competitive

     Both the DIY and professional installer portions of our business are highly
competitive,  particularly  in the more densely  populated  areas that we serve.
Some of our  competitors  are  larger  than we are and  have  greater  financial
resources.  In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. For a list of our
principal  competitors,  see the ''Competition''  section of Item 1 of this Form
10-K.

We Cannot Assure Future Growth

     We believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future.  Failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock.  Our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather
conditions,  zoning and other issues related to new store site development,  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions.  We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2004 and beyond will be
achieved.  For a  discussion  of our  growth  strategies,  see the  "Growth  and
Expansion Strategies" section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

Acquisitions May Not Lead to Expected Growth

     We expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy.  Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations. For example: (1) we may not be able to continue
to identify suitable  acquisition  candidates or to acquire additional companies
at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; (2) our management's  attention
may be distracted;  (3) we may fail to retain key acquired personnel; (4) we may
assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; and (5) we may not be
able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions,
for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other
benefits.


Sensitivity to Regional Economic and Weather Conditions

     All of our stores are located in the Central and Southern United States. In
particular, approximately 34% of our stores are located in Texas. Therefore, our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions.
Unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales, particularly to DIY
customers.



Dependence Upon Key and Other Personnel

     Our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel,  including David O'Reilly, Ted Wise, Greg Henslee and Jim Batten. Our
business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the
loss of the  services  of one or more of these  individuals.  Additionally,  our
successful  implementation and management of our growth and expansion strategies
will  depend  on our  ability  to  continue  to  attract  and  retain  qualified
personnel.  We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue  to attract  such
personnel.  For a further  discussion of our management  and personnel,  see the
''Business''  section  of Item 1 and Item 4a of this  Form  10-K  and our  Proxy
Statement on Schedule 14A for the 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a portion
of which is incorporated herein.

Significant Voting Control is held by the O'Reilly Family

     As of the date of this Form 10-K,  the O'Reilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  10%, or 5,255,582 number of shares, of the outstanding  shares of
our common stock. As a result, the O'Reilly family, if they act, acting together
represents  one of the largest known blocks of our shares and may continue to be
a significant  factor in any matter voted on by our shareholders,  including the
election  of our  directors  and any merger,  sale of assets or other  change in
control.

Possible Volatility of Our Stock Price

     The stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions.  The
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts' expectations.  Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock.  In addition,
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies.  In the past, following periods of volatility in
the market price of a company's  securities,  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company.  If similar  litigation were
instituted  against us, it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our management's attention and resources,  which could have an adverse effect on
our business.

Shares Eligible for Future Sale

     All of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended,  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule. We cannot predict the effect,  if any, that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time.  Sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock,  or the perception  that such sales might occur,  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.



Item 2.  Properties

     The   following   table   provides   certain   information   regarding  our
administrative  offices and distribution  centers and offices as of December 31,
2003:


     Of the 1,109 stores that we operated at December 31, 2003,  375 stores were
owned,  664 stores  were  leased  from  unaffiliated  parties and 70 stores were
leased from one of three  entities  owned by the  O'Reilly  family.  Leases with
unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment
of certain tax, insurance and maintenance  expenses,  and an original term of 10
years,  subject to one or more  renewals at our  option.  We have  entered  into
separate master lease  agreements  with each of the affiliated  entities for the
occupancy of the stores covered thereby.  Such master lease agreements expire on
December 31, 2004. We believe that the lease agreements with the entities are on
terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.

     We  believe  that  our  present  facilities  are  in  good  condition,  are
adequately insured and together with those under construction,  are suitable and
adequate for the conduct of our current operations.




Item 3. Legal Proceedings

     The Company is involved in various  other legal  proceedings  incidental to
the conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters,  it does not  currently
believe that, in the aggregate,  they will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated  financial  position,  results of  operations  or cash flows of the
Company.

Item 4. Submission Of Matters To A Vote Of Security Holders

     No matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders,  through  the
solicitation  of proxies or otherwise,  during the fourth  quarter of the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2003.

Item 4A. Executive Officers of the Company

     The following  paragraphs  discuss  information about executive officers of
the Company who are not also directors:

Real  Estate.  He began his  O'Reilly  career in sales in 1970,  was promoted to

     Greg L. Henslee, age 43, Co-President, has been an O'Reilly team member for

Systems and  Distributions.  His O'Reilly career started as a Parts  Specialist,
and during his first five years he served in several  positions  in retail store

Operations  Manager,  and over the past ten years,  he has served as Director of
Computer Operations/Loss  Prevention,  Vice President of Store Operations and as
Senior Vice  President.  He has been in his current  position  as  President  of
Merchandise,  Distribution,  Information  Systems and Loss Prevention since July

& Keehn, from 1986 to 1993 and Deloitte, Haskins & Sells from 1984 until 1986.

Item 7A. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     At  December  31,  2003,   we  had  floating  rate   obligations   totaling
approximately  $20.0 million for amounts outstanding under our revolving line of
credit and long-term debt. These floating rate obligations expose us to the risk
of increased  interest expense in the event of increases in short-term rates. If
the  floating  interest  rate were to increase by 100 basis  points (or 1%) from
December 31, 2003  levels,  our interest  expense  would  increase by a total of
approximately $16,667 per month.

of our chief executive  officer and chief financial  officer,  have reviewed and
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's  disclosure controls and procedures
as of  December  31,  2003.  Based on such  review  and  evaluation,  our  chief
executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the disclosure
controls and  procedures  were effective as of December 31, 2003, to ensure that
the  information  required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  (a) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in
the  SEC's  rules  and  forms and (b) is  accumulated  and  communicated  to the
Company's  management,  including the officers,  as  appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required  disclosure.  There were no material changes in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of
2003 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

    Exhibit 10.29 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan

                            O'REILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC.
                         2003 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN

I.   Purpose of the Plan.

     The O'Reilly Automotive,  Inc. 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Plan")
is  intended  to provide a means  whereby  certain  key  employees  of  O'Reilly
Automotive, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the "Company"), may develop a sense of
proprietorship and personal involvement in the development and financial success
of the Company and its  subsidiaries,  and to encourage  them to remain with and
devote their best  efforts to the business of the Company and its  subsidiaries,
thereby   advancing  the   interests  of  the  Company  and  its   shareholders.
Accordingly,  the Company may make  awards to certain  employees  in the form of
stock options  ("Options") with respect to shares of the Company's common stock,
par value  $0.01 per share (the  "Stock").  Options  may either be  nonqualified
stock options  ("Nonqualified  Options") or options  ("Incentive Stock Options")
that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

II.  Administration.

     (a)  Committee  Composition.  The Plan shall be administered by a committee
          of the Board of Directors of the Company (the  "Board")  consisting of
          not less than two members of the Board as the Board may  appoint  (the
          "Committee").  The  members of the  Committee  shall be  "Non-Employee
          Directors"  within the  meaning of Rule  16b-3  promulgated  under the
          Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), and "outside
          directors"  as defined  under  Section  162(m) of the Code;  provided,
          however,   that  noncompliance  with  such  qualifications  shall  not
          invalidate any grants of Options by the Committee.  Committee  members
          may  resign at any time by  delivering  written  notice to the  Board.
          Vacancies in the  Committee,  however  caused,  shall be filled by the
          Board.  The Committee shall act by a majority of its members in office
          and the  Committee  may act  either by vote at a  telephonic  or other
          meeting or by a consent or other written  instrument  signed by all of
          the members of the Committee.  If the Committee does not exist, or for
          any  other  reason  determined  by the  Board,  the Board mat take any
          action under the Plan that would  otherwise be the  responsibility  of
          the Committee.

     (b)  Committee  Authority.  The Committee shall have the sole authority to:
          (i) determine the terms and provisions of the Option  agreements  (the
          "Agreements")   entered   into  under  the  Plan;   (ii)  prepare  and
          distribute,   in  such  manner  as  the  Committee  determines  to  be
          appropriate,  information  about  the Plan;  and (iii)  make all other
          determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of
          the Plan.  The  Committee  may vary the terms  and  provisions  of the
          individual Agreements in its discretion.  Further, the Committee shall
          have authority to grant options and to determine the exercise price of
          the Stock  covered  by each  Option,  the terms and  duration  of each
          Option,  the key  employees to whom,  and the times at which,  Options
          shall be granted, whether the Option shall be a Nonqualified Option or
          an  Incentive  Stock  Option and the number of shares to be covered by
          each Option.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Committee shall not
          have  the   authority  to  make  any   determination   that  would  be
          inconsistent  with the  requirements,  restrictions,  prohibitions  or
          limitations specified in the Plan.

     (c)  Day-to-Day  Administration.  The day-to-day administration of the Plan
          may be carried out by such  officers  and  employees of the Company as
          shall be designated  from time to time by the Committee.  All expenses
          and  liabilities  incurred by the  Committee  in  connection  with the
          administration  of  the  Plan  shall  be  borne  by the  Company.  The
          Committee may employ attorneys, consultants,  accountants, appraisers,
          brokers or other persons,  and the Committee,  the Board,  the Company
          and the  officers and  employees  of the Company  shall be entitled to
          rely upon the advice,  opinions or valuations of any such persons. The
          interpretation  and  construction by the Committee of any provision of
          the Plan and any determination by the Committee under any provision of
          the Plan shall be final and conclusive  for all purposes.  Neither the
          Committee  nor any  member  thereof  shall  be  liable  for  any  act,
          omission,  interpretation,   construction  or  determination  made  in
          connection  with  the  Plan in good  faith,  and  the  members  of the
          Committee shall be entitled to  indemnification  and  reimbursement by
          the  Company  in  respect  of  any  claim,  loss,  damage  or  expense
          (including  counsel  fees)  arising  therefrom  to the fullest  extent
          permitted  by law.  The  members  of the  Committee  shall be named as
          insureds in  connection  with any  directors  and  officers  liability
          insurance coverage that may be in effect from time to time.

             Exhibit 10.29 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. 2003 Employee
                         Stock Option Plan (continued)

III. Shares Subject to the Plan.

The  aggregate  number of shares  that may be  issued  under the Plan  shall not
exceed  4,000,000  shares of Stock  plus all  shares  authorized  under the 1993
Employee  Stock  Option  Plan not  covered  by an  option  on the date such plan
expires.  No more than 1,000,000  shares of Stock may be subject to Options that
are intended to be  "performance-based  compensation"  (as that term is used for
purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code) granted to any one individual during any
calendar  year,  regardless of when such shares are  deliverable.  The shares of
Stock issuable  under the Plan may consist of authorized but unissued  shares of
Stock or  previously  issued shares of Stock  reacquired by the Company.  Any of
such shares that remain unsold and that are not subject to  outstanding  Options
at the  termination of the Plan shall cease to be subject to the Plan, but until
termination  of the Plan and the  expiration  of all Options  granted  under the
Plan,  the  Company  shall at all times make  available a  sufficient  number of
shares to meet the requirements of the Plan and the outstanding  Options. If any
Option, in whole or in part,  expires or terminates  unexercised or is cancelled
or forfeited, the shares theretofore subject to such Option may again be subject
to an Option granted under the Plan. The aggregate  number of shares that may be
issued under  Options  granted under the Plan and any maximums set forth in this
Plan  shall be subject  to  adjustment  as  provided  in  Article V hereof.  The
issuance  of Stock  pursuant  to the  exercise  of an Option  shall  result in a
decrease in the number of shares of Stock that may  thereafter  be available for
purposes of the Plan by the number of shares as to which the Option is exercised
or cancelled.

IV.  Grants of Options.

     (a)  Type and Number.  Options granted under the Plan shall be of such type
          (Nonqualified Option or Incentive Stock Option) and for such number of
          shares of Stock  and  subject  to such  terms  and  conditions  as the
          Committee shall designate. The Committee may grant Options at any time
          and from time to time  through,  but not after,  May 6,  2013,  to any
          individual eligible to receive the same. For purposes of the Plan, the
          date on which an Option is granted is referred to herein as the "Grant
          Date."

     (b)  Option  Agreement.  Options  granted  pursuant  to the  Plan  shall be
          evidenced by  Agreements  that shall comply with and be subject to the
          terms and conditions set forth in this Section IV and may contain such
          other  provisions,  consistent  with the Plan, as the Committee  shall
          deem advisable.  Each Agreement shall state the total number of shares
          of  Stock  that  are  subject  to the  Option.  References  herein  to
          "Agreements" shall include,  to the extent applicable,  any amendments
          to such Agreements.

     (c)  Persons Eligible to Receive Options.

          (i)  Only key  employees of the Company or its  subsidiaries  shall be
               eligible to receive  Options under the Plan. In granting  Options
               to an employee,  the Committee shall take into  consideration the
               contribution  the employee has made or may make to the success of
               the Company or its subsidiaries and such other  considerations as
               the Committee shall determine.  The Committee shall also have the
               authority  to  consult  with  and  receive  recommendations  from
               officers and other employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries
               with regard to these matters. In no event shall any employee, his
               legal   representatives,   heirs,  legatees,   distributees,   or
               successors  have any right to participate in the Plan,  except to
               such extent, if any, as the Committee shall determine.

          (ii) Options  may be  granted  under  the  Plan  from  time to time in
               substitution  for stock  options  and stock  appreciation  rights
               granted by other  corporations  (the "Acquired  Corporation")  to
               their employees who become key employees of the Company or of any
               of its  subsidiaries as a result of a merger or  consolidation of
               the Acquired Corporation with the Company or any such subsidiary,
               or the  acquisition  by the  Company  or a  subsidiary  of all or
               substantially  all of the assets of the Acquired  Corporation  or
               the  acquisition  by the Company or a subsidiary  of stock of the
               Acquired corporation.

     (d)  Exercise Price.



                 O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries
             Exhibit 10.29 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. 2003 Employee
                         Stock Option Plan (continued)

          (i)  The exercise  price of each share of Stock covered by each Option
               ("Exercise  Price")  shall not be less than one  hundred  percent
               (100%) of the Market  Value Per Share (as  defined  below) of the
               Stock on the date the Option is granted;  provided,  however,  if
               and when an  Incentive  Stock  Option is granted and the employee
               receiving the  Incentive  Stock Option owns or will be considered
               to own by  reason  of  Section  424(d)  of the Code more than ten
               percent (10%) of the total  combined  voting power of all classes
               of stock of the Company (a "10% Shareholder"), the Exercise Price
               of the Stock covered by such Incentive  Stock Option shall not be
               less than one hundred and ten percent  (110%) of the Market Value
               Per Share of the Stock on the Grant Date of the  Incentive  Stock
               Option.

          (ii) "Market  Value Per  Share" of the Stock  shall  mean:  (A) if the
               Stock  is not  publicly  traded,  the  amount  determined  by the
               Committee  on the  date of the  grant of the  Option;  (B) if the
               Stock is traded only otherwise than on a securities  exchange and
               is not quoted on the National  Association of Securities  Dealers
               Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ"), the closing quoted selling
               price of the  Stock on the date of grant of the  Option as quoted
               in  "pink  sheets"  published  by the  National  Daily  Quotation
               Bureau;  (C) if the  Stock is  traded  only  otherwise  than on a
               securities  exchange and is quoted on NASDAQ,  the closing quoted
               selling price of the Stock on the date of grant of the Option, as
               reported  by the  Wall  Street  Journal;  or (D) if the  Stock is
               admitted to trading on a securities exchange,  the closing quoted
               selling price of the Stock on the date of grant of the Option, as
               reported in the Wall Street Journal.

     (e)  Exercisability of Options.

          (i)  An Option may be  exercisable in  installments  or otherwise upon
               such terms as the Committee  shall  determine  when the Option is
               granted.  The  Committee  may fix  such  waiting  and/or  vesting
               periods,  exercise  dates or other  limitations  as it shall deem
               appropriate  with  respect  to  Options  granted  under  the Plan
               including, without limitation,  making the exercisability thereof
               contingent    upon   the    achievement   of   specific    goals.
               Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  however,  in no event  shall an
               Option, or any portion thereof, be exercisable until at least six
               months after the date of grant of such Option.

          (ii) The Committee at any time:  (A) may  accelerate the time at which
               any Option granted hereunder is exercisable or otherwise vary the
               terms of an Option,  notwithstanding  the fact that such variance
               may cause the Option to be treated as a Nonqualified  Option; (B)
               in  the  case  of  a   Nonqualified   Option,   may   permit  the
               transferability of such Option and may remove any restrictions or
               conditions  to which a  Nonqualified  Option is subject;  and (C)
               subject  to  the  consent  of  the   optionee,   may  convert  an
               outstanding Incentive Stock Option to a Nonqualified Option if it
               deems such conversion to be in the best interest of the optionee.

          (iii)No Option shall be exercisable (and any attempted  exercise shall
               be deemed null and void) if such exercise would create a right of
               recovery for  "short-swing  profits"  under  Section 16(b) of the
               Act,  unless the  optionee  pays the  Company  the amount of such
               "short-swing profits" at the time of the exercise of the Option.

          (iv) To  the  extent  that  the  aggregate   Market  Value  Per  Share
               (determined  at the Grant  Date) of Stock  with  respect to which
               Incentive  Stock  Options  (determined  without  regard  to  this
               sentence) are  exercisable  for the first time by any  individual
               during any calendar  year (under all plans of the Company and its
               subsidiaries)  exceeds One Hundred Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000),
               such excess  portion of such  Incentive  Stock  Options  shall be
               treated as  Nonqualified  Options (this sentence shall be applied
               by taking  Incentive  Stock  Options into account in the order in
               which they were granted).


     (f)  Method of Exercise and Payment of Exercise Price.

          (i)  Options may be exercised by giving  written notice to the Company
               stating  the  number  of shares  for  which  the  Option is being
               exercised,  accompanied  by payment in full of the Exercise Price
               relating  to the  shares  with  respect to which the Option is so
               exercised.



                   O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries
             Exhibit 10.29 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. 2003 Employee
                         Stock Option Plan (continued)

          (ii) The full Exercise  Price for the shares with respect to which the
               Option is being exercised shall be payable to the Company: (A) in
               cash or by check  payable  and  acceptable  to the  Company;  (B)
               subject to the  approval of the  Committee,  by  tendering to the
               Company shares of Stock owned by the optionee having an aggregate
               Market  Value  Per Share as of the date of  exercise  that is not
               greater than the full Exercise  Price for the shares with respect
               to which the Option is being exercised, provided that such shares
               shall  have been then  owned by the  optionee  for a period of at
               least  six  months  prior to such  exercise,  and by  paying  any
               remaining  amount of the Exercise Price as provided in (A) above;
               or (C)  subject  to the  approval  of the  Committee  and to such
               instructions  as the  Committee  may specify,  at the  optionee's
               written  request the Company  may  deliver  certificates  for the
               shares  of Stock for which  the  Option is being  exercised  to a
               broker  for sale on behalf  of the  optionee,  provided  that the
               optionee has irrevocably instructed such broker to remit directly
               to the  Company on the  optionee's  behalf the full amount of the
               Exercise Price from the proceeds of such sale; provided, however,
               that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option,  (B) and (C) above
               shall  apply only if  Committee  approval is given on or prior to
               the Grant  Date and the  Agreement  expressly  provides  for such
               optional  payment terms. In the event that the optionee elects to
               make  payment as allowed  under clause (B) above,  the  Committee
               may, upon  confirming that the optionee owns the number of shares
               of  Stock  being  tendered,  authorize  the  issuance  of  a  new
               certificate  for the number of shares being acquired  pursuant to
               the  exercise  of the  Option  less the  number of  shares  being
               tendered  upon the  exercise  and return to the  optionee (or not
               require  surrender  of) the  certificate  for the shares of Stock
               being  tendered upon the exercise.  Payment  instruments  will be
               received subject to collection.

          (iii)Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of the Plan,  the  Company
               shall have no  liability to deliver any shares of Stock under the
               Plan or make any other  distribution  of benefits  under the Plan
               unless  such  delivery  or  distribution  would  comply  with all
               applicable laws (including,  without limitation, the requirements
               of the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended),  and the applicable
               requirements  of any securities  exchange,  the NASDAQ or similar
               entity.  If the employee  fails to timely accept  delivery of and
               pay for the shares specified in such notice,  the Committee shall
               have the right to  terminate  the  Option  with  respect  to such
               shares.

     (g)  Term.

          (i)  The term of each Option shall be  determined  by the Committee at
               the  Grant  Date;  provided,  however,  that each  Option  shall,
               notwithstanding  anything  in the  Plan or any  Agreement  to the
               contrary, expire not more than ten years (five years with respect
               to an Incentive  Stock Option granted to an employee who is a 10%
               Shareholder)  from  the  Grant  Date  or,  if  earlier,  the date
               specified in the Agreement.

          (ii) In the event an individual's  employment with the Company and its
               subsidiaries   shall   terminate  for  reasons  other  than:  (i)
               retirement in accordance  with the terms of a retirement  plan of
               the  Company  or  one of its  subsidiaries  ("Retirement");  (ii)
               permanent  disability  (as  defined  in Section  22(e)(3)  of the
               Code); or (iii) death, the  individual's  Options shall terminate
               as of the date of such termination of employment and shall not be
               exercisable to any extent as of and after such time.

          (iii)If  any  termination  of  employment  is  due  to  Retirement  or
               permanent  disability,  the  individual  shall  have the right to
               exercise  any  Option  at any time  within  the  12-month  period
               (three-month  period in the case of  Retirement  for Options that
               are  Incentive  Stock  Options)  following  such  termination  of
               employment,   but  only  to  the  extent   that  the  Option  was
               exercisable  immediately prior to such termination of employment.
               Notwithstanding  any other provision contained in the Plan or the
               Agreements,   if  the   termination   of  employment  is  due  to
               retirement,  and such  retiring  individual at the time of his or
               her retirement (A) is at least  fifty-five (55) years of age, and
               (B) the sum of the  individual's  age and years of service to the
               Company is equal to or greater  than eighty (80) years,  then all
               outstanding  options  granted to such retiring  individual  shall
               automatically become immediately exercisable within such 12-month
               period  (three  month  period  in the  case of  Options  that are
               Incentive Stock Options).

          (iv) Whether any  termination  of  employment  is due to Retirement or
               permanent  disability and whether an authorized  leave of absence
               or  absence  for  military  or  government  service  or for other
               reasons shall constitute a termination of employment for purposes
               of the Plan  shall be  determined  by the  Committee  in its sole
               discretion.

                         Stock Option Plan (continued)

          (v)  If an individual  shall die while entitled to exercise an Option,
               the individual's estate,  personal representative or beneficiary,
               as the case may be,  shall have the right to exercise  the Option
               at any time within the 12-month period  following the date of the
               optionee's death, to the extent that the optionee was entitled to
               exercise the same on the day immediately  prior to the optionee's
               death.

          (vi) The right of an individual to exercise an Option shall  terminate
               to the extent that such Option is exercised.

V.   Corporate Transactions and Adjustment.

     (a)  Effect on Corporate Actions. The existence of the Plan and the Options
          granted  hereunder  shall not  affect in any way the right or power of
          the Board of Directors or the  shareholders  of the Company to make or
          authorize any adjustment,  recapitalization,  reorganization  or other
          change in the Company's capital structure or its business,  any merge'
          or  consolidation  of the Company  with or into  another  entity,  any
          issuance of bonds,  debentures,  preferred or prior preference  stocks
          ahead of or affecting the Stock or the rights thereof, the dissolution
          or  liquidation  of the  Company or any sale or transfer of all or any
          part  of its  assets  or  business,  or  any  other  corporate  act or
          proceeding.

     (b)  Adjustment.  The shares with  respect to which  Options may be granted
          are shares of Stock as presently constituted.  If, however, the number
          of  outstanding  shares of Stock are increased or  decreased,  or such
          shares  are  exchanged  for a  different  number  or kind of shares or
          securities   of   the   Company   through   reorganization,    merger,
          recapitalization,   reclassification,  stock  dividend,  stock  split,
          combination  of shares or other  similar  transaction,  the  aggregate
          number of shares of Stock  subject  to the Plan and any  maximums  set
          forth in Section III hereof, and the shares of Stock subject to issued
          and  outstanding  Options  under the Plan shall be  appropriately  and
          proportionately  adjusted by the Committee.  Any such adjustment in an
          outstanding  Option  shall be made  without  change  in the  aggregate
          Exercise Price applicable to the unexercised portion of the Option but
          with an  appropriate  adjustment  in the price for each share or other
          unit of any security covered by the Option.

     (c)  No Adjustment Upon Issuance of Securities.  Except as may otherwise be
          expressly  provided in the Plan, the issuance by the Company of shares
          of capital stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of
          capital stock of any class for cash, property, labor or services, upon
          direct  sale,  upon the  exercise of rights or  warrants to  subscribe
          therefor,  or upon  conversion of shares or obligations of the Company
          convertible into such shares of capital stock or other securities, and
          in any case  whether or not for fair value,  shall not affect,  and no
          adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number
          of shares of Stock  available  under the Plan or  subject  to  Options
          theretofore  granted or the  Exercise  Price per share with respect to
          outstanding Options.

     (d)  Final  Determination.  Adjustments under this Section shall be made by
          the Committee  whose  determination  as to what  adjustments  shall be
          made, and the extent thereof,  shall be final, binding and conclusive.
          No  fractional  shares of Stock  shall be issued  under the Plan or in
          connection with any such adjustment.

     (e)  Automatic Termination of Plan and Options. Notwithstanding anything to
          the contrary contained in this Section V, upon: (i) the dissolution or
          liquidation  of  the  Company,   (ii)  a  reorganization,   merger  or
          consolidation  of the Company with one or more  corporations  in which
          the  Company  is not the  surviving  corporation,  or  (iii) a sale of
          substantially  all of  the  assets  of the  Company,  the  Plan  shall
          terminate,  and any  outstanding  Options granted under the Plan shall
          terminate  on the day  before  the  consummation  of the  transaction;
          provided  that  the  Committee  shall  have  the  right,  but  not the
          obligation,  to  accelerate  the  time in  which  any  Options  may be
          exercised  prior to such a termination.  However,  the  termination of
          such  Options  shall  not occur if  provision  is made in  writing  in
          connection  with  the  transaction,  in a  manner  acceptable  to  the
          Committee,  for: (A) the  continuance  of the Plan and  assumption  of
          outstanding  Options,  (B) the  substitution  for such  Options of new
          options to purchase the stock of a successor corporation (or parent or
          subsidiary  thereof),  with  appropriate  adjustments as to number and
          kind of shares and option price or (C) other  treatment of the Options
          acceptable to the Committee. The Committee shall have the authority to
          amend this  paragraph  to provide for a  requirement  that a successor
          corporation assume any outstanding Options.

             Exhibit 10.29 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. 2003 Employee
                         Stock Option Plan (continued)

VI.  Term of Plan.

No Option  shall be granted  pursuant  to the Plan after ten (10) years from the
earlier of the date of  adoption  of the Plan by the Board of the Company or the
date of approval by the Company's  shareholders.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a longer term is permitted with respect to the duration of an incentive stock
option plan under law,  the Board may extend the term of this Plan to a term not
to exceed the longest term permitted  with respect to an incentive  stock option
plan.

VII. Amendment and Termination of Plan.

     (a)  Authority to Amend and  Terminate.  The Board may,  from time to time,
          with respect to any shares at the time not subject to Options, suspend
          or  terminate  the Plan or  amend or  revise  the  terms of the  Plan;
          provided  that any  amendment  to the  Plan  shall  be  approved  by a
          majority of the shareholders of the Company if the amendment would (i)
          materially  increase or decrease the benefits accruing to participants
          under the Plan;  (ii)  increase  or  decrease  the number of shares of
          Stock which may be issued under the Plan,  except as  permitted  under
          the  provisions  of Section V above;  or (iii)  materially  modify the
          requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.

     (b)  Consent of Optionholder Required. Subject to the provisions in Section
          V above,  no amendment,  suspension or termination of this Plan shall,
          without  the  consent of the  optionee,  alter or impair any rights or
          obligations under any Option granted to such optionee under the Plan.

VIII. Effective Date of Plan.

The Plan shall become  effective  upon adoption by the Board and approval by the
Company's shareholders; provided, however, that prior to approval of the Plan by
the  Company's  shareholders  but after  adoption  by the Board,  Options may be
granted under the Plan subject to obtaining such approval.

IX.  Preemption by Applicable Laws and Regulations.

Anything in the Plan or any  Agreement  entered into pursuant to the Plan to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  if, at any time specified  herein or therein for the
making of any determination  with respect to the issuance or other  distribution
of shares of Stock,  any law,  regulation  or  requirement  of any  governmental
authority  having  jurisdiction in the premises shall require either the Company
or the optionee  (or the  optionee's  beneficiary),  as the case may be, to take
any'action  in  connection  with  any  such   determination,   the  issuance  or
distribution  of such  shares  or the  making  of such  determination  shall  be
deferred until such action shall have been taken.

X.   Miscellaneous.

     (a)  Taxes and Withholding. All distributions under the Plan are subject to
          withholding of all applicable  taxes,  and the Committee may condition
          the  delivery  of any  shares  or  other  benefits  under  the Plan on
          satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligations. The Committee,
          in its discretion,  and subject to such  requirements as the Committee
          may impose prior to the  occurrence  of such  withholding,  may permit
          such withholding  obligations to be satisfied  through cash payment by
          the  optionee,  through  the  surrender  of shares  of Stock  that the
          optionee  already owns, or through the surrender of shares of Stock to
          which the optionee is otherwise entitled under the Plan.

     (b)  No  Employment  Contract.  Nothing  contained  in the  Plan  shall  be
          construed as conferring upon any optionee the right to continue in the
          employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

     (c)  Employment  with  Subsidiaries.  Employment  by the  Company  for  the
          purpose of this Plan shall be deemed to include  employment by, and to
          continue  during any period in which an employee is in the  employment
          of, any subsidiary.

             Exhibit 10.29 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. 2003 Employee
                         Stock Option Plan (continued)

     (d)  No Rights as a  Shareholder.  An  optionee  shall  have no rights as a
          shareholder  with respect to shares covered by such optionee's  Option
          until the date of the  issuance  of shares  to the  optionee  upon the
          optionee's  exercise of the  Option.  No  adjustment  will be made for
          dividends or other  distributions  or rights for which the record date
          is prior to the date of such issuance.

     (e)  No Right to Corporate  Assets.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall be
          construed as giving any optionee, such optionee's beneficiaries or any
          other person any equity or other interest of any kind in any assets of
          the  Company or any  subsidiary  or  creating a trust of any kind or a
          fiduciary  relationship  of  any  kind  between  the  Company  or  any
          subsidiary  and any  such  person.  Any  optionee  shall  have  only a
          contractual  right to shares  of Stock as set forth in the  Agreement,
          unsecured by any assets of the Company or any subsidiary,  and nothing
          contained in the Plan shall  constitute a guarantee that the assets of
          the Company or any subsidiary  shall be sufficient to pay any benefits
          to any person.

     (f)  No  Restriction  on Corporate  Action.  Nothing  contained in the Plan
          shall be  construed  to prevent  the  Company or any  subsidiary  from
          taking  any  corporate  action  that is deemed by the  Company or such
          subsidiary to be appropriate or in its best interests,  whether or not
          such  action  would have an  adverse  effect on the Plan or any Option
          made under the Plan.  No optionee,  beneficiary  or other person shall
          have any claim  against the Company or any  subsidiary  as a result of
          any such action.

     (g)  Limitations on Transfer.  Except as designated by the optionee by will
          or by the laws of descent and distribution, neither an optionee nor an
          optionee's  beneficiary  shall  have  the  power  or  right  to  sell,
          exchange, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise encumber or dispose of
          such optionee's or  beneficiary's  interest  arising under the Plan or
          any Option received under the Plan, nor shall such interest be subject
          to seizure for the payment of an  Optionee's or  beneficiary's  debts,
          judgments,  alimony,  or separate  maintenance or be  transferable  by
          operation  of law in  the  event  of an  optionee's  or  beneficiary's
          bankruptcy or insolvency  and to the extent any such interest  arising
          under the Plan or an Option  received  under the Plan is  awarded to a
          spouse  pursuant to any divorce  proceeding,  such  interest  shall be
          deemed to be  terminated  and  forfeited  notwithstanding  any vesting
          provisions or other terms herein or in the agreement  evidencing  such
          Option.

     (h)  Application  of Funds.  The proceeds  received by the Company from the
          sale of shares of Stock pursuant to the Plan shall be used for general
          corporate purposes.

     (i)  Elections in Writing. Unless otherwise specified herein, each election
          required  or  permitted  to be made by any  optionee  or other  person
          entitled to benefits under the Plan,  and any permitted  modification,
          or  revocation  thereof,  shall be in writing at such  times,  in such
          form,  and  subject  to  such   restrictions  and   limitations,   not
          inconsistent  with  the  terms of the  Plan,  as the  Committee  shall
          require.

     (j)  Governing Law; Construction. All rights and obligations under the Plan
          shall be governed by, and the Plan shall be  construed  in  accordance
          with,  the  laws  of the  State  of  Missouri  without  regard  to the
          principles  of  conflicts  of laws.  Titles and  headings  to Sections
          herein are for purposes of reference  only, and shall in no way limit,
          define or  otherwise  affect  the  meaning  or  interpretation  of any
          provisions of the Plan.

          stock of the Company or reacquired shares of such common stock held in
          its treasury.

III. Administration.

     (a)  The Plan shall be  administered  by the Committee.  The members of the
          Committee shall be "Non-Employee Directors" within the meaning of Rule
          16b-3  Act,   provided,   however,   that   noncompliance   with  such
          qualifications  shall not  invalidate  any  grants of  Options  by the
          Committee.  Committee  members  may  resign at any time by  delivering
          written  notice to the  Board.  Vacancies  in the  Committee,  however
          caused,  shall be filled by the Board.  The  Committee  shall act by a
          majority of its members in office and the  Committee may act either by
          vote at a telephonic or other meeting or by a consent or other written
          instrument  signed  by all of the  members  of the  Committee.  If the
          Committee  does not exist,  or for any other reason  determined by the
          Board,  the  Board  mat take any  action  under  the Plan  that  would
          otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee.

     (b)  Subject to and not  inconsistent  with the express  provisions  of the
          Plan,  the Committee has and may exercise such powers and authority of
          the Board as may be  necessary  or  appropriate  for the  Committee to
          carry  out  its  functions  under  the  Plan.   Without  limiting  the
          generality of the foregoing,  the Committee  shall have full power and
          authority  (i) to determine all questions of fact that may arise under
          the  Plan,   (ii)  to  interpret  the  Plan  and  to  make  all  other
          determinations  necessary or advisable for the  administration  of the
          Plan and (iii) to prescribe,  amend and rescind rules and  regulations
          relating to the Plan,  including,  without limitation,  any rules that
          the Committee  determines  are necessary or appropriate to ensure that
          the Company  and the Plan will be able to comply  with all  applicable
          provisions  of  any  applicable  federal,  state  or  local  law.  All
          interpretations,  determinations  and actions by the Committee will be
          final and binding upon all persons,  including  the Company,  Eligible
          Directors and Optionees.

IV.  Shares Subject to the Plan.

     (a)  Subject to the provisions of Section 10 hereof, the Stock which may be
          issued  pursuant  to the  exercise of Options  granted  under the Plan
          shall not exceed in the aggregate  200,000  shares of Stock,  plus all
          shares  authorized  under  the 1993  Director  Stock  Option  Plan not
          covered by an option on the date such plan expires.

     (b)  At any time during the existence of the Plan,  there shall be reserved
          for issuance  upon the exercise of Options  granted  under the Plan an
          amount of Stock  (subject  to  adjustment  as  provided  in Section 10
          hereof) equal to the total number of share then  issuable  pursuant to
          all such Option  grants which shall have been made prior to such time.
          The Company in its discretion  may use  reacquired  shares held in the
          treasury in lieu of authorized but unissued shares.

     (c)  If an Option terminates, in whole or in part, by expiration or for any
          other reason  except  exercise of such Option,  the shares  previously
          reserved  for  issuance  upon  grant  of the  Option  shall  again  be
          available  for issuance as if such shares had never been subject to an
          Option.

V.  Granting of Options.

     (a)  Each  person who is an  Eligible  Director  on the  Option  Date shall
          receive  Options  to  acquire  10,000  shares  of Stock at a per share
          purchase  price equal to the per share Fair Market  Value of the Stock
          on the Option Date, provided,  however, that no grant shall be made to
          any Eligible  Director who is first  elected a director of the Company
          at the annual meeting of the  shareholders  immediately  preceding the
          Board meeting on the Option Date.

     (b)  Each Eligible  Director may also be granted  Options from time to time
          upon approval by the full Board.

     (c)  All  Options  granted  under the Plan shall be granted as of an Option
          Date.  Promptly  after each Option Date,  the Company shall notify the
          Optionee of the grant of the Option, and shall hand deliver or mail to
          the Optionee an Option  Agreement,  duly  executed by and on behalf of
          the Company, with the request that the Optionee execute and return the
          Option  Agreement  within  thirty days after the Option  Date.  If the
          Optionee shall fail to execute and return the written Option Agreement
          within  said   thirty-day   period,   his  or  her  Option   shall  be
          automatically terminated, except that if the Optionee dies within said
          thirty-day   period,   such  Option   Agreement   shall  be  effective
          notwithstanding the fact that it has not been signed prior to death.

     (d)  Options  granted  under the Plan will not be incentive  stock  options
          within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.

VI.  Terms of Options.

Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan, each Option shall be evidenced
by an Option Agreement, which shall include the substance of the following terms
and conditions:

     (a)  The option price for each share of Stock covered by an Option shall be
          an amount  equal to 100% of the Fair Market  Value of a share of Stock
          on the Option Date of such Option.

     (b)  The  Option by its terms  shall not be  transferable  by the  Optionee
          otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and  distribution  or
          pursuant to a  qualified  domestic  relations  order as defined by the
          Code or regulations thereunder.  The designation of a beneficiary does
          not constitute a transfer. The Option shall be exercisable, during the
          Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee.

     (c)  The Option by its terms shall be immediately  exercisable as to any or
          all shares and may be exercised at any time and from time to time.

     (d)  Each  Option  granted  under  the  Plan  and  all  unexercised  rights
          thereunder shall expire automatically upon the earlier of (i) the date
          on which an  Optionee  ceases  to hold  office  as a  director  of the
          Company for any reason  other than  retirement,  death or  disability,
          (ii) the date that is three months following the effective date of the
          Optionee's  retirement from service on the Board,  (iii) the date that
          is one year following the date on which the Optionee's  service on the
          Board of Directors of the Company  ceases due to death or  disability,
          and (iv) the seventh anniversary date of the Option date.

VII.  No Right to Remain a Director.

The grant of an Option  shall not  create any right in any person to remain as a
director of the Company.

VIII.  Exercise of Options.

     (a)  An Option may be exercised in whole or in part except as otherwise may
          be provided in the Option  Agreement,  by giving written notice to the
          Company  stating the number of shares of Stock for which the Option is
          being  exercised,  accompanied  by  payment  in full of the  aggregate
          purchase price for the shares of Stock being purchased. Payment of the
          aggregate  purchase  price for the  shares of Stock may be made (i) in
          cash or by check  payable and  acceptable  to the Company for the full
          amount of the  purchase  price of the shares with respect to which the
          Option is  exercised,  (ii) subject to the approval of the  Committee,
          upon  delivery to the  Company on the  exercise  date of  certificates
          representing  shares of Stock,  owned by the  Optionee for longer than
          six months and registered in the Optionee's name, having a Fair Market
          Value  on the date of such  exercise  and  delivery  equal to the full
          amount of the  purchase  price of the shares with respect to which the
          Option is  exercised,  (iii) at the  Optionee's  written  request  and
          subject to the approval of the Committee and to such  instructions  as
          the Committee  may specify,  in  accordance  with a cashless  exercise
          program pursuant to which the Company may deliver certificates for the
          shares of Stock for which the  Option is being  exercised  to a broker
          for sale on behalf of the  Optionee,  provided  that the  Optionee has
          irrevocably instructed such broker to remit directly to the Company on
          the Optionee's  behalf the full amount of such purchase price from the
          proceeds  of such  sale,  or (iv) a  combination  of (i) and (ii) that
          collectively  equals  the full  amount  of the  purchase  price of the
          shares with respect to which the Option is exercised.

     (b)  An  Optionee  shall  have  none of the  rights of a  shareholder  with
          respect to shares of Stock  subject to his or her Option  until shares
          of Stock  are  issued  to him or her upon the  exercise  of his or her
          Option.

IX.  General Provisions.

The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate for shares
of Stock to an Optionee upon the exercise of his or her Option:

     (a)  Prior to (i) if requested by the Company,  the filing with the Company
          by the  Optionee  or the  Optionee's  Post-Death  Representative  of a
          representation in writing that at the time of such exercise that it is
          his or her then present intention to acquire the shares of Stock being
          purchased  for  investment  and  not  for  resale,   and/or  (ii)  the
          completion of any  registration or other  qualification of such shares
          of Stock  under any state or  federal  securities  laws or  rulings or
          regulations  of any  governmental  regulatory  body which the  Company
          shall determine to be necessary or advisable; and

     (b)  Unless such issuance or delivery would comply with all applicable laws
          and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange, the NASDAQ
          or similar entity.

X.  Adjustment Provisions.

     (a)  The existence of the Plan and the Options granted  hereunder shall not
          affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the  shareholders
          of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment,  recapitalization,
          reorganization  or other change in the Company's  capital structure or
          its business,  any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into
          another entity, any issuance of bonds, debentures,  preferred or prior

          thereof, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company for any sale or
          transfer  of all or any part of its assets or  business,  or any other

             Exhibit 10.30 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. 2003 Director
                          Stock Option Plan (continued)

     (b)  The shares with respect to which  Options may be granted are shares of
          Stock as presently constituted. If, however, the number of outstanding
          shares  of Stock  are  increased  or  decreased,  or such  shares  are
          exchanged  for a different  number or kind of shares or  securities of
          the  Company  through  a  reorganization,   merger,  recapitalization,
          reclassification,  stock  dividend,  stock split,  number of shares of
          Stock  subject to the Plan as  provided  in Section 4 hereof,  and the
          shares of Stock subject to issuance  under  outstanding  Options under
          the Plan shall be appropriately  and  proportionately  adjusted by the
          Committee.  Any such adjustment in an outstanding Option shall be made
          without  change in the  aggregate  purchase  price  applicable  to the
          unexercised  portion of the Option but with an appropriate  adjustment
          in the price for each share or other unit of any  security  covered by
          the Option.

     (c)  Except  as may  otherwise  be  expressly  provided  in the  Plan,  the
          issuance  by the  Company of shares of  capital  stock of any class or
          securities  convertible  into shares of capital stock of any class for
          cash, property, labor or services, upon direct sale, upon the exercise
          of rights or warrants to subscribe  therefor,  or upon  conversion  of
          shares or obligations of the Company  convertible  into such shares of
          capital  stock or other  securities,  and in any case  such  shares of
          capital stock or other securities,  and in any case whether or not for
          fair value,  shall not affect,  and no  adjustment  by reason  thereof
          shall be made with respect to, the number of shares of Stock available
          under  the Plan or  subject  to  Options  theretofore  granted  or the
          purchase price per share with respect to outstanding Options.

     (d)  Adjustments  under  this  Section  10 be made by the  Committee  whose
          determination  as to what  adjustments  shall be made,  and the extent
          thereof, shall be final, binding and conclusive.  No fractional shares
          of Stock shall be issued under the Plan or in connection with any such
          adjustment.

     (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10,
          upon:  (i) the  dissolution  or  liquidation  of the  Company,  (ii) a
          reorganization,  merger or  consolidation  of the Company  with one or
          more   corporations   in  which  the  Company  is  not  the  surviving
          corporation, or (iii) a sale of substantially all of the assets of the
          Company, the Plan shall terminate, and any outstanding Options granted
          under the Plan shall  terminate on the day before the  consummation of
          the transaction; provided that the Committee shall have the right, but
          not the obligation, to accelerate the time in which any Options may be
          exercised  prior to such a termination.  However,  the  termination of
          such  Options  shall  not occur if  provision  is made in  writing  in
          connection  with  the  transaction,  in a  manner  acceptable  to  the
          Committee,  for: (A) the  continuance  of the Plan and  assumption  of
          outstanding  Options,  (B) the  substitution  for such  Options of new
          options to purchase the stock of a successor corporation (or parent or
          subsidiary  thereof),  with  appropriate  adjustments as to number and
          kind of shares and option price, or (C) other treatment of the Options
          acceptable to the Committee. The Committee shall have the authority to
          amend this  paragraph  to provide for a  requirement  that a successor
          corporation assume any outstanding Options.

XI.  Duration, Amendment and Termination.

     (a)  The Board may at any time  terminate the Plan or make such  amendments
          thereof as it shall deem  advisable  and in the best  interests of the
          Company, without further action on the part of the shareholders of the
          Company;  provided,  however,  that no such  termination  or amendment
          shall, without the consent of the Optionee, adversely affect or impair
          the rights of such Optionee,  and provided further,  that no amendment
          requiring  shareholder  approval in order to meet the  requirements of
          Rule 16b-3  shall be  effective  unless such  shareholder  approval is
          obtained,  and  provided,  further  that the  provisions  relating  to
          eligible  persons,  the  amount  and price of awards and the timing of
          awards  may not be amended  more than once every six months  except to
          comport  with changes in the Code or the  Employee  Retirement  Income
          Security Act of 1974, or the rules  thereunder.  (b) The period during
          which Options may be granted under the Plan shall  terminate on May 6,
          2013,  unless the Plan earlier shall have been  terminated as provided
          above.

The Company shall have the right to deduct from  payments of any kind  otherwise
due to the Optionee any  federal,  state or local taxes of any kind  required by
law to be withheld  with respect to any shares  issued upon  exercise of Options
under the Plan.

XIII.  Shareholder Approval.

The Plan shall become  effective  upon adoption by the Board and approval by the
Company's shareholders; provided, however, that prior to approval of the Plan by
the  Company's  shareholders  but after  adoption  by the Board,  Options may be
granted under the Plan subject to obtaining such approval.

                 Exhibit 10.34 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Code
                         of Business Conduct and Ethics

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

This Code of  Business  Conduct  and  Ethics  (this  "Code")  provides a general
statement of the Company's  expectations  regarding the ethical  standards  that
each  director,  officer and team member should adhere to while acting on behalf
of the Company.  This Code  contains  compliance  standards  and  procedures  to
facilitate its effectiveness  and to ensure a prompt and consistent  response to
violations.  Each  director,  officer,  and team  member is required to read and
become  familiar  with the ethical  standards  described in this Code. It is not
intended  to and  does  not in any way  constitute  an  employment  contract  or
assurance  of  continued  employment,  and does not  create  any  rights  in any
director, officer, team member, client, supplier, competitor, stockholder or any
other person or entity.

The highest business and ethical standards mandate  accountability for adherence
to this Code. Accordingly, any conduct or action that violates this Code will be
subject to disciplinary action, which may include immediate termination

Administration

The  Corporate  Governance/Nominating  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  of
O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc.  (the  "Company"),  referred  to in this Code as the
Governing  Body, is  responsible  for setting the standards of business  conduct
contained in this Code and updating these  standards as it deems  appropriate to
reflect changes in the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Company,
the business practices within the Company's industry, the Company's own business
practices,  and the prevailing ethical standards of the communities in which the
Company  operates.  The Company's  Internal  Auditor will act as the  Compliance
Officer and will  oversee the  procedures  designed  to  implement  this Code to
ensure that they are operating effectively.  It is the individual responsibility
of each  director,  officer  and team  member of the Company to comply with this
Code.

Conflicts of Interest

All  directors,  officers and team members of the Company  should be diligent in
avoiding a conflict of interest with regard to Company's  interests.  A conflict
of interest  exists when there is a conflict (or even an appearance of conflict)
between  an  individual's  personal  interests,   financial  or  otherwise,   or
professional  interests,  and his or her fiduciary obligations to the Company. A
conflict  situation  can arise when a  director,  officer or team  member  takes
actions or has  interests  that may make it difficult to perform his or her work
objectively  and  effectively.  Conflicts  of  interest  may also  arise  when a
director,  officer or team  member,  or a member of his or her family,  receives
improper  personal  benefits as a result of his or her  position in the Company,
whether received from the Company or third party. Federal law prohibits loans by
the  Company to its  directors  and  executive  officers.  It is a  conflict  of
interest  for a Company  team member to work  simultaneously  for a  competitor,
customer, or supplier. In addition, directors, officers and team members are not
allowed to work for a competitor as a consultant or board member.

Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except under
guidelines  approved by the  Corporate  Governance/Nominating  Committee  of the
Board of Directors.  Where there is an actual or potential  conflict of interest
or  perception of a conflict of interest,  the director,  officer or team member
must make full  disclosure and must not participate in the matter giving rise to
the conflict. Such person may, in accordance with such procedures, refrain or be
asked to refrain from  participating  and/or  making  decisions  concerning  any
business  that is related to the matter in which there is an actual or potential
conflict of interest.

Any director, officer or team member who becomes aware of a conflict of interest
or  potential  conflict  of interest  should  bring it to the  attention  of the
Compliance  Officer,  a supervisor,  manager or other  appropriate  personnel or
consult the  procedures  discussed  in this Code.  Directors,  officers and team
members who  knowingly  fail to disclose  conflicts  of interest  are subject to
disciplinary action, including dismissal or removal from office.

                Exhibit 10.34 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Code of
                    Business Conduct and Ethics (continued)

Corporate Opportunities

No  director,  officer  or team  member  may:  (a) take for  himself  or herself
personally  opportunities  that  are  discovered  through  the  use  of  Company
property,  information  or position;  (b) use Company  property,  information or
position for personal gain; or (c) compete with the Company. Directors, officers
and team members owe a duty of loyalty to the Company,  and must be committed to
advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality (Protecting Company Information)

All directors,  officers and team members must maintain the  confidentiality  of
confidential  information  entrusted  to  them  by  the  Company,  its  business
partners,  suppliers,  customers or others  related to the  Company's  business.
Confidential  information  includes all non-public  information that might be of
use to  competitors or harmful to the Company,  or its customers,  if disclosed.
Typical of such  information  are  business,  research,  and new product  plans;
objectives  and  strategies;  trade  secrets;  unpublished  financial or pricing
information;  processes and  formulas;  computer  programs;  salary and benefits
data;  team member  medical  information;  team member,  customer,  and supplier
lists. Disclosure of confidential  information violates Company policy and could
result in  disciplinary  action,  except  when  authorized  by legal  counsel as
required by laws, regulations or legal proceedings.  If any director, officer or
team member  believes  they have a legal  obligation  to  disclose  confidential
information, they should consult the Company's legal counsel.

Any  Company  information  created  in the course of  employment  belongs to the
Company.  Team members  leaving the Company must return all written  proprietary
information  in their  possession.  A team  member's  obligation  to protect the
Company's  proprietary and confidential  information  continues even after he or
she leaves the Company.

Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets

Safeguarding Company assets is the responsibility of all directors, officers and
team  members.  All  directors,  officers  and team members  should  protect the
Company's assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness,  and waste
have a direct impact on the Company's  profitability.  Any suspected incident of
fraud  or  theft  should  be  immediately  reported  for  investigation  to  the
Compliance  Officer.  All Company assets should be used for legitimate  business
purposes. The personal use of Company assets without permission is prohibited.

Fair Dealing

The Company  considers its reputation for integrity and fairness one of its most
valuable assets.  Each director,  officer and team member shall endeavor to deal
fairly  and in good  faith  with the  Company's  customers,  stockholders,  team
members, suppliers,  regulators,  business partners,  competitors and others. We
seek to outperform  our  competition  fairly and honestly.  We seek  competitive
advantages  through  superior  performance,  never through  unethical or illegal
business  practices.  No  director,  officer or team  member  shall take  unfair
advantage of anyone through  manipulation,  concealment,  abuse of privileged or
confidential  information,  misrepresentation,  fraudulent behavior,  possessing
trade  secret  information  that was  obtained  without the  owner's  consent or
through any other  unfair  dealing  practice.  No actions  shall be taken by any
Company  director,   officer  or  team  member,  which  could  undermine  proper
relationships or tarnish the Company's reputation or integrity.

Occasionally  our customers or suppliers  may offer gifts to team members.  Such
gifts  are  known  as  "gratuities"  and are  generally  offered  as a means  of
influencing a team member's  business  conduct in some way or influencing his or
her opinion/ relationship with them as a supplier.  Our definition of gratuities
includes,  but is not limited to, items for  personal use such as money,  gifts,
merchandise, trips, sporting event tickets, meals, etc.


                   O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                Exhibit 10.34 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Code of
                    Business Conduct and Ethics (continued)

The  Company  realizes  that  during the  normal  course of  business  it may be
customary to accept business-related items of incidental value ($20 or less). We
have therefore  defined  acceptable and unacceptable  behavior when dealing with
gratuities  as follows:  Acceptable  -  Promotional  items and gifts such as ink
pens, caps,  calendars,  hats, an occasional business related meal, etc., all of
approximate value of $20 or less.

Unacceptable  -  money,  apparel,  gifts,  merchandise,  trips,  sporting  event
tickets, golf outings,  meals including spouse, social meals, etc., with a value
of more than $20.  In the event a gratuity  is  offered  by a supplier  which is
categorized as unacceptable,  the information  concerning the gratuity should be
reported according to the Compliance Procedures detailed in this Code.

If it is  determined  the  gratuity  can be used to benefit  our  business,  the
gratuity will be accepted and used  according to normal  company  procedure.  No
gratuity  categorized as unacceptable shall be accepted prior to approval of the
Compliance Officer or the Governing Body.

Sample  merchandise  obtained for product evaluation during the normal course of
business should be sold as inventory when the evaluation is complete. This would
also apply to premium  items.  At no time is it acceptable  to request  specific
application  samples for personal  use. New products or materials  needing to be
"tested"  on a  personal  vehicle  must  be  approved  according  to  the  above
procedures and coordinated by a product manager.  The results should be reported
to the Product Review Board.

All  gratuities  must  be  reported.  At the end of each  month  during  which a
gratuity of any type is accepted,  it is the  responsibility  of the team member
accepting  the  gratuity to complete a Gratuities  Report.  The  completed  form
should be sent to the Compliance Officer.

Failure to abide by this  policy is grounds  for  disciplinary  action up to and
including termination.

The U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  prohibits  giving  anything of value
directly or indirectly to officials of foreign  governments or foreign political
candidates  in order to obtain or retain  business.  In  addition,  the promise,
offer or delivery to an  official  or team  member of the U.S.  Government  of a
gift, favor or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate
Company  policy  but  could  also  be  a  criminal  offense.   State  and  local
governments,  as well as foreign  governments,  may have similar  rules.  Please
consult the Compliance  Officer to obtain guidance from Company legal counsel in
this area. The Board shall have an independent  director  designated as the Lead
Independent  Director,  who  shall  preside  at the  executive  sessions  of the
independent  directors and shall be responsible for  coordinating the activities
of the other  independent  directors.  The Lead Independent  Director shall have
such other authority, responsibilities and duties as determined by the Board.

Compliance with Laws, Rules, and Regulations

The Company  expects all directors,  officers and team members of the Company to
comply in all respects with the laws and regulations  that apply to its business
at all government levels. In addition,  the Company requires that its directors,
officers and team members comply with  work-place  policies and applicable  laws
and  regulations.  Although not all team members are expected to know details of
all laws, it is important to recognize when to seek advice from supervisors.

This Code does not summarize all laws,  rules and regulations  applicable to the
Company  and its  directors,  officers  and team  members.  Please  consult  the
Compliance  Officer for various  guidelines the Company has prepared on specific
laws,  rules and  regulations,  or to obtain further guidance from the Company's
legal counsel.

                    Business Conduct and Ethics (continued)

Accurate and Timely Periodic Reports

The Company is committed  to  providing  investors  with full,  fair,  accurate,
timely and understandable disclosure in the periodic reports that it is required
to file with, or submit to, the Securities  Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") and
in other public  communications made by the Company as a public company. To this
end, the Company shall:

- -    Comply with generally accepted accounting principles at all times;

- -    Maintain  a system  of  internal  accounting  controls  that  will  provide
     reasonable  assurances to  management  that all  transactions  are properly
     recorded;

- -    Maintains books and records that accurately  reflect and fairly reflect the
     Company's transactions;

- -    Prohibit  the  establishment  of any  undisclosed  or  unrecorded  funds or
     assets;

- -    Maintain  a system  of  internal  controls  that  will  provide  reasonable
     assurances to management  that  material  information  about the Company is
     made known to  management,  particularly  during  the  periods in which the
     Company's periodic reports are being prepared; and

- -    Present  information  in a clear and  orderly  manner  and avoid the use of
     legal and financial jargon in the Company's periodic reports.

No action may be taken by any director or officer (or other person  acting under
the direction thereof) to fraudulently influence,  coerce, manipulate or mislead
the  Company's  independent  auditor for the purpose of rendering  the Company's
financial statements materially misleading

The Company  considers its disclosure  obligation to be of critical  importance.
Depending on his or her position with the Company,  a director,  officer or team
member  may be  asked  to  provide  necessary  information  to  assure  that the
Company's  public  reports are complete,  fair and  understandable.  The Company
takes it's public  reporting very seriously and expects its directors,  officers
and team members to provide  prompt answers to inquiries by it related to public
disclosure requirements.

Accounting Complaints

The Company's  policy is to comply with all applicable  financial  reporting and
accounting  regulations  applicable to the Company. If any director,  officer or
team member of the Company has  concerns or  complaints  regarding  questionable
accounting or auditing  matters of the Company,  then he or she is encouraged to
submit those concerns or complaints  (anonymously,  confidentially or otherwise)
to the Audit  Committee  of the Board of Directors  (which will,  subject to its
duties arising under applicable law,  regulations and legal  proceedings,  treat
such submissions  confidentially) according to the procedures established by the
Audit  Committee.  Such  submissions  may be  directed to the  attention  of the
Compliance  Officer,  the Audit Committee or any director who is a member of the
Audit Committee, at the principal executive offices of the Company.

Insider Trading

Directors, officers and team members who have access to confidential information
are not permitted to use or share that  information  for stock trading  purposes
for any  other  purpose  except in the  conduct  of our  business  and in strict
compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  SEC  regulations.  All  non-public
information about the Company should be considered confidential information.  To
use non-public information for personal financial benefit or to "tip" others who
might make an investment  decision on the basis of this  information is not only
unethical but also illegal. No director,  officer, or team member of the Company
may buy or sell  securities  of the  Company  when in  possession  of  "material
non-public  information."  Directors,  officers and team members are required to
comply  with  the  Company's  Insider  Trading  Policy,   copies  of  which  are
distributed to all  directors,  officers and team members and are available from
the Compliance Officer.

                Exhibit 10.34 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Code of
                    Business Conduct and Ethics (continued)

Records Retention; Books and Accounts

Directors,  officers and team members are expected to become  familiar  with the
Company's  policies on record  retention.  All of the Company's books,  records,
accounts and financial  statements  must be  maintained in reasonable  detail to
appropriately  reflect  the  Company's  transactions  and must  conform  both to
applicable legal  requirements and to the Company's system of internal controls.
Unrecorded  or "off the books"  funds or assets,  i.e.  "off the balance  sheet"
transactions,  should not be maintained  unless  permitted by applicable  law or
regulation

The Company requires honest and accurate  recording and reporting of information
in order to make  responsible  business  decisions.  For example,  only true and
actual numbers of hours worked should be reported.  Many team members  regularly
use business expense accounts, which must be documented and recorded accurately.

Records should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company's record
retention policies.

Reporting of Illegal or Unethical Behavior

The Company's  business and  reputation  depends,  in large  measure,  on strict
adherence  to the  provisions  of this Code.  Every  director,  officer and team
member is  encouraged  and  obligated  to report  any  known or  suspected  Code
violations to the Governing  Body,  supervisors,  managers or other  appropriate
counsel.

The Company will  investigate  any matter so reported  and may take  appropriate
disciplinary and corrective action, up to and including termination. The Company
forbids  retaliation  of any kind against team members who report  violations of
this Code or other illegal or unethical conduct.

Compliance Procedures

Directors,  officers and team members who are concerned that  violations of this
Code or that other illegal or unethical  conduct by directors,  officers or team
members  of  the  Company  have  occurred  or may  occur  should  contact  their
supervisor.  If for any reason,  anyone is unable to approach  their  supervisor
about their concerns or complaints,  then they may contact either the Compliance
Officer  or any member of the  Corporate  Governance/Nominating  Committee.  All
reports of  concerns  or  complaints  shall  remain  confidential  to the extent
necessary, subject to applicable law, regulation or legal proceeding.

Waivers

The  provisions of this Code may be waived for  directors or executive  officers
only by a resolution of the Company's independent  directors.  The provisions of
this Code may be waived for team  members  who are not  directors  or  executive
officers  by the  Compliance  Officer.  Any  waiver  of this Code  granted  to a
director or  executive  officer  will be publicly  disclosed  as required by the
federal  securities laws and the applicable  rules and regulations of the SEC or
the securities  exchange or  association  on which the Company's  securities are
listed for trading.

Political Contribution

Directors,  officers and team members are free to  contribute  to  candidates or
otherwise  partake in the political  process in their individual  capacity.  All
team members must avoid  discussing with  [decision-makers]  any matters pending
before courts or agencies  affecting the Company  unless the team member is part
of the  Company's  legal  counsel or obtains  the written  authorization  of the
Company to do so.



                   O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                Exhibit 10.34 - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Code of
                    Business Conduct and Ethics (continued)

The  Company is  committed  to  maintaining  goodwill  and to being a good civic
neighbor. Directors, officers and team members are encouraged to serve on boards
of non-profit  organizations and in other volunteer  capacities.  However,  if a
director,  officer  or team  member  serves in any  capacity  with a  non-profit
organization,   such  person  may  not  represent  either  the  Company  or  the
organization in any transaction between them.

No Company funds or assets will be loaned or contributed to any political  party
or  organization,  or to any  individual  who holds or is a candidate for public
office,  except when permitted by applicable law and prior written authorization
is obtained from the Company.  The following are examples of  activities,  which
are illegal  under  federal  law and the laws of those  states,  which  prohibit
corporate political contributions:

- -    Contributions  by a team member  which are  reimbursed  by Company  through
     expense accounts or in other ways;

- -    Purchase by Company of tickets for political dinners or fundraising events;

- -    Contributions in kind, such as loaning team members to political parties or
     providing company airplanes for use in political campaigns;

- -    Indirect contributions by Company through suppliers, customers or agents.

Political contributions by corporations are permitted by the laws of some states
and foreign  countries.  Such  allowable  contributions  may include some of the
activities mentioned above, but in all cases, require prior authorization of the
Compliance Officer and, when required by the law, by the Governing Body.

This policy is not intended to discourage or prevent a team member from engaging
in political  activities  as an  individual on his or her own time and at his or
her own expense. It also does not prohibit the team member from making political
contributions  from  personal  funds or from  expressing  individual  views with
respect to legislative or political matters.

Other Company Policies

All  directors and team members  should be familiar with the Company's  existing
Insider  Trading Policy and other policies  regarding the rights and obligations
of the Company's team members,  which may amplify and expand on certain  matters
addressed in this Code.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion of our financial condition,  results of operations
and  liquidity  and capital  resources  should be read in  conjunction  with our
consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information
included elsewhere in this annual report.

     We are one of the largest  specialty  retailers of  automotive  aftermarket
parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the United States, selling
our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional installers.
Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and  remanufactured
automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories, and a complete line of
auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service
equipment.

     We calculate  same-store product sales based on the change in product sales
for  stores  open at least  one  year.  Prior to  January  2000,  we  calculated
same-store  product  sales  based on the change in  product  sales of only those
stores open during both full periods being compared. We calculate the percentage
increase in same-store product sales based on store sales results, which exclude
sales of specialty machinery, sales by outside salesmen and sales to employees.

     Cost of goods sold  consists  primarily of product  costs and warehouse and
distribution  expenses.  Cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales may
be  affected by  variations  in our product  mix,  price  changes in response to
competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs.

     Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expenses consist primarily
of salaries  and  benefits  for store and  corporate  team  members,  occupancy,
advertising  expenses,  general and  administrative  expenses,  data processing,
professional expenses and other related expenses.

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The  fundamental   objective  of  financial   reporting  is  to  provide  useful
information  that allows a reader to comprehend  the business  activities of our
company. To aid in that  understanding,  management has identified our "critical
accounting  policies."  These  policies  have  the  potential  to  have  a  more
significant  impact  on  our  financial   statements,   either  because  of  the
significance  of the financial  statement item to which they relate,  or because
they  require  judgment  and  estimation  due to  the  uncertainty  involved  in
measuring, at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature.

o    Cost of goods sold - Cost of goods sold includes warehouse and distribution
     expenses and estimates of amounts due from vendors for certain  merchandise
     allowances  and rebates.  These  estimates are consistent  with  historical
     experience.

o    Operating, selling, general and administrative expense (OSG&A) - Operating,
     selling, general and administrative expense includes estimates for medical,
     worker's  compensation and other general liability  obligations,  which are
     partially  based  on  estimates  of  certain  claim  costs  and  historical
     experience.

o    Accounts receivable - Allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on
     historical  loss  ratios  and  consistently  has been  within  management's
     expectations.

o    Revenue -  Over-the-counter  retail  sales are  recorded  when the customer
     takes  possession of merchandise.  Sales to professional  installers,  also
     referred  to  as  "commercial   sales",   are  recorded  upon  delivery  of
     merchandise to the customer, generally at the customer's place of business.
     Wholesale sales to other retailers,  also referred to as "jobber sales" are
     recorded  upon  shipment  of  merchandise.  All sales are  recorded  net of
     estimated allowances and discounts.

o    Vendor  concessions  - The Company  receives  concessions  from its vendors
     through a variety of  programs  and  arrangements,  including  co-operative
     advertising,  devaluation  programs,  allowances  for warranties and volume
     purchase rebates.  Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental
     to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable
     for accounting  purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense
     in  the  period  in  which  the  advertising  occurred.  All  other  vendor
     concessions  are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized
     in the consolidated statement of income.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES (CONTINUED)

o    Stock-based  compensation  - We have  elected  to use the  intrinsic  value
     method of accounting  for stock options issued under our stock option plans
     and  accordingly  do not record an  expense  for such  stock  options.  For
     purposes  of pro  forma  disclosures  under  the  fair  value  method,  the
     estimated  fair value of the  options  is  amortized  to  expense  over the
     options'  vesting  period.  Our pro forma  information  for the years ended
     December 31, is as follows:



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth, certain income statement data as a percentage of
product sales for the years indicated:

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

2003 Compared to 2002

     Product sales increased $199.3 million, or 15.2% from $1.31 billion in 2002
to $1.51  billion in 2003,  primarily  due to 128 net  additional  stores opened
during 2003, and a 7.8% increase in same-store  product sales for stores open at
least one year.  We believe that the  increased  product  sales  achieved by the
existing  stores  are the  result  of our  offering  of a broader  selection  of
products in most stores, an increased promotional and advertising effort through
a variety of media and localized  promotional events, and continued  improvement
in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores. Also, our continued focus
on serving professional installers contributed to increased product sales.

     Gross profit  increased  15.4% from $553.4 million (42.2% of product sales)
in 2002 to $638.3  million  (42.2% of product  sales) in 2003.  The  increase in
gross profit dollars is due to the increase in product sales.

     Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expenses (OSG&A) increased
$58.0  million from $415.1  million  (31.6% of product  sales) in 2002 to $473.1
million  (31.3% of product  sales) in 2003.  The  increase in these  expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits,
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations. The decrease in OSG&A expenses as
a percent of product sales was primarily due to achieving  greater  economies of
scale resulting from increased  product sales and through  management's  expense
control initiatives.

     Other expense,  net, decreased by $2.1 million from $7.3 million in 2002 to
$5.2 million in 2003.  The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest
expense  as a result of lower  average  borrowings  under the  Company's  credit
facility and to a lesser extent lower average interest rates.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $49.0  million in 2002 (37.4%
effective  tax rate) to $60.0 million in 2003 (37.5%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes.

     Principally  as a result of the  foregoing,  net  income in 2003 was $100.1
million (6.6% of product sales), an increase of $18.1 million or 22.1%, from net
income in 2002 of $82.0 million (6.3% of product sales).

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

2002 Compared to 2001

     Product sales increased $220.4 million, or 20.2% from $1.09 billion in 2001
to $1.31 billion in 2002, due to 106 net  additional  stores opened during 2002,
and a 3.7%  increase in  same-store  product  sales for stores open at least one
year.  We believe  that the  increased  product  sales  achieved by the existing
stores are the result of our offering of a broader selection of products in most
stores,  an increased  promotional and  advertising  effort through a variety of
media  and  localized  promotional  events,  and  continued  improvement  in the
merchandising  and store layouts of most stores.  Also,  our continued  focus on
serving professional installers contributed to increased product sales.

     Gross profit  increased  18.3% from $467.8 million (42.8% of product sales)
in 2001 to $553.4  million  (42.2% of product  sales) in 2002.  The  increase in
gross  profit  dollars is primarily  due to increases in sales.  The decrease in
gross profit as a percent of product sales is primarily due to increased product
sales to independent  jobbers,  which are at a lower gross margin, and increased
distribution   costs  at  the  distribution   centers  acquired  from  Mid-State
Automotive Distributors, Inc.

     Operating,  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses increased $61.1
million from $354.0  million  (32.4% of product sales) in 2001 to $415.1 million
(31.6% of product  sales) in 2002.  The  increase  in these  expenses  in dollar
amount was primarily  attributable to increased salaries and benefits,  rent and
other costs  associated with the addition of employees and facilities to support
the  increased  level of our  operations.  The  decrease in OSG&A  expenses as a
percent of product sales was  primarily  due to reductions in payroll,  benefits
and other OSG&A expenses through management's expense control initiatives.

     Other expense, net, increased by $215,000 from $7.1 million in 2001 to $7.3
million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased
borrowings under our credit facility and a decrease in interest income.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $40.4  million in 2001 (37.8%
effective  tax rate) to $49.0 million in 2002 (37.4%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to changes in
the mix of business between the states in which we operate.

     Principally  as a result  of the  foregoing,  net  income in 2002 was $82.0
million (6.3% of product sales), an increase of $15.6 million or 23.6%, from net
income in 2001 of $66.4 million (6.1% of product sales).

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Net cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was $172.8  million in 2003,
$104.5  million in 2002 and $50.0 million in 2001. The increase in cash provided
by operating  activities in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to increases
in  net  income,  accounts  payable,   accrued  payroll,  accrued  benefits  and
withholdings,  partially  offset by increases in receivables and inventory.  The
increase in accounts  payable was  primarily  due to  management's  efforts with
vendors to extend  the terms of  payment.  The  increases  in  accrued  payroll,
benefits and withholdings, accounts receivable and inventory primarily relate to
the increased level of our operations.

     The increase in cash  provided by operating  activities in 2002 compared to
2001 was  primarily  due to increases in net income,  accounts  payable,  income
taxes payable, accrued payroll and accrued benefits and withholdings,  partially
offset by  increases  in  receivables  and  inventory.  These  increases  relate
primarily to the increased level of our operations.

     Net cash used in investing  activities was $134.6  million in 2003,  $105.4
million  in 2002  and  $77.8  million  in 2001.  The  increase  in cash  used in
investing  activities in 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to increased  purchases
of property and equipment.

     On December 29, 2000, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction.  Under the
terms of the transaction,  we sold 90 properties,  including land, buildings and
improvements, which generated $52.3 million of additional cash. The lease, which
is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term
of 21  years  and  may be  extended  for one  initial  ten-year  period  and two
additional  successive  periods of five years each.  The resulting  gain of $4.5
million has been  deferred and is being  amortized  over the initial lease term.
Net rent  expense  during the initial  term will be  approximately  $5.5 million
annually  and  is  included  in  the  table  of  contractual  obligations  under
non-cancelable operating leases.

     On May 16,  2001,  we  completed a $100  million  private  placement of two
series of unsecured senior notes (Senior Notes).  The Series 2001-A Senior Notes
were issued for $75 million,  are due May 16, 2006,  and bear  interest at 7.72%
per year.  The Series 2001-B  Senior Notes were issued for $25 million,  are due
May 16,  2008,  and bear  interest  at 7.92% per  year.  The  private  placement
agreement  allows for a total of $200 million of Senior Notes issuable in series
and is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries. Proceeds from the transaction were
used  to  reduce  outstanding  borrowings  under  our  former  revolving  credit
facility.

     In August 2001, we completed a sale-leaseback with O'Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC
(an entity  owned by  certain  shareholders  of the  Company).  The  transaction
involved the sale and  leaseback of nine O'Reilly Auto Parts stores and resulted
in approximately $5.6 million of additional cash to the Company. The transaction
did not result in a material gain or loss.  The lease,  which has been accounted
for as an  operating  lease,  calls for an  initial  term of 15 years with three
five-year renewal options.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

     On June 26, 2003, we completed an amended and restated master  agreement to
our  $50  million  Synthetic  Operating  Lease  Facility  (the  Facility  or the
Synthetic  Lease)  with a group  of  financial  institutions.  The  terms of the
Facility  provide for an initial  lease period of five years,  a residual  value
guarantee of  approximately  $44.2  million at December  31, 2003,  and purchase
options on the  properties.  The Facility also contains a provision for an event
of default  whereby the lessor,  among other things,  may require us to purchase
any or all of the properties. One additional renewal period of five years may be
requested  from the lessor,  although the lessor is not  obligated to grant such
renewal.  The Facility has been  accounted  for as an operating  lease under the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  13 and  related  interpretations,  including
Financial  Interpretation  No. 46. Future minimum rental  commitments  under the
Facility have been included in the table of contractual obligations below.

     Capital  expenditures  were $136.5 million in 2003,  $102.3 million in 2002
and $68.5 million in 2001.  These  expenditures  were  primarily  related to the
opening of new  stores,  as well as the  relocation  or  remodeling  of existing
stores.  We either opened or acquired 128, 106 and 203 net stores in 2003,  2002
and 2001, respectively. We remodeled or relocated 46 stores and two distribution
centers in 2003, 27 stores in 2002 and 16 stores in 2001. Three new distribution
centers were  acquired;  one in 2003,  located  near Mobile,  Alabama and two in
October 2001, located in Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee.

     Our  continuing  store  expansion  program  requires   significant  capital
expenditures  and working capital  principally for inventory  requirements.  Our
2004 growth plans call for approximately 140 new stores and capital expenditures
of $125 million to $135 million.  The costs associated with the opening of a new
store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, inventory
and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately  $900,000 to $1.1
million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather
than purchase,  the store site.  Although the cost to acquire the business of an
independently  owned parts store varies,  depending primarily upon the amount of
inventory  and the amount,  if any, of real estate being  acquired,  we estimate
that the average  cost to acquire  such a business  and convert it to one of our
stores is  approximately  $400,000.  We plan to finance  our  expansion  program
through cash expected to be provided  from  operating  activities  and available
borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

     On July 29, 2002, the Company completed an unsecured, three-year syndicated
credit  facility  (Credit  Facility)  in the amount of $150 million led by Wells
Fargo Bank as the Administrative Agent,  replacing a five-year syndicated credit
facility.  The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of our  subsidiaries and may
be increased to a total of $200  million,  subject to the  availability  of such
additional credit from either existing banks within the Credit Facility or other
banks.  The Credit  Facility  bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from
0.875% to 1.375% (2.06% at December 31, 2003 and 2.26% at December 31, 2002) and
expires in July 2005.  At December  31, 2003 and 2002,  $20.0  million and $90.0
million,  respectively,  of the Credit Facility was  outstanding.  Additionally,
letters of credit  totaling  $11.0 million and $6.0 million were  outstanding at
December  31,  2003  and  2002,   respectively.   Accordingly,   our   aggregate
availability  for  additional  borrowings  under the Credit  Facility was $119.0
million and $54.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Prior to
July 29, 2002, the Company had available an unsecured credit facility  providing
for  maximum  borrowings  of $140  million.  The  facility  was  comprised  of a
revolving credit facility of $125 million,  and a term loan of $15 million.  The
credit  facility,  which bore  interest at LIBOR plus 0.50%,  expired in January
2003. All borrowings outstanding under the old credit facility were fully repaid
in July 2002.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

     We have utilized various financial instruments from time to time as sources
of cash when such  instruments  provided  a cost  effective  alternative  to our
existing sources of cash. We do not believe,  however,  that we are dependent on
the availability of these  instruments to fund our working capital  requirements
or our growth plans.

     We  completed  two  sale-leaseback  transactions  in 2000  and 2001 and the
Synthetic  Lease in 2000,  the terms of all of which are  described  above under
Liquidity and Capital Resources. The purpose of the sale-leaseback  transactions
was to reduce outstanding borrowings under our former revolving credit facility.
The purpose of the  Synthetic  Lease was to fund a portion of our store  growth,
primarily in 2001 and 2002.

     We issue  stand-by  letters of credit  provided by a $20  million  sublimit
under the Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings. These letters of
credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation,
general  liability  and  other  insurance  policies.  Substantially  all  of the
outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance and
have been issued to replace surety bonds that were previously issued. Letters of
credit totaling $11.0 million and $6.0 million were  outstanding at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Contractual Obligations

     Our  contractual  obligations,  including  commitments  for future payments
under   non-cancelable   lease   arrangements  and  short-  and  long-term  debt
arrangements,  are summarized  below and are fully disclosed in Notes 5 and 6 to
the consolidated financial statements.


     We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash expected to be
provided by operating  activities,  available  bank credit  facilities and trade
credit will be sufficient  to fund both our short- and  long-term  capital needs
for the foreseeable future.

Inflation and Seasonality

     We succeeded,  in many cases,  in reducing the effects of merchandise  cost
increases   principally  by  taking  advantage  of  vendor  incentive  programs,
economies of scale  resulting from  increased  volume of purchases and selective
forward  buying.  As a result,  we do not believe that our operations  have been
materially affected by inflation.

     Our business is somewhat  seasonal,  primarily as a result of the impact of
weather  conditions  on store sales.  Store sales and profits have  historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  (April through  September) of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters.

Shareholder Rights Plan

     On May 17, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan.
One Right was  distributed  for each share of common  stock,  par value $.01 per
share, of the Company held by shareholders of record as of the close of business
on May 31,  2002.  Each  right  initially  entitles  shareholders  to buy a unit
representing one  one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock of
the Company for $160 and expires on May 30, 2012.  The rights  generally will be
exercisable  only if a person or group acquires  beneficial  ownership of 15% or
more of the Company's  common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon
consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own 15% or more of
the Company's common stock. If a person or group acquires  beneficial  ownership
of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each right (other than rights held
by the  acquiror)  will,  unless the rights are redeemed by the Company,  become
exercisable  upon payment of the exercise  price of $160 for common stock of the
Company  having a market value of twice the exercise  price of the right. A copy
of the  Stockholder  Rights Plan was filed on May 28, 2002,  with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, as Exhibit 99.1 to our report on Form 8-K.

New Accounting Standards

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. Under the new rules, a liability for the costs
associated  with an exit or  disposal  activity  will  be  recognized  when  the
liability  is incurred as opposed to the date of an  entity's  commitment  to an
exit  plan.  The new  rules  were  effective  for  exit or  disposal  activities
initiated  after December 31, 2002. The adoption of the new rules did not have a
significant  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial  position  or  results  of
operations.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation 45, Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees. The interpretation elaborates on the
disclosures to be made in interim and annual financial statements of a guarantor
about its  obligations  under  certain  guarantees  that it has issued.  It also
clarifies  that a guarantor  is required to  recognize,  at the  inception  of a
guarantee,  a  liability  for the fair  value of the  obligation  undertaken  in
issuing such guarantee.  Initial  recognition and measurement  provisions of the
interpretation  were applicable on a prospective  basis to guarantees  issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were effective for
financial  statements  of interim or annual  periods  ending after  December 15,
2002.  As of  December  31,  2003 and  2002,  we did not  have  any  outstanding
guarantees other than subsidiary  guarantees of parent debt and a residual value
guarantee  as  disclosed  in Notes 5 and 6,  respectively,  to the  consolidated
financial statements.

New Accounting Standards (continued)

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure,  amending SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation.  SFAS No.  148 gives  companies  electing  to expense
employee stock options three methods to do so. In addition, the statement amends
the  disclosure  requirements  to require more  prominent  disclosure  about the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements.
We have elected to continue  using the intrinsic  value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation, therefore, SFAS No. 148 did not have any effect on our
consolidated  financial  position  or results of  operations.  See Note 9 to the
consolidated   financial   statements  for  additional   information   regarding
stock-based compensation.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities.  The interpretation  expands upon and strengthens
existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its
financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. A
variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal
structure  used for  business  purposes  that  either  (a) does not have  equity
investors  with voting  rights or (b) has equity  investors  that do not provide
sufficient  financial  resources for the entity to support its  activities.  The
interpretation  requires  a variable  interest  entity to be  consolidated  by a
company if that  company  is subject to a majority  of the risk of loss from the
variable  interest  entity's  activities or is entitled to receive a majority of
the entity's  residual  returns or both. The  consolidation  requirements of the
interpretation  applied  immediately to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. The  consolidation  requirements  applied to older entities in
the first fiscal year or interim  period  beginning  after December 15, 2003. On
June 26,  2003,  we signed an Amended  and  Restated  Agreement  relating to our
properties leased from SunTrust Equity Funding, LLC. The agreement with SunTrust
Equity Funding, LLC has been recorded and disclosed as an operating lease in the
consolidated  financial  statements in accordance with SFAS No. 13 and Financial
Interpretation 46.

     In March 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on
Issue No.  02-16,  Accounting  by a Customer  (including a Reseller) for Certain
Consideration Received from a Vendor. Under the new guidance, cash consideration
received from a vendor should be classified as a reduction of cost of sales.  If
the  consideration  received  represents  a payment for assets  delivered to the
vendor,  it  should  be  classified  as  revenue.  If  the  consideration  is  a
reimbursement of a specific, incremental,  identifiable cost incurred in selling
the vendor's  product,  the cost should be  characterized as a reduction of that
cost  incurred.  The guidance was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003. The
Company's  policies and  practices  for  recording  such vendor  concessions  as
co-operative  advertising and vendor  allowances and discounts were aligned with
the EITF's guidance both prior to and after the application date, therefore, the
release  did not have any  effect  on our  consolidated  financial  position  or
results of operations.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Business

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc.  (the  Company)  is a  specialty  retailer  and
supplier of automotive  aftermarket  parts,  tools,  supplies and accessories to
both the do-it-yourself (DIY) customer and the professional installer throughout
Alabama, Arkansas,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee,
Texas and Virginia.

Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned  subsidiaries.  All significant  intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

     Over-the-counter   retail  sales  are  recorded  when  the  customer  takes
possession of merchandise. Sales to professional installers, also referred to as
"commercial  sales",  are recorded upon delivery of merchandise to the customer,
generally  at the  customer's  place  of  business.  Wholesale  sales  to  other
retailers,  also  referred to as "jobber  sales" are recorded  upon  shipment of
merchandise. All sales are recorded net of estimated allowances and discounts.

Use of Estimates

     The preparation of the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in conformity
with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States  (GAAP),
requires  management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Inventory

     Inventory,  which  consists of automotive  hard parts,  maintenance  items,
accessories and tools,  is stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost has been
determined  using  the  last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  method.  If  the  first-in,
first-out  (FIFO)  method of  costing  inventory  had been used by the  Company,
inventory would have been $543,924,000 and $499,501,000 as of December 31, 2003,
and 2002,  respectively.  During 2003, the Company entered into various programs
and  arrangements  with certain of its vendors that provide for extended  dating
and payment terms for inventory purchases, including pay-on-scan arrangements.

  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Amounts Receivable from Vendors

     The Company  receives  concessions  from its  vendors  through a variety of
programs  and  arrangements,  including  co-operative  advertising,  devaluation
programs,  allowances for warranties and volume purchase  rebates.  Co-operative
advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific
to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a
reduction  of  advertising  expense  in the  period  in  which  the  advertising
occurred.  All other vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction of cost of
sales when recognized in the consolidated  income statement.  Amounts receivable
from vendors also includes  amounts due the Company for  changeover  merchandise
and product returns.  Reserves for uncollectable amounts receivable from vendors
are  provided  for  in  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  and
consistently have been within management's expectations.

Property and Equipment

     Property and  equipment  are carried at cost.  Depreciation  is provided on
straight-line  and  accelerated  methods over the estimated  useful lives of the
assets.  Service lives for property and equipment  generally range from three to
forty years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful
lives or the term of the respective  underlying  lease.  Maintenance and repairs
are  charged to expense  as  incurred.  Upon  retirement  or sale,  the cost and
accumulated  depreciation  are  eliminated  and the  gain or  loss,  if any,  is
included  in the  determination  of net income as a  component  of other  income
(expense).  The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable.

     The Company  capitalizes  interest costs as a component of  construction in
progress,  based on the  weighted-average  rates paid for long-term  borrowings.
Total interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, were $1,808,000, $369,000 and $1,358,000, respectively.

Income Taxes

     The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using the  liability  method in
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109. The
liability   method  provides  that  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are
determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and  liabilities  and are  measured  using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Advertising Costs

     The Company expenses  advertising  costs as incurred.  Advertising  expense
charged to operations  amounted to $19,533,000,  $14,442,000 and $12,796,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Pre-opening Costs

     Costs associated with the opening of new stores, which consist primarily of
payroll and occupancy costs, are charged to operations as incurred.

Stock Option Plans

     The Company has elected to follow  Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No.
25,   Accounting   for  Stock  Issued  to   Employees   (APB  25),  and  related
interpretations  in  accounting  for its  employee  stock  options  because,  as
discussed in Note 10, the alternative fair value  accounting  provided for under
SFAS No. 123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  requires  the use of
option  valuation  models that were not  developed  for use in valuing  employee
stock  options.  SFAS  No.  148,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based   Compensation  -
Transition  and  Disclosure,   further  established  accounting  and  disclosure
requirements  using a  fair-value-based  method of  accounting  for  stock-based
employee compensation plans. Under the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB 25,  because the exercise  price of the Company's  stock options  equals the
market  price of the  underlying  stock on the date of  grant,  no  compensation
expense is recognized.

     For  purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period.  The Company's
pro forma information for the year ended December 31, is as follows:

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Earnings per Share

     Basic  earnings  per  share is based  on the  weighted-average  outstanding
common  shares.  Diluted  earnings  per  share is based on the  weighted-average
outstanding shares adjusted for the effect of common stock  equivalents.  Common
stock equivalents that could potentially  dilute basic earnings per share in the
future that were not  included in the fully  diluted  computation  because  they
would have been antidilutive were 66,750, 816,250 and 28,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

 Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents  consist of investments with maturities of 90 days or less
at the day of purchase.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     Financial   instruments   that   potentially   subject   the   Company   to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and
accounts and notes receivable.

     The  Company  grants  credit to certain  customers  who meet the  Company's
pre-established credit requirements.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to these trade  receivables  are limited  because the  Company's  customer  base
consist of a large number of smaller customers,  thus spreading the trade credit
risk. The Company controls credit risk through credit  approvals,  credit limits
and monitoring  procedures  and generally  does not require  security when trade
credit is granted to customers.  Credit losses are provided for in the Company's
consolidated financial statements and consistently have been within management's
expectations.

     The carrying value of the Company's financial  instruments,  including cash
and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt,
as reported in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets,  approximates fair
value.

Notes Receivable

     The  Company had notes  receivable  from  vendors  and other third  parties
amounting  to  $27,636,000  and  $2,362,000  at  December  31,  2003  and  2002,
respectively. The notes receivable, which bear interest at rates ranging from 0%
to 6%, are due in varying amounts through August 2017.

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In June,  2002,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated  with Exit or Disposal  Activities.  Under the new rules, a liability
for the costs  associated  with an exit or disposal  activity will be recognized
when the liability is incurred as opposed to the date of an entity's  commitment
to an exit plan.  The new rules are  effective  for exit or disposal  activities
that are initiated  after  December 31, 2002.  The adoption of the new rules did
not have a significant impact on our consolidated  financial position or results
of operations.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure,  amending SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation.  SFAS No.  148 gives  companies  electing  to expense
employee stock options three methods to do so. In addition, the statement amends
the  disclosure  requirements  to require more  prominent  disclosure  about the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements.
The  Company  has  elected  to  continue  using the  intrinsic  value  method of
accounting for stock-based  compensation,  therefore,  SFAS No. 123 did not have
any  effect on the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position  or  results of
operations.  See Note 9 to the consolidated  financial statements for additional
information regarding stock-based compensation.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued Financial  Interpretation 45, Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees.  The  interpretation
elaborates  on the  disclosures  to be  made in  interim  and  annual  financial
statements of a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it
has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize,  at the
inception  of a  guarantee,  a  liability  for the fair value of the  obligation
undertaken  in issuing  such  guarantee.  Initial  recognition  and  measurement
provisions of the  interpretation  were  applicable  on a  prospective  basis to
guarantees   issued  or  modified   after  December  31,  2002.  The  disclosure
requirements  were  effective  for  financial  statements  of  interim or annual
periods  ending after  December 15, 2002. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the
Company did not have any outstanding guarantees other than subsidiary guarantees
of parent debt and a residual  value  guarantee  as  disclosed in Notes 5 and 6,
respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

New Accounting Pronouncements (continued)

     In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities.  The interpretation  expands upon and strengthens
existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its
financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. A
variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal
structure  used for  business  purposes  that  either  (a) does not have  equity
investors  with voting  rights or (b) has equity  investors  that do not provide
sufficient  financial  resources for the entity to support its  activities.  The
interpretation  requires  a variable  interest  entity to be  consolidated  by a
company if that  company  is subject to a majority  of the risk of loss from the
variable  interest  entity's  activities or is entitled to receive a majority of
the entity's  residual  returns or both. The  consolidation  requirements of the
interpretation  applied  immediately to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. The  consolidation  requirements  applied to older entities in
the first fiscal year and interim period  beginning  after December 15, 2003. On
June 26, 2003, the Company signed an Amended and Restated  Agreement relating to
our  properties  leased from  SunTrust  Equity  Funding,  LLC. As a result,  the
agreement  with SunTrust  Equity  Funding,  LLC has been  properly  recorded and
disclosed as an operating lease in the consolidated financial statements.

     In March 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on
Issue No.  02-16,  Accounting  by a Customer  (including a Reseller) for Certain
Consideration Received from a Vendor. Under the new guidance, cash consideration
received from a vendor should be classified as a reduction of cost of sales.  If
the  consideration  received  represents  a payment for assets  delivered to the
vendor,  it  should  be  classified  as  revenue.  If  the  consideration  is  a
reimbursement  of a specific,  incremental  and  identifiable  cost  incurred in
selling the vendor's product, the cost should be characterized as a reduction of
that cost incurred.  The guidance was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003.
The Company's  policies and practices for recording  such vendor  concessions as
co-operative  advertising and vendor  allowances and discounts were aligned with
the EITF's guidance both prior to and after the application date, therefore, the
release  did not have any  effect  on our  consolidated  financial  position  or
results of operations.

NOTE 2-ACQUISITION

     On October 1, 2001, the Company  purchased all of the outstanding  stock of
Mid-State  Automotive  Distributors,  Inc.  (Mid-State) for approximately  $20.5
million including  acquisition  costs.  Mid-State was a specialty retailer which
supplied   automotive   aftermarket  parts  throughout  certain  states  in  the
southeastern part of the United States.  The acquisition was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations of
Mid-State are included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The pro
forma effect on earnings of the acquisition of Mid-State was not material.

NOTE 3-RELATED PARTIES

     The Company leases certain land and buildings  related to its O'Reilly Auto
Parts stores under six-year operating lease agreements with O'Reilly  Investment
Company  and  O'Reilly  Real  Estate  Company,  partnerships  in  which  certain
shareholders and directors of the Company are partners.  Generally,  these lease
agreements provide for renewal options for an additional six years at the option
of the Company.  Additionally,  the Company  leases  certain land and  buildings
related to O'Reilly Auto Parts stores under 15-year  operating lease  agreements
with  O'Reilly-Wooten  2000 LLC, which is owned by certain  shareholders  of the
Company.  Generally,  these lease agreements provide for renewal options for two
additional  five-year  terms at the  option of the  Company  (see Note 6).  Rent
expense  under  these  operating  leases  totaled  $3,238,000,   $3,222,000  and
$2,894,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

NOTE 4-NOTE PAYABLE TO BANK

     At December 31, 2001, the Company had available  short-term  unsecured bank
lines of credit providing for maximum borrowings of $5 million, all of which was
outstanding at December 31, 2001. The lines of credit were fully repaid in 2002.

NOTE 5-LONG-TERM DEBT

     On July 29, 2002, the Company completed an unsecured, three-year syndicated
credit  facility  (Credit  Facility)  in the amount of $150 million led by Wells
Fargo Bank as the Administrative Agent,  replacing a five-year syndicated credit
facility.  The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of our  subsidiaries and may
be  increased  to a total  of $200  million,  subject  to  availability  of such
additional credit from either existing banks within the Credit Facility or other
banks.  The Credit  Facility  bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from
0.875% to 1.375% (2.06% at December 31, 2003 and 2.26% at December 31, 2002) and
expires in July 2005.  At December  31, 2003 and 2002,  $20.0  million and $90.0
million,  respectively,  of the Credit Facility was  outstanding.  Additionally,
letters of credit  totaling  $11.0 million and $6.0 million were  outstanding at
December  31,  2003  and  2002,   respectively.   Accordingly,   our   aggregate
availability  for  additional  borrowings  under the Credit  Facility was $119.0
million and $54.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Prior to
July 29, 2002, the Company had available an unsecured credit facility  providing
for maximum  borrowings of $140 million.  The former facility was comprised of a
revolving credit facility of $125 million,  and a term loan of $15 million.  The
former  facility,  which bore  interest at LIBOR plus 0.50%,  expired in January
2003. All borrowings outstanding under the old credit facility were fully repaid
in July 2002.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 5-LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)

     The Company  issues  stand-by  letters of credit  provided by a $20 million
sublimit  under the Credit  Facility  that reduce  available  borrowings.  These
letters of credit are issued  primarily to satisfy the  requirements  of workers
compensation,  general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all
of the  outstanding  letters  of credit  have a  one-year  term from the date of
issuance  and have been  issued to replace  surety  bonds  that were  previously
issued.  Letters  of  credit  totaling  $11.0  million  and  $6.0  million  were
outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     On May 16, 2001, the Company  completed a $100 million private placement of
two series of unsecured  senior notes (Senior  Notes).  The Series 2001-A Senior
Notes were issued for $75 million,  are due May 16, 2006,  and bear  interest at
7.72% per year. The Series 2001-B Senior Notes were issued for $25 million,  are
due May 16, 2008,  and bear  interest at 7.92% per year.  The private  placement
agreement allows for a total of $200 million of Senior Notes issuable in series.
Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce  outstanding  borrowings under
the Company's former revolving credit facility.

     The Company leases certain computer equipment under capitalized leases. The
lease  agreements have terms ranging from 30 months to 36 months,  expiring from
2004 to 2006.  At  December  31,  2003,  the  monthly  installments  under these
agreements were approximately  $85,000.  The present value of the future minimum
lease payments under these agreements  totaled $882,000 and $549,000 at December
31, 2003, and 2002, respectively, which has been classified as long-term debt in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  During 2003, 2002 and 2001,
the Company purchased $1,426,000, $812,000 and $467,000, respectively, of assets
under capitalized leases.

     Additionally,   the  Company  has  various   unsecured   notes  payable  to
individuals and banks,  amounting to $81,000 and $172,000, at December 31, 2003,
and 2002,  respectively.  The  weighted-average  interest rate on these notes is
7.2% with monthly installments of approximately $2,000 including interest.

     Principal  maturities  of  long-term  debt for each of the next five  years
ending December 31, are as follows (amounts in thousands):



     Cash paid by the Company for interest  during the years ended  December 31,
2003,  2002,  and 2001,  amounted to  $6,864,000,  $9,248,000,  and  $9,092,000,
respectively.

NOTE 6-COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

     On June 26, 2003, we completed an amended and restated master  agreement to
our  $50  million  Synthetic  Operating  Lease  Facility  (the  Facility  or the
Synthetic  Lease)  with a group  of  financial  institutions.  The  terms of the
Facility  provide for an initial  lease period of five years,  a residual  value
guarantee of  approximately  $44.2  million at December  31, 2003,  and purchase
options on the  properties.  The Facility also contains a provision for an event
of default  whereby the lessor,  among other things,  may require us to purchase
any or all of the properties. One additional renewal period of five years may be
requested  from the lessor,  although the lessor is not  obligated to grant such
renewal.  The  amended  and  restated  Facility  has  been  accounted  for as an
operating  lease  under  SFAS  No.  13 and  related  interpretations,  including
Financial  Interpretation  No. 46. Future minimum rental  commitments  under the
Facility  have  been  included  in the  table of future  minimum  annual  rental
commitments below.

     On December 29, 2000, the Company  completed a sale-leaseback  transaction.
Under the terms of the  transaction,  the Company sold 90 properties,  including
land,  buildings and  improvements,  which generated $52.3 million of additional
cash. The lease,  which is being accounted for as an operating  lease,  provides
for an  initial  lease  term of 21 years  and may be  extended  for one  initial
ten-year  period and two additional  successive  periods of five years each. The
resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the
initial lease term. Net rent expense is approximately  $5.5 million annually and
is included in the table of future minimum annual rental commitments below.

     In August 2001, the Company completed a sale-leaseback with O'Reilly-Wooten
2000  LLC  (an  entity  owned  by  certain  shareholders  of the  Company).  The
transaction  involved the sale and  leaseback of nine O'Reilly Auto Parts stores
and resulted in  approximately  $5.6 million of additional  cash to the Company.
The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease,  which has
been accounted for as an operating lease,  calls for an initial term of 15 years
with three five-year renewal options.

NOTE 6-COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

     The Company also leases certain office space,  retail stores,  property and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases. Most of these leases
include  renewal options and some include options to purchase and provisions for
percentage  rent based on sales.  At December 31, 2003,  future  minimum  rental
payments under all of the Company's  operating  leases for each of the next five
years and in the aggregate are as follows (amounts in thousands):



     Rental expense amounted to $31,865,000, $29,652,000 and $25,122,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Other Commitments

     The Company had construction commitments, which totaled approximately $52.8
million, at December 31, 2003.

NOTE 7-LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is  involved in various  legal  proceedings  incidental  to the
conduct of its  business.  Although the Company  cannot  ascertain the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters,  it does not  currently
believe that, in the aggregate,  they will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated  financial  position,  results of  operations  or cash flows of the
Company.

NOTE 8-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company  sponsors a  contributory  profit sharing and savings plan that
covers  substantially  all  employees  who are 21 years of age with at least six
months of service. A total of 1,600,000 shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance  under the plan.  Employees  may  contribute up to 100% of their annual
compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum  limitations.  The Company
has agreed to make matching  contributions  equal to 50% of the first 2% of each
employee's contribution and 25% of the next 4% of each employee's  contribution.
Additional  contributions to the plan may be made as determined  annually by the
Board of  Directors.  After  two years of  service,  Company  contributions  and
earnings thereon vest at the rate of 20% per year. Company contributions charged
to operations amounted to $4,353,000 in 2003,  $3,438,000 in 2002 and $3,207,000
in 2001.  Company  contributions,  in the form of common  stock,  to the  profit
sharing and savings plan to match employee  contributions during the years ended
December 31 were as follows:



     Profit sharing contributions accrued at December 31, and funded in the next
year  through  the  issuance  of shares of the  Company's  common  stock were as
follows:


     The Company also  sponsors a non-funded  non-contributory  defined  benefit
health care plan,  which provides  certain health benefits to qualified  retired
employees.  According to the terms of this plan,  retirees'  annual benefits are
limited to $1,000 per employee  starting at age 66 for employees with 20 or more
years of  service.  Post-retirement  benefit  costs for each of the years  ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 amounted to $12,000.

NOTE 8-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)

     Additionally,  the Company has  adopted a stock  purchase  plan under which
1,300,000  shares of common stock were  reserved for  issuance.  Under the plan,
substantially  all  employees  and  non-employee  directors  have  the  right to
purchase shares of the Company's common stock monthly at a price equal to 85% of
the fair market value of the stock, not to exceed 5% of the participants  annual
salary. Purchases of common stock under the plan during the years ended December
31 were as follows:



     The Company has in effect a  performance  incentive  plan for the Company's
senior  management  under  which  400,000  shares  of stock  were  reserved  for
issuance.  Shares  awarded under the plan vest equally over a three-year  period
and are held in escrow until such  vesting has  occurred.  Shares are  forfeited
when an employee ceases employment. Shares, net of forfeitures, issued under the
plan during the years ended December 31 were as follows:

NOTE 9-SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shareholder Rights Plan

     On May 17, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan.
One Right was  distributed  for each share of common  stock,  par value $.01 per
share, of the Company held by stockholders of record as of the close of business
on May  31,  2002.  The  Rights  initially  entitle  stockholders  to buy a unit
representing one  one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock of
the Company for $160 and expire on May 30, 2012.  The Rights  generally  will be
exercisable  only if a person or group acquires  beneficial  ownership of 15% or
more of the Company's  common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon
consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own 15% or more of
the Company's common stock. If a person or group acquires  beneficial  ownership
of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each Right (other than Rights held
by the  acquiror)  will,  unless the Rights are redeemed by the Company,  become
exercisable  upon payment of the exercise  price of $160 for common stock of the
Company  having a market value of twice the exercise  price of the Right. A copy
of the  Stockholder  Rights Plan was filed on May 28, 2002,  with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, as Exhibit 99.1 to our report on Form 8-K.

Stock Option Plans

     The Company has a stock option plan under which  incentive stock options or
non-qualified  stock  options may be granted to officers and key  employees.  An
aggregate of 12,000,000  shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under
this plan. The exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair
market  value of the stock on the date of grant and the  options  will expire no
later than 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted pursuant to the plan
become  exercisable no sooner than six months from the date of grant. All grants
under the plan since its inception have been non-qualified  stock option grants.
A summary of outstanding stock options under this plan is as follows:



     Options to purchase  1,223,409,  1,566,104 and  1,250,261  shares of common
stock were exercisable at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 9-SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)

     The Company also maintains a stock option plan for  non-employee  directors
of the Company  under which  500,000  shares of common  stock were  reserved for
issuance.  All  director  stock  options are granted at fair market value on the
date of grant and expire on the earlier of termination of service to the Company
as a director or seven years. Options granted under this plan become exercisable
six months from the date of grant. A summary of outstanding  stock options under
this plan is as follows:

     All options under this plan were  exercisable  at December 31, 2003,  2002,
and 2001.

     Pro forma  information  regarding  net  income  and  earnings  per share is
required  by SFAS  No.  123,  and has  been  determined  as if the  Company  had
accounted  for its employee and  non-employee  director  stock options under the
fair value method.

     The fair values for these options were estimated at the date of grant using
a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with  the  following  weighted-average
assumptions for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively:  risk-free interest rates of
3.61%,  4.01% and 5.16%;  volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Company's  common stock of .458, .481, and .475; and  weighted-average  expected
life of the options of 9.4, 9.0 and 9.0 years. The Company assumed a 0% dividend
yield over the expected life of the options. The weighted-average fair values of
options  granted during the years ended  December 31, 2003,  2002, and 2001 were
$20.56,  $17.75  and  $16.52,   respectively.   The  weighted-average  remaining
contractual  life at December 31, 2003,  for all  outstanding  options under the
Company's stock option plans is 7.5 years. The  weighted-average  exercise price
for all  outstanding  options under the Company's stock option plans was $26.11,
$22.78 and $20.63 at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     The  Black-Scholes   option  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded options,  which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.   Because  the   Company's   stock   options  have   characteristics
significantly  different from those of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's opinion, the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

                         Report Of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2003,  and 2002, and the
related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the  three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2003.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  at December 31,  2003,  and 2002,  and the
consolidated  results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
