and its subsidiaries.


                                     PART I
Item 1.  Business

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. is one of the largest  specialty  retailers  of
automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the
United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ("DIY") customers and
professional  installers.  At  December  31,  2001,  we  operated  875 stores in
Alabama, Arkansas,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Missouri,  Mississippi,  Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Our
stores carry an extensive product line consisting of:

o new and remanufactured  automotive hard parts, such as alternators,  starters,
  fuel pumps, water pumps, brake shoes and pads, chassis parts and engine parts;
o maintenance  items,  such as oil,  antifreeze,  fluids,  engine  additives and
  appearance products;
o accessories, such as floor mats and seat covers; and
o a complete line of autobody paint and related materials,  automotive tools and
  professional service equipment.

We do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations.


     We were  founded  in 1957 by Charles F.  O'Reilly  and his son,  Charles H.
''Chub'' O'Reilly,  Sr. (one of our current  directors),  and initially operated
from a single store in  Springfield,  Missouri.  The O'Reilly family has managed
the Company since our inception.

     Our goal is to continue  to achieve  growth in sales and  profitability  by
capitalizing  on  our  competitive  advantages  and  executing  our  growth  and
expansion strategies.

     See "Risk Factors"  beginning on page 11 for a description of certain risks
relevant to our  business.  These risk  factors  include,  among  others,  risks
related  to  competition  in the  automotive  aftermarket  business,  our growth
strategy,  our acquisition  strategy,  our sensitivity to regional  economic and
weather  conditions,  our  dependence  upon  key  and  other  personnel  and the
significant voting control held by our principal shareholders.

Competitive Advantages

     Proven  Ability to Execute  Dual Market  Strategy.  We have an  established
track record of serving both  do-it-yourself  ("DIY") customers and professional
installers.  We  believe  our  ability to execute a dual  market  strategy  is a
competitive advantage, which enables us to:

o target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts;
o capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure;
o profitably operate both in large markets and less densely populated geographic
  areas which typically attract fewer competitors; and
o enhance  service  levels  offered  to our DIY  customers  by  offering a broad
  selection of stock keeping units  (''SKUs'')  and  extensive product knowledge
  required by professional installers.


     We have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years.  For
2001, we derived  approximately  56% of our product sales from our DIY customers
and approximately 44% from our professional installer customers.  As a result of
our  historical  success in executing our dual market  strategy and our over 125
full-time sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer,   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market.

     Superior  Customer  Service.  We seek to attract  new DIY and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service, the key elements of which include:

o superior  in-store service through  highly-motivated,  technically  proficient
  store personnel (''Professional Parts  People'') using advanced  point-of-sale
  systems;
o an extensive selection of products;
o attractive stores in convenient locations; and
o competitive pricing, with a low price guarantee.

     Technically  Proficient  Professional  Parts People.  Our highly proficient
Professional Parts People provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage,
particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional
Parts People to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve
the  technically-oriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis.  Such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our DIY customers,  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our Professional Parts People.

     Strategic   Distribution   Systems.   We   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store  network  in  sixteen  contiguous  states  (Alabama,
Arkansas,   Florida,  Georgia,   Illinois,   Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,
Louisiana, Missouri,  Mississippi,  Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas) and
the strategic  locations of our nine distribution  centers enable us to maintain
optimum  inventory  levels  throughout  our  store  network.  In  addition,  our
inventory  management and distribution  systems  electronically link each of our
stores to a distribution  center,  providing for efficient inventory control and
management. Our distribution system provides each of our stores with same day or
overnight access to  approximately  113,000 SKUs, many of which are hard to find
items  not  typically   stocked  by  other  parts  retailers.   We  believe  the
availability  of a broad  range of products is a key  competitive  advantage  in
satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.

     Experienced Management Team. Our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan,  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic  acquisitions.  We have  experienced  nine  consecutive
years of record revenues and earnings growth. We have a strong senior management
team  comprised  of 48  professionals  who average 18 years of  experience  with
O'Reilly.  In  addition,  our 82  district  managers  average  over 9  years  of
experience with us.





Growth and Expansion Strategies

     Aggressively  Open New Stores.  We intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new, contiguous markets. We plan to open approximately 100 stores in
2002 and  approximately  120  stores in 2003.  A  majority  of the sites for our
proposed  2002 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2003
store openings have been identified.  In selecting sites for new stores, we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management,  advertising  and
distribution.

     Until 1986, our expansion was targeted to markets with  populations of less
than  100,000.  We entered into a more densely  populated  market in August 1986
with the opening of the first of 29 stores in the greater Kansas City, Missouri,
market area. Of the 203 net new stores added in 2001, 16 are located in Alabama,
33 in Arkansas,  4 in Florida, 5 in Georgia,  2 in Illinois,  5 in Indiana, 8 in
Iowa, 2 in Kansas,  7 in  Kentucky,  10 in  Louisiana,  6 in  Mississippi,  7 in
Missouri, 2 in Nebraska, 4 in Oklahoma, 41 in Tennessee,  and 51 in Texas. 82 of
the 203 net new stores  added in 2002  related to our  acquisition  of Mid-State
Automotive  ("Mid-State").  While we have faced, and expect to continue to face,
more aggressive  competition in the more densely populated  markets,  we believe
that we have competed  effectively,  and that we are well positioned to continue
to compete effectively,  in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales
and profit growth within these markets. We also believe that because of our dual
market strategy,  we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated
areas within our regional market which would not otherwise support a national or
regional  chain  store  selling  to one  portion  of the  market  or the  other.
Consequently, we expect to continue to open new stores in less densely populated
market areas.

     To date,  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to O'Reilly stores. We typically open new
stores  either (i) by  constructing  a new store at a site which is purchased or
leased  and  stocking  the new store with  fixtures  and  inventory,  or (ii) by
acquiring  an  independently  owned parts  store,  typically  by the purchase of
substantially  all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such
store.  Store  sites are  strategically  located in clusters  within  geographic
areas, which complement our distribution system in order to achieve economies of
scale in management,  advertising,  and distribution costs. Other key factors we
consider in the site selection  process  include  population  density and growth
patterns, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, the number and type
of  existing  automotive  repair  facilities,   auto  parts  stores,  and  other
competitors within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such
competitors.  When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale.

     Same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy.   To  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business,   it  is  customer  satisfaction  (whether  of  the  DIY  consumer  or
professional installer), resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability.

     Selectively   Pursue  Strategic   Acquisitions.   Although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented,  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains, such as O'Reilly, to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation.  Thus,  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer.


     Continually Enhance Store Design and Location.  Our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage,  higher ceilings,
more convenient  interior store layouts,  brighter  lighting,  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers,  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service.  We continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design.  We  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network,  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers.

Products and Purchasing

     Our stores offer DIY and professional  installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles,
vans  and  trucks.  We do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations.  Our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized,
well-advertised,  name brand products such as AC Delco,  Moog,  Murray,  Wagner,
Gates Rubber, Federal Mogul, Monroe, Prestone, Quaker State, Pennzoil,  Castrol,
Valvoline, STP, BWD, Cardone, Wix, Armor All and Turtle Wax. In addition to name
brand products,  our stores carry a wide variety of  high-quality  private label
products  under  the  Parts  Master  name  brand and our  O'Reilly  Auto  Parts,
SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Ultima and Omnispark  proprietary name brands.  Because
most of our  private  label  products  are  produced  by  nationally  recognized
manufacturers in accordance with our specifications, we believe that the private
label  products are  generally of equal or, in some cases,  better  quality than
comparable  name brand  products,  a  characteristic  which is  important to our
professional  installer  clientele.  We further  believe that the private  label
products  are  packaged  attractively  to  promote  customer  interest  and  are
generally priced below comparable name brand products carried in our stores.

     We purchase  automotive  products from approximately 400 vendors,  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 25% of our total purchases in 2001.
Our largest vendor in 2001 accounted for approximately 7% of our total purchases
and the next four largest vendors  accounted for 4-5% of such purchases each. We
have no long-term  contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors, nor
have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory  alternative sources of
supply for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources exist at
substantially  similar costs, for substantially all automotive  products that we
sell.  It is our  policy  to  take  advantage  of  early  payment  and  seasonal
purchasing  discounts  offered by our vendors,  and to utilize  extended  dating
terms  available  from  vendors  due  to  volume  purchasing.  We  consider  our
relationships with our suppliers to be good.

Store Network

     Store Locations.  As a result of our dual market  strategy,  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large,  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas which would not otherwise  support a national or regional chain
selling to just one portion of the automotive  aftermarket.  The following table
sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores:






     Our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   22,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately  6,700 total square feet in size.  At December 31, 2001,  we had a
total of  approximately  5.88 million square feet in our 875 stores.  Our stores
are served primarily by the nearest distribution center, but also have access to
the broader  selection of inventory  available at one of our 38 Master Inventory
Stores,   which  on  average  carry   approximately   38,000  SKUs  and  average
approximately 9,400 square feet in size. Master Inventory Stores, in addition to
serving DIY and professional  installer customers in their markets, also provide
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of SKUs on a
same day basis.

     We believe that our stores are ''destination  stores'' generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity.  Consequently,  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares,  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access.

     Store  Layout.  We  utilize a  computer-assisted  ''plan-o-grammed''  store
layout  system to provide a uniform  and  consistent  merchandise  presentation;
however,  some  variation  occurs  in  order  to meet  the  specific  needs of a
particular market area.  Merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access
and maximum selling space, keeping high-turnover products and accessories within
view of the customer.  Aisle displays are generally used to feature  high-demand
or seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.

     Store  Automation.  To enhance store level operations and customer service,
we use IBM AS/400  computer  systems in all of our  stores.  These  systems  are
linked  with  the IBM  AS/400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers. Our point-of-sale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make,  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise.  This
system speeds  transaction  times,  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service.   Moreover,   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management,  strategic  planning,  inventory
control and distribution efficiency.

     New Store Site  Selection.  In selecting  sites for new stores,  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management,  advertising and  distribution.  Other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include:



o population density and growth patterns;
o age and per capita income;
o vehicle traffic counts;
o the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities; and
o the number of auto parts stores and other competitors  within a pre-determined
  radius and the operational strength of such competitors.

     When entering new, more densely  populated  markets,  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale.  After  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores,  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas. This strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market.

Distribution System

The following table sets forth the distribution centers we currently operate:



     The Nashville,  Tennessee, and Knoxville,  Tennessee,  distribution centers
were added in October 2001,  which related to our  acquisition of Mid-State.  In
addition, adjacent to the Springfield, Missouri, distribution center, we operate
a 36,000 square foot bulk  merchandise  warehouse used for the  distribution  of
bulk products such as motor oil,  antifreeze,  batteries,  lubricants  and other
fast moving bulk products,  and an 18,000 square foot returned goods  processing
facility.  The  Nashville,  Tennessee,  distribution  center  has a 97,000  bulk
facility  that is operated for the  distribution  of paint,  body and  equipment
supplies. We also operate a 22,500 square foot bulk warehouse in McAllen, Texas,
that serves the surrounding distribution centers with bulk motor oil.

     Our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems,  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis.  The  distribution  centers
utilize  computer-assisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores.  In  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores, we have established a  satellite-based  data interchange
system among those stores in which  high-speed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available,  the distribution  center, which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters.

     We  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventory-carrying   costs,   improving  our  store  in-stock   positions,   and
controlling and managing our inventory.  Moreover, we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores,  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas.
Our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center.  As part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network, in 2002 we plan to:


o initiate full utilization of the Nashville and Knoxville  distribution centers
  to be served by all stores in those surrounding areas
o implement improvement plans to increase inventory turnover in all distribution
  centers; and
o upgrade  merchandise  handling  equipment  in  several  distribution  centers
  including conveyor systems, forklifts and racking.

Marketing

     Marketing  to the  DIY  Customer.  We  aggressively  promote  sales  to DIY
customers through an extensive  advertising program,  which includes direct mail
and newspaper,  radio and television advertising in selected markets. We believe
that our  advertising  and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant
name recognition in each of our market areas. Newspaper and radio advertisements
are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions, frequently
in connection with specific sale events and promotions.  To promote sales to car
enthusiasts,  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally, we sponsor 12 nationally televised races and
over 85  motorsports  races  and car shows at over 125  racetracks  in 9 states,
including  the  O'Reilly  Chili Bowl,  the World of Outlaws  Series,  the NASCAR
Craftsmen Truck Series, as well as four National Hotrod Racing Association races
in Houston and Dallas.  For the next year, we will also sponsor the NASCAR Busch
Series  Races and Winston  Cup  Qualifying,  in  addition  to 2 more  nationally
televised  races.  We have found that the more  progressive  marketing  concepts
utilized  in the DIY  portion of our  business  can also be applied to  increase
sales to our professional installer customers.

     Marketing  to the  Professional  Installer.  We  have  over  125  full-time
O'Reilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve,  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer. Our First Call program, which is
our commitment to the professional  customer,  includes a dedicated sales force,
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer.
Moreover,  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis. Our First Call marketing  strategy,  with respect to professional
installers, emphasizes our ability to offer:

o prompt delivery using small trucks or vans operated by most of our stores;
o a  separate  counter in most of our stores  dedicated  exclusively  to serving
  professional installers;
o trade credit for qualified professional installers;
o broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing;
o a  professional  installer  computer  system  that  connects  directly  to our
  inventory system; and
o seminars  concerning  topics of interest to professional  installers,  such as
  technical updates, safety and general business management.

     Marketing to the Independently  Owned Parts Store. Along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
O'Reilly  stores,  Ozark  Automotive  Distributors,  Inc.  ("Ozark")  also sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an O'Reilly  store.  We generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products,   but  have,  on  occasion,   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by Ozark.  Ozark  operates  its own
separate  marketing program to independently  owned parts stores through a staff
of 14.


     Of  the  approximately  362  independently  owned  parts  stores  currently
purchasing  automotive  products from Ozark,  253 participate in the Auto Value
program through Ozark. As a participant in this program,  an independently owned
parts store which meets certain minimum  financial and operational  standards is
permitted to indicate its Auto Value membership through the display of the Auto
Value logo, which is owned by The Alliance,  Inc. (formerly known as Auto Value
Associates,  Inc.), a non-profit buying group consisting of approximately  3,515
members as of December 31, 2001, including O'Reilly, engaged in the distribution
or sale  of  automotive  products.  Additionally,  we  provide  advertising  and
promotional assistance to Auto Value stores purchasing automotive products from
Ozark,  as well as marketing  and sales  support.  In return for a commitment to
purchase  automotive  products from Ozark, we offer assistance to an Auto Value
independently  owned parts store by  providing  loan  guarantees  and  financing
secured by inventory, furniture and fixtures, making available computer software
for  inventory  control  and  performing   certain  accounting  and  bookkeeping
functions.

Management Structure

     Each of our  stores  is  staffed  with a  store  manager  and an  assistant
manager, in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet
the specific needs of each store.  Each of our 82 district  managers has general
supervisory  responsibility  for an average of 11 stores  within such  manager's
district.

     Each  district  manager  receives  comprehensive  training on a  bi-monthly
basis, focusing on management techniques,  new product  announcements,  advanced
automotive  systems and our policies and  procedures.  In turn, the  information
covered at such bi-monthly meetings is discussed in full by district managers at
bi-monthly  meetings  with their store  managers.  All  assistant  managers  and
manager  trainees  are  required to  successfully  complete a six-month  manager
training program, which includes classroom and field training, as a prerequisite
to becoming a store manager. This program covers operations extensively, as well
as principles of successful management.  Shortly after becoming a store manager,
all managers  attend a manager  development  program,  at the  corporate  office
headquarters,  which includes 72 hours of classroom training.  Upon returning to
the stores,  managers  are given  continuous  field  training  throughout  their
management experience.

     We provide financial  incentives to our district managers,  store managers,
assistant  managers  and sales  specialists  through an  incentive  compensation
program.  Under our incentive  compensation program, base salary is augmented by
incentive  compensation  based upon the  achievement of sales and  profitability
goals.  We  believe  that  our  incentive   compensation  program  significantly
increases the  motivation  and overall  performance  of our  Professional  Parts
People and our  ability to attract  and retain  qualified  management  and other
personnel.

     Most of our current senior management, district managers and store managers
were promoted to their positions from within the Company.  Our senior management
team averages 18 years of experience with the Company and district managers have
an average length of service with the Company of over 9 years.


Professional Parts People

     We  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  Professional  Parts  People  is
essential in providing  superior service both to DIY and professional  installer
customers.  Each of our Professional  Parts People is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer.
In addition,  we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons,  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts.
We believe  that the ability of our  Professional  Parts  People to provide such
assistance  to  the  DIY  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customer's visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
DIY business.


     We  screen  prospective  employees,  whom we refer to as team  members,  to
identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts
or repairs, or an aptitude for automotive  knowledge.  Each person who becomes a
team member first  participates  in an  intensive  two-day  orientation  program
designed to  introduce  the team member to our culture and his or her job duties
before being assigned specific job  responsibilities.  The successful completion
of additional training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a
parts  specialist  and  thus  able to work at the  parts  counter  of one of our
stores. All new counter people are required to successfully complete a six-month
basic  automotive  systems  training course and are then enrolled in a six-month
advanced  automotive  systems course for certification by the National Institute
for Automotive Service Excellence  (''ASE''),  which administers  national exams
for various  automotive  specialties  and requires ASE certified  specialists to
take recertification exams every five years.

     Each of our stores  participates in our sales specialist  training program.
Under this program,  selected team members  complete two days of extensive sales
call  training  for  business  development,  after which these team members will
spend  one day per week  calling  on  existing  and new  professional  installer
customers.  Additionally, each team member engaged in such sales activities will
participate  in  quarterly  advanced  training  programs  for sales and business
development.


Customer Service

     We seek to provide our customers  with an efficient  and pleasant  in-store
experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products.  We believe that the  satisfaction of DIY and
professional installer customers is substantially  dependent upon our ability to
provide,  in a  timely  fashion,  the  specific  automotive  product  requested.
Accordingly,  each  O'Reilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications.   We
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores,  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.


Pricing

     We believe that a competitive  pricing  policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully.  Product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store.  Most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices,  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing.  Consistent
with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any in-stock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors.

Competition

     We  compete  in both the DIY and  professional  installer  portions  of the
automotive aftermarket. We compete primarily with:

o national and regional retail automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone,  Inc.,
  Advance Auto Parts, CSK Auto Corp. and The Pep Boys-Manny, Moe and Jack,Inc.);
o independently owned parts stores;
o wholesalers  or jobber  stores (some of which are  associated  with  national
  automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA and CarQuest);
o automobile dealers; and
o mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts,  maintenance items
  and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).


     We compete on the basis of customer  service,  which  includes  merchandise
selection and  availability,  price,  helpfulness  of store  personnel and store
layout and location.

Team Members

     As of December 31,  2001,  we had 10,539  full-time  team members and 2,137
part-time  team members,  of whom 9,455 were employed at our stores,  2,356 were
employed at our distribution  centers and 865 were employed at our corporate and
administrative  headquarters.  Our team  members are not subject to a collective
bargaining  agreement.  We consider  our  relations  with our team members to be
excellent,  and strive to promote good relations  with our team members  through
various programs designed for such purposes.

Servicemarks and Trademarks

     We have  registered the  servicemarks  O'Reilly  Automotive,  O'Reilly Auto
Parts,  and Parts Payoff and the trademarks  SuperStart,  BrakeBest,  Omnispark,
First  Call,  Ultima,  and  Master  Pro.  Further,  we are  licensed  to use the
registered  trademarks and servicemarks Auto Value and Parts Master owned by The
Alliance  (formerly  Auto Value  Associates)  in  connection  with our marketing
program.  We believe  that our  business  is not  otherwise  dependent  upon any
patent, trademark, servicemark or copyright.

Regulations

     Although subject to various laws and governmental  regulations  relating to
our business, including those related to the environment, we do not believe that
compliance with such laws and  regulations has a material  adverse effect on our
operations.  Further, we are unaware of any failure to comply with any such laws
and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We
can not give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses
in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation.

Risk Factors

     Some of the  information  in this Form 10-K contains and future reports and
press  releases  and  other  public  information  may  contain   forward-looking
statements that involve  substantial risks and  uncertainties.  You can identify
these statements by forward-looking words such as ''may,'' ''will,'' ''expect,''
''anticipate,''  ''believe,''  ''estimate,''  and ''continue'' or similar words.
These  "forward-looking  statements"  are made in reliance  upon the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (See Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.) You should read statements that contain these words carefully  because
they: (1) discuss our future expectations; (2) contain projections of our future
results  of  operations  or of  our  financial  condition;  or (3)  state  other
''forward-looking''  information.  We believe it is important to communicate our
expectations to our investors.  However,  there may be events in the future that
we are not able to accurately predict or over which we have no control. The risk
factors listed in this section,  as well as any cautionary language in this Form
10-K, are subject to risks,  uncertainties and assumptions,  including,  but not
limited to, competition,  product demand, the market for auto parts, the economy
in general, inflation, consumer debt levels, governmental approvals, our ability
to hire and retain qualified employees,  weather,  terrorist activities, war and
the threat of war. Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results
described  in these  forward-looking  statements.  You  should be aware that the
occurrence  of the events  described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this
Form 10-K  could  have a  material  adverse  effect on our  business,  operating
results and financial condition.

The Automotive Aftermarket Business is Highly Competitive

     Both the DIY and professional installer portions of our business are highly
competitive,  particularly  in the more densely  populated  areas that we serve.
Some of our  competitors  are  larger  than we are and  have  greater  financial
resources.  In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. For a list of our
principal  competitors,  see the ''Competition''  section of Item 1 of this Form
10-K.

We Cannot Assure Future Growth

     We believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future.  Failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock.  Our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather
conditions,  zoning and other issues related to new store site development,  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions.  We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2002 and beyond will be
achieved.  For a  discussion  of our growth  strategies,  see the  ''Growth  and
Expansion Strategies'' section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

Acquisitions May Not Lead to Expected Growth

     We expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy.  Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations. For example: (1) we may not be able to continue
to identify suitable  acquisition  candidates or to acquire additional companies
at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; (2) our management's  attention
may be distracted;  (3) we may fail to retain key acquired personnel; (4) we may
assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; and (5) we may not be
able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions,
for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other
benefits.

Sensitivity to Regional Economic and Weather Conditions

     All of our stores are located in the Central and Southern United States. In
particular, approximately 37% of our stores are located in Texas. Therefore, our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions.
Unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales, particularly to DIY
customers.

Dependence Upon Key and Other Personnel

     Our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel,  including  David E.  O'Reilly,  Lawrence  P.  O'Reilly,  Charles  H.
O'Reilly,  Jr., Rosalie O'Reilly Wooten, Ted F. Wise and Greg L. Henslee. Two of
our key personnel,  Charles H. O'Reilly,  Jr. and Rosalie  O'Reilly  Wooten have
retired from their  operational  duties,  but both will continue to serve on the
Board of Directors.  Our business and results of operations  could be materially
adversely  affected  by the  loss  of the  services  of one  or  more  of  these
individuals.  Additionally,  our successful implementation and management of our
growth and  expansion  strategies  will  depend on our  ability to  continue  to
attract and retain qualified  personnel.  We cannot be sure that we will be able
to  continue  to  attract  such  personnel.  For a  further  discussion  of  our
management and personnel,  see the ''Business'' section of Item 1 and Item 4a of
this Form 10-K and our  Proxy  Statement  on  Schedule  14A for the 2002  Annual
Meeting of Shareholders, a portion of which is incorporated herein.

Significant Voting Control is held by the O'Reilly Family

     As of the date of this  Form 10-K the  O'Reilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  14.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result,
the  O'Reilly  family  acting  together  will  continue  to be able to  exercise
significant  voting  control  over the  Company,  including  the election of our
directors and on any other matter being voted on by our shareholders,  including
any merger, sale of assets or other change in control.


Possible Volatility of Our Stock Price

     The stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions.  The
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts' expectations.  Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock.  In addition,
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies.  In the past, following periods of volatility in
the market price of a company's  securities,  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company.  If similar  litigation were
instituted  against us, it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our management's attention and resources,  which could have an adverse effect on
our business.

Shares Eligible for Future Sale

     All of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended,  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule. We cannot predict the effect,  if any, that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time.  Sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock,  or the perception  that such sales might occur,  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.

Item 2.  Properties

     The   following   table   provides   certain   information   regarding  our
administrative  offices and distribution  centers and offices as of December 31,
2001:



     Of the 875 stores that we operated at December  31,  2001,  262 stores were
owned,  544 stores  were  leased  from  unaffiliated  parties and 69 stores were
leased  from  one of two  real  estate  investment  partnerships  and a  limited
liability  corporation  formed by the O'Reilly family.  Leases with unaffiliated
parties generally  provide for payment of a fixed base rent,  payment of certain
tax,  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses,  and an original  term of 10 years,
subject to one or more  renewals at our option.  The original  terms of 8 stores
leased  from  unaffiliated  parties  expired  prior to the end of 2001 that were
subsequently renewed. We have entered into separate master lease agreements with
each of the affiliated real estate investment  partnerships for the occupancy of
the stores covered thereby. Such master lease agreements expired on December 31,
1998,  and were renewed  through  December  31, 2004.  We believe that the lease
agreements with the affiliated real estate investment  partnerships are on terms
comparable to those obtainable from third parties.

     We  believe  that  our  present  facilities  are  in  good  condition,  are
adequately insured and together with those under construction,  are suitable and
adequate for the conduct of our current operations.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

     We are a defendant in a lawsuit  entitled "Coalition  for a Level  Playing
Field,  L.L.C.,  et. al., v.  AutoZone,  Inc.,  et.  al.," in the United  States
District  Court for the Eastern  District of New York.  The over 100  plaintiffs
consist  primarily  of  warehouse   distributors  and  jobbers,  and  the  eight
defendants  are  principally   automotive   aftermarket  parts  retailers.   The
plaintiffs  allege  that  the  defendants  violated  certain  provisions  of the
Robinson-Patman   Act  by  receiving   and  inducing   various  forms  of  price
discrimination  from  manufacturers  of automotive  parts.  The plaintiffs  seek
compensatory  damages,  as well as injunctive and other  equitable  relief.  We,
along  with the other  defendants,  filed a motion to  dismiss  this  action and
subsequently,  on October 23, 2001, the court overruled a substantial portion of
the  defendant's  motion.  We believe the claims are without merit and that this
lawsuit will not have a material  adverse effect on our  consolidated  financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

     We were  involved in  litigation  as a result of a complaint  filed against
Hi/LO in May 1997.  The  plaintiff  in this  lawsuit  sought to  certify a class
action on behalf of persons or  entities in the states of Texas,  Louisiana  and
California that had purchased a battery from Hi/LO since May 1990. The complaint
alleged that Hi/LO  offered and sold  ''old,''  ''used'' and ''out of warranty''
batteries as if the batteries  were new,  resulting in claims for  violations of
deceptive trade  practices,  breach of contract,  negligence,  fraud,  negligent
misrepresentation  and breach of  warranty.  On January 15,  2001,  we reached a
favorable verbal settlement with the plaintiffs' counsel. The settlement,  which
was not significant and was accrued at December 31, 2001, and 2000, was approved
on October 18, 2001, by the 60th Judicial District Court of Texas.

     In addition, we are involved in various other legal proceedings  incidental
to the  conduct of its  business.  Although  we cannot  ascertain  the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters,  it does not  currently
believe that, in the aggregate,  they will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


Item 4. Submission Of Matters To A Vote Of Security Holders

     No matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders,  through  the
solicitation  of proxies or otherwise,  during the fourth  quarter of the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2001.

Item 4a. Executive Officers of the Company

     The following  paragraphs  discuss  information about executive officers of
the Company who are not also directors:

     Ted F. Wise, age 51, Co-President,  has been an O'Reilly team member for 31
of his 51 years.  He began his O'Reilly career in sales in 1970, was promoted to
store  manager  in 1973,  and  became our first  district  manager  in 1977.  He
continued  his  progression  through  the  ranks  as  Operations  Manager,  Vice
President, Senior Vice President focusing on Operations and Sales, and Executive
Vice President.  In July 1999, he was promoted to President of Sales, Operations
and Real Estate.

     Greg  L.  Henslee,  age  41,  Co-President,  has  been  with  the  O'Reilly
organization  for 16 years.  His O'Reilly career started as a Parts  Specialist,
and  during his first five years  served in several  positions  in retail  store
operations,  including  District  Manager.  From there he  advanced  to Computer
Operations  Manager,  and over the past ten years,  he has served as Director of
Computer Operations/Loss  Prevention,  Vice President of Store Operations and as
Senior Vice  President.  He has been in his current  position  as  President  of
Merchandise,  Distribution,  Information  Systems and Loss Prevention since July
1999.

     James R.  Batten,  CPA, age 39, has served as Chief  Financial  Officer and
Treasurer since March 1994 and, in addition,  as Vice-President of Finance since
October 1997.  Mr. Batten served as our Finance  Manager from January 1993 until
being elected to his current  position.  From September 1986 until joining us in
January 1993, Mr. Batten was employed by the accounting firm of Whitlock,  Selim
& Keehn.

Item 7(A). Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

At December 31, 2001, we had floating rate  obligations  totaling  approximately
$61,350,000  for  amounts  borrowed  under  our  revolving  line of  credit  and
long-term  debt.  These  floating  rate  obligations  expose  us to the  risk of
increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term rates. If the
floating  interest  rate  were to  increase  by 100  basis  points  (or 1%) from
December 31, 2001,  levels,  our interest  expense would  increase by a total of
approximately $51,000 per month.

behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

                                                       O'REILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion of our financial condition,  results of operations
and  liquidity  and capital  resources  should be read in  conjunction  with our
consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information
included elsewhere in this annual report.

     We are one of the largest  specialty  retailers of  automotive  aftermarket
parts, tools, supplies,  equipment and accessories in the United States, selling
our  products  to  both   do-it-yourself   ("DIY")  customers  and  professional
installers.  Our stores carry an extensive  product line  consisting  of new and
remanufactured  automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories,  and a
complete  line of autobody  paint and related  materials,  automotive  tools and
professional service equipment.

     Beginning in January 2000, we calculate  same-store  product sales based on
the change in product sales for stores open at least one year. We also calculate
same-store  product  sales  based on the change in  product  sales of only those
stores open during both full periods being compared. We calculate the percentage
increase in both same-store  product sales methods based on store sales results,
which exclude sales of specialty machinery,  sales by outside salesmen and sales
to employees.

     Cost of goods sold  consists  primarily of product  costs and warehouse and
distribution  expenses.  Cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales may
be  affected by  variations  in our product  mix,  price  changes in response to
competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs.

     Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expenses consist primarily
of store payroll,  store occupancy,  advertising expenses,  other store expenses
and general and administrative expenses, including salaries and related benefits
of corporate  team  members,  administrative  office  occupancy  expenses,  data
processing, professional expenses and other related expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies

     The  fundamental  objective  of financial  reporting  is to provide  useful
information  that allows a reader to comprehend  the business  activities of our
company. To aid in that  understanding,  management has identified our "critical
accounting  policies."  These  policies  have  the  potential  to  have  a  more
significant  impact  on  our  financials  statements,   either  because  of  the
significance  of the financial  statement item to which they relate,  or because
they  require  judgment  and  estimation  due to  the  uncertainty  involved  in
measuring, at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature.

o Cost  of goods sold - Cost  of goods sold includes estimates of shortages that
  are  adjusted  upon  physical  inventory  counts  in  subsequent  periods  and
  estimates of  amounts due  from  vendors  for certain  merchandise  allowances
  and  rebates. These estimates are consistent with historical experience.

o Operating,  selling,general and administrative  expense - Operating,  selling,
  general and administrative expense includes estimates for  healthcare/medical,
  workers' compensation and  other  general  liability  obligations,  which  are
  partially based on estimates of certain claim costs and historical experience.

o CreditOperations  - Allowance  for doubtful  accounts is  estimated  based on
  historical  loss  ratios  and  consistently  have  been  within   management's
  expectations.

o Revenue - We recognize sales upon shipment of the products. 24

Results of Operations

     The  following  table  sets  forth  certain  income  statement  data  as  a
percentage of product sales for the years indicated:



2001 Compared to 2000

     Product sales  increased  $201.7  million,  or 22.7% from $890.4 million in
2000 to $1.09 billion in 2001, primarily due to 121 net additional stores opened
during 2001,  an 8.8%  increase in  same-store  product sales for stores open at
least one year and the  acquisition of 82 stores in connection with the purchase
of Mid-State,  effective  October 1, 2001. We believe that the increased product
sales  achieved  by the  existing  stores  are the result of our  offering  of a
broader  selection of products in most  stores,  an  increased  promotional  and
advertising effort through a variety of media and localized  promotional events,
and continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores.
Also,  our continued  focus on serving  professional  installers  contributed to
increased sales.

     Gross  profit  increased  22.2% from  $382.7  million  (or 43.0% of product
sales) in 2000 to $467.8 million (or 42.8% of product sales) in 2001.

     Operating,  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses increased $61.3
million  from  $292.7  million  (or  32.9% of  product  sales) in 2000 to $354.0
million (or 32.4% of product  sales) in 2001.  The increase in these expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits,
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations.

     Other expense, net, increased by $234,000 from $6.9 million in 2000 to $7.1
million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased
debt levels  related to the issuing of $100 million of senior  notes,  partially
offset by lower  interest  expense  on  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit
facility due to lower interest rates.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $31.5  million in 2000 (37.8%
effective  tax rate) to $40.4 million in 2001 (37.8%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase  in the dollar  amount was due to the  increase in the amount of income
before income taxes.


                   O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries
  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

     Principally  as a result  of the  foregoing,  net  income in 2001 was $66.4
million (or 6.1% of product sales), an increase of $14.6 million (or 28.3%) from
net income in 2000 of $51.7 million (or 5.8% of product sales).

2000 Compared to 1999

     Product sales  increased  $136.3  million,  or 18.1% from $754.1 million in
1999 to $890.4 million in 2000,  due to 101 net additional  stores opened during
2000,  and a $28.0  million,  or 4.0% increase in  same-store  product sales for
stores opened in both full periods.  We believe that the increased product sales
achieved  by the  existing  stores are the result of our  offering  of a broader
selection of products in most stores,  an increased  promotional and advertising
effort  through  a  variety  of media  and  localized  promotional  events,  and
continued  improvement  in the  merchandising  and store layouts of most stores.
Also,  our continued  focus on serving  professional  installers  contributed to
increased sales.

     Gross  profit  increased  17.6% from  $325.3  million  (or 43.1% of product
sales) in 1999 to $382.7 million (or 43.0% of product sales) in 2000.

     Operating,  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses increased $44.3
million  from  $248.4  million  (or  32.9% of  product  sales) in 1999 to $292.7
million (or 32.9% of product  sales) in 2000.  The increase in these expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits,
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations.

     Other expense,  net, increased by $3.0 million from $3.9 million in 1999 to
$6.9  million in 2000.  The increase was  primarily  due to interest  expense on
increased borrowings under our credit facility.

     Provision  for income  taxes  increased  from $27.4  million in 1999 (37.5%
effective  tax rate) to $31.5 million in 2000 (37.8%  effective  tax rate).  The
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes.  The nominal  increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due
to changes in the  apportionment  of sales  between  states with  differing  tax
rates.

     Principally  as a result  of the  foregoing,  net  income in 2000 was $51.7
million (or 5.8% of product sales),  an increase of $6.1 million (or 13.3%) from
net income in 1999 of $45.6 million (or 6.1% of product sales).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Net cash provided by operating  activities was $50.0 million in 2001,  $5.8
million in 2000 and $31.6  million in 1999.  The  increase  in cash  provided by
operating  activities  in 2001 compared to 2000 is largely the result of smaller
increases in inventory,  increased net income, and to a lessor extent, increased
accrued benefits and  withholdings.  This increase in cash provided by operating
activities  in 2001  compared to 2000 was  partially  offset by the  increase in
amounts  receivable  from  vendors and a decrease in accounts  payable and other
current  liabilities.  The decrease in cash provided by operating  activities in
2000 compared to 1999 is the result of an increase in inventory, and to a lesser
extent,  increases in accounts  receivable and amounts  receivable from vendors,
partially  offset by  increases  in net  income,  accounts  payable  and accrued
payroll.

     Net cash used in  investing  activities  was $77.8  million in 2001,  $40.5
million  in 2000  and  $79.7  million  in 1999.  The  increase  in cash  used in
investing  activities  in 2001 was largely due to the  purchase of  Mid-State as
discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements,  and a significant
reduction  in the amount of proceeds  received  from the sales of  property  and
equipment. The decrease in cash used in 2000 compared to


                   O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries
  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

1999 was  primarily  due to proceeds  from the sale of 90  properties  for $52.3
million in a sale-leaseback transaction.

     On December 15, 2000,  we entered  into a $50 million  Synthetic  Operating
Lease Facility ("the  Facility") with a group of financial  institutions.  Under
the Facility,  the lessor  acquires land to be developed for O'Reilly Auto Parts
stores  and  funds  our  development  thereof  as  the  Construction  Agent  and
Guarantor.  We  subsequently  lease the property  from the lessor for an initial
term of  five  years  and  have  the  option  to  request  up to two  additional
successive  renewal  periods of five years each from the  lessor,  although  the
lessor is not obligated to grant us either renewal period. The Facility provides
for a residual value  guarantee of  approximately  $36.6 million at December 31,
2001, and purchase  options on the properties.  It also contains a provision for
an event of default  whereby the lessor,  among other things,  may require us to
purchase any or all of the properties.  We are utilizing the Facility to finance
a portion of our store growth.  Funding under the Facility at December 31, 2001,
and 2000, totaled $43.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively.

     On December 29, 2000, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction.  Under the
terms of the transaction,  we sold 90 properties,  including land, buildings and
improvements,  for $52.3 million.  The lease, which is being accounted for as an
operating  lease,  provides  for an  initial  lease  term of 21 years and may be
extended for one ten-year period and two additional  successive  periods of five
years each.  The  resulting  gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being
amortized  over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term
is  approximately  $5.5 million  annually and is included in the table of future
minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases. Proceeds
from the  transaction  were  used to  reduce  outstanding  borrowings  under our
revolving credit facility.

     In  August,   2001,   the   Company   completed   a   sale-leaseback   with
O'Reilly-Wooten  2000  LLC (an  entity  owned  by  certain  shareholders  of the
Company).  The transaction closed on September 1, 2001, with a purchase price of
approximately  $5.6  million  for nine  O'Reilly  Auto Parts  stores and did not
result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an
operating  lease,  calls for an initial  term of 15 years  with three  five-year
renewal options.

     Capital  expenditures were $68.5 million in 2001, $82.0 million in 2000 and
$86.0 million in 1999. These  expenditures were primarily related to the opening
of new stores,  as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing  stores.  We
opened 121, 101 and 80 net stores in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  We also
acquired  82 stores in  connection  with the  purchase of  Mid-State,  effective
October 1, 2001.  We  remodeled  or  relocated 16 stores in 2001 and 8 stores in
both 2000 and in 1999.  Four new  distribution  centers  were  acquired:  two in
October 2001, located in Nashville,  Tennessee and Knoxville,  Tennessee; one in
October 2000, located in Little Rock, Arkansas;  and the other in December 1999,
located in Dallas, Texas.

     Our  continuing  store  expansion  program  requires   significant  capital
expenditures  and working capital  principally for inventory  requirements.  The
costs  associated  with the opening of a new store  (including  the cost of land
acquisition,  improvements,  fixtures,  inventory  and computer  equipment)  are
estimated to average approximately $900,000 to $1.1 million; however, such costs
may be  significantly  reduced where we lease,  rather than purchase,  the store
site.  Although the cost to acquire the business of an independently owned parts
store varies,  depending  primarily upon the amount of inventory and the amount,
if any, of real estate  being  acquired,  we estimate  that the average  cost to
acquire  such a business  and  convert it to one of our stores is  approximately
$400,000.  We plan to finance our expansion  program through cash expected to be
provided from operating  activities and available  borrowings under our existing
credit facilities.

                   O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries
  Exhibit 13.1 - Portions of the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders (continued)

     On November 4, 1999,  the Board of Directors  declared a two-for-one  stock
split  effected  in the form of a 100% stock  dividend  to all  shareholders  of
record as of November  15,  1999.  The stock  dividend  was paid on November 30,
1999.

     In March 1999, we sold 7,002,000 shares of common stock through a secondary
public offering.  The net proceeds from that offering,  which amounted to $124.6
million, were used to repay a portion of our outstanding  indebtedness under our
bank credit facilities and to fund our expansion.

     In order to fund the Hi/LO  acquisition,  our  continuing  store  expansion
program and our working  capital and general  corporate  needs,  we replaced our
lines of credit in January 1998 with an unsecured,  five-year  syndicated credit
facility of $175  million.  The credit  facility  was reduced to $165 million in
1999, $152.5 million in 2000 and $140 million in 2001. The facility is currently
comprised of a revolving  credit facility of $125 million and a term loan of $15
million.  The credit  facility  is  guaranteed  by all of our  subsidiaries.  At
December 31, 2001, and 2000, $61,350,000 and $74,755,000,  respectively,  of the
revolving  credit facility and $15 million and $27.5 million,  respectively,  of
the term loan were  outstanding.  The credit  facility,  which bears interest at
LIBOR plus 0.50% (2.43% at December 31, 2001), expires in January 2003.

     Our contractual obligation, including commitments for future payments under
non-cancelable lease arrangements and short and long-term debt arrangements, are
summarized below and are fully disclosed in Notes 5, 6 and 7 to the consolidated
financial  statements.  We have not participated in, nor secured  financings for
any unconsolidated special purpose entities.



     We believe that our existing cash, short-term investments, cash expected to
be provided by operating activities,  available bank credit facilities and trade
credit will be sufficient  to fund both our  short-term  and  long-term  capital
needs for the foreseeable future.

Inflation and Seasonality

     We succeeded,  in many cases,  in reducing the effects of merchandise  cost
increases   principally  by  taking  advantage  of  vendor  incentive  programs,
economies of scale  resulting from  increased  volume of purchases and selective
forward  buying.  As a result,  we do not believe that our operations  have been
materially affected by inflation.

     Our business is somewhat  seasonal,  primarily as a result of the impact of
weather  conditions  on store sales.  Store sales and profits have  historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  (April through  September) of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters.

New Accounting Standards

     In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets,
effective  for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2001.  Under the new
rules,  goodwill  will no  longer be  amortized  but will be  subject  to annual
impairment tests in accordance with the Statement. Other identifiable intangible
assets will  continue to be  amortized  over their useful lives or, if they have
indefinite  lives,  such  identifiable  assets will not be amortized but will be
subject to annual  impairment  tests.  We will apply the new rules on accounting
for  goodwill and other  intangible  assets  beginning  in the first  quarter of
fiscal 2002.  Application of the provisions of the Statement are not expected to
have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Business

     O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. (''the  Company'') is a specialty  retailer and
supplier of automotive  aftermarket  parts,  tools,  supplies and accessories to
both the ''DIY'' customer and the  professional  installer  throughout  Alabama,
Arkansas,   Florida,  Georgia,   Illinois,   Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.

Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned  subsidiaries.  All significant  intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes sales upon shipment of products.

Use of Estimates

     The preparation of the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States  ("GAAP"),
requires  management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Inventory

     Inventory,  which  consists of automotive  hard parts,  maintenance  items,
accessories and tools,  is stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost has been
determined  using the last-in,  first-out  (''LIFO'')  method.  If the first-in,
first-out  (''FIFO'')  method of costing inventory had been used by the Company,
inventory would have been $442,529,000 and $369,869,000 as of December 31, 2001,
and 2000, respectively.

Amounts Receivable from Vendors

     Amounts  receivable  from  vendors  consist  primarily  of amounts  due the
Company for changeover merchandise,  rebates and other allowances.  Reserves for
uncollectible  amounts receivable from vendors are provided for in the Company's
consolidated financial statements and consistently have been within management's
expectations.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Property and Equipment

     Property and  equipment  are carried at cost.  Depreciation  is provided on
straight-line  and  accelerated  methods over the estimated  useful lives of the
assets.  Service lives for property and equipment  generally range from three to
forty  years.  Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  over  the  terms  of the
underlying  leases.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Upon  retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated  depreciation  are eliminated
and the gain or loss, if any, is included in the  determination of net income as
a component of other income (expense). The Company reviews long-lived assets for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

     The Company  capitalizes  interest costs as a component of  construction in
progress,  based on the  weighted-average  rates paid for long-term  borrowings.
Total interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, were $324,000, $1,354,000 and $1,134,000, respectively.

Income Taxes

     The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using the  liability  method in
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (''SFAS'') No. 109.
The  liability  method  provides that  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are
determined  based on differences  between  financial  reporting and tax bases of
assets and  liabilities  and are  measured  using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

Advertising Costs

     The Company expenses  advertising  costs as incurred.  Advertising  expense
charged to operations  amounted to  $12,796,000,  $12,150,000 and $9,428,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Pre-opening Costs

Costs  associated  with the opening of new stores,  which  consist  primarily of
payroll and occupancy costs, are charged to operations as incurred.

NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


Stock Option Plans

     The Company has elected to follow  Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No.
25,  Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees  (''APB  25''),  and  related
interpretations  in  accounting  for its  employee  stock  options  because,  as
discussed in Note 11, the alternative fair value  accounting  provided for under
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation requires the use of option
valuation  models  that were not  developed  for use in valuing  employee  stock
options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the Company's stock options
equals  the  market  price of the  underlying  stock on the  date of  grant,  no
compensation expense is recognized.

Earnings per Share

     Basic  earnings  per  share is based  on the  weighted-average  outstanding
common  shares.  Diluted  earnings  per  share is based on the  weighted-average
outstanding shares adjusted for the effect of common stock equivalents.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     The  Company  grants  credit to certain  customers  who meet the  Company's
pre-established  credit  requirements.  Generally,  the Company does not require
security when trade credit is granted to  customers.  Credit losses are provided
for in the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements and consistently  have
been within management's expectations.

     The Company has provided  long-term  financing to an unaffiliated  company,
through a note  receivable,  for the construction of an office building which is
leased by the Company (see Note 7). The note receivable, amounting to $1,991,000
and $2,066,000 at December 31, 2001, and 2000,  respectively,  bears interest at
6% and is due in August 2017.

     The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments,  including cash,
short-term  investments,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable and long-term
debt, as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets,  approximates
fair value.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made to the 2000  and 1999  consolidated
financial statements in order to conform to the 2001 presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets,
effective for fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 2001.  Under SFAS 142,
goodwill  will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual  impairment
tests in accordance with the Statement.  Other  identifiable  intangible  assets
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives or if they have indefinite
lives,  such  identifiable  assets will not be amortized  but will be subject to
annual  impairment tests. The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for
goodwill and other  intangible  assets  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
2002.  Application of the provisions of the Statement are not expected to have a
material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

NOTE 2-ACQUISITION

     On October 1, 2001, the Company  purchased all of the outstanding  stock of
Mid-State Automotive  Distributors,  Inc.  ("Mid-State") for approximately $20.5
million including  acquisition  costs.  Mid-State was a specialty retailer which
supplied   automotive   aftermarket  parts  throughout  certain  states  in  the
southeastern part of the United States.  The acquisition was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations of
Mid-State are included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The pro
forma effect on earnings of the acquisition of Mid-State are not material.

NOTE 3-SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

     The Company's short-term  investments are classified as  available-for-sale
in accordance with SFAS No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities,  and are  carried at cost,  which  approximates  fair market
value.  At December  31, 2001,  and 2000,  short-term  investments  consisted of
preferred equity securities.

NOTE 4-RELATED PARTIES

     The Company leases certain land and buildings  related to its O'Reilly Auto
Parts stores under six-year operating lease agreements with O'Reilly  Investment
Company  and  O'Reilly  Real  Estate  Company,  partnerships  in  which  certain
shareholders  of the Company are  partners.  Generally,  these lease  agreements
provide for renewal  options  for an  additional  six years at the option of the
Company.  Additionally, the Company leases certain land and buildings related to
its O'Reilly Auto Parts stores under 15-year  operating  lease  agreements  with
O'Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC, which is owned by certain shareholders of the Company.
Generally, these lease agreements provide for renewal options for two additional
five-year  terms at the option of the Company (see Note 7). Rent  expense  under
these operating  leases totaled  $2,894,000,  $2,671,000 and $2,647,000 in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

NOTE 6-LONG-TERM DEBT

     At December  31,  2001,  the  Company had  available  an  unsecured  credit
facility  providing  for maximum  borrowings  of $140  million.  The facility is
comprised of a revolving credit facility of $125 million, and a term loan of $15
million.  At December 31, 2000,  the Company had  available an unsecured  credit
facility  providing for maximum  borrowings of $152.5 million.  The facility was
comprised  of a revolving  credit  facility  of $125  million and a term loan of
$27.5 million.  At December 31, 2001,  and 2000,  $61,350,000  and  $74,755,000,
respectively,  of the  revolving  credit  facility  and $15  million  and  $27.5
million,  respectively,  of the term loan were outstanding. The credit facility,
which bears  interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% (2.43% at December 31, 2001),  expires
in January 2003.

     On May 16, 2001, the Company  completed a $100 million private placement of
two series of unsecured senior notes ("Senior Notes").  The Series 2001-A Senior

agreement allows for a total of $200 million of Senior Notes issuable in series.
Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce  outstanding  borrowings under
the Company's revolving credit facility.

     During 2001 and 2000, the Company leased certain  computer  equipment under
capitalized leases. The lease agreements are three-year terms expiring from 2001
to 2003. At December 31, 2001, the monthly  installments  under these agreements
were  approximately  $42,000.  The  present  value of the future  minimum  lease
payments under these agreements  totaled $860,000 and $2,232,000 at December 31,
2001, and 2000, respectively, which has been classified as long-term debt in the

Company purchased  $467,000,  $800,000 and $2,676,000,  respectively,  of assets
under capitalized leases.

     Additionally,   the  Company  has  various   unsecured   notes  payable  to
individuals and banks,  amounting to $251,000 and $97,000, at December 31, 2001,
and 2000, respectively.

respectively.

NOTE 7-COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

     During  1999,  the  Company  entered  into a Master  Lease  Agreement  with
O'Reilly-Wooten  2000  LLC (an  entity  owned  by  certain  shareholders  of the
Company)  related  to  the  sale  and  leaseback  of  certain  properties.   The
transaction  closed on January 4, 1999,  with a purchase price of  approximately
$5.5 million. The lease calls for an initial term of 15 years with two five-year
renewal options.

     On December 15,  2000,  the Company  entered  into a $50 million  Synthetic
Operating   Lease   Facility  ("the   Facility")   with  a  group  of  financial
institutions.  Under the Facility,  the lessor acquires land to be developed for
O'Reilly Auto Parts stores and funds the  development  thereof by the Company as
the  Construction  Agent and  Guarantor.  The  Company  subsequently  leases the
property from the lessor for an initial term of five years.  The Company has the
option of requesting up to two  additional  successive  renewal  periods of five
years each from the lessor,  although  the lessor is not  obligated to grant the
Company  either  renewal  period.  The Facility  provides  for a residual  value
guarantee of $36.6  million at December 31,  2001,  and purchase  options on the
properties.  It also  contains a provision  for an event of default  whereby the
lessor,  among other  things,  may require the Company to purchase any or all of
the  properties.  The Company is utilizing  the Facility to finance a portion of
its store  growth.  Funding  under the Facility at December 31, 2001,  and 2000,
totaled  approximately  $43.0  million and $1.0  million,  respectively.  Future
minimum rental  commitments  and the Facility have been included in the table of
future minimum annual rental commitments below.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 7-COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

     On December 29, 2000, the Company  completed a sale-leaseback  transaction.
Under the terms of the  transaction,  the Company sold 90 properties,  including
land,  buildings and improvements,  for $52.3 million. The lease, which is being
accounted  for as an operating  lease,  provides for an initial lease term of 21
years and may be extended for one ten-year period and two additional  successive
periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred
and is being  amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the
initial term is approximately $5.5 million annually and is included in the table
of future minimum annual rental commitments below.

     In  August,   2001,   the   Company   completed   a   sale-leaseback   with
O'Reilly-Wooten  2000  LLC (an  entity  owned  by  certain  shareholders  of the
Company).  The transaction closed on September 1, 2001, with a purchase price of
approximately $5.6 million for nine O'Reilly Auto Parts store and did not result
in a  material  gain or loss.  The  lease,  which has been  accounted  for as an
operating  lease,  calls for an initial  term of 15 years  with three  five-year
renewal options.

     The Company also leases certain office space,  retail stores,  property and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases. Most of these leases
include  renewal options and some include options to purchase and provisions for
percentage  rent based on sales.  At December 31, 2001,  future  minimum  rental
payments under all of the Company's  operating  leases for each of the next five
years and in the aggregate are as follows (amounts in thousands):


     Rental expense amounted to $25,122,000, $16,219,000 and $14,122,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Other Commitments

     The Company had construction commitments, which totaled approximately $22.3
million, at December 31, 2001.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 8-LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is a defendant  in a lawsuit  entitled  "Coalition  for a Level
Playing  Field,  L.L.C.,  et. al., v.  AutoZone,  Inc.,  et. al.," in the United
States  District  Court  for the  Eastern  District  of New  York.  The over 100
plaintiffs  consist  primarily of warehouse  distributors  and jobbers,  and the
eight defendants are principally  automotive  aftermarket  parts retailers.  The
plaintiffs  allege  that  the  defendants  violated  certain  provisions  of the
Robinson-Patman   Act  by  receiving   and  inducing   various  forms  of  price
discriminations  from  manufacturers  of automotive  parts.  The plaintiffs seek
compensatory  damages,  as well as injunctive and other  equitable  relief.  The
Company  and the other  defendants  filed a motion to  dismiss  this  action and
subsequently,  on October 23, 2001, the court overruled a substantial portion of
the defendant's  motion.  The Company  believes the claims are without merit and
that this  lawsuit  will not have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     The Company was  involved in  litigation  as a result of a complaint  filed
against  Hi/LO in May 1997.  The  plaintiff in this lawsuit  sought to certify a
class action on behalf of persons or entities in the states of Texas,  Louisiana
and  California  that had  purchased a battery  from Hi/LO  since May 1990.  The
complaint  alleged that Hi/LO  offered and sold  ''old,''  ''used'' and ''out of
warranty''  batteries  as if the  batteries  were new,  resulting  in claims for
violations of deceptive trade practices, breach of contract,  negligence, fraud,
negligent  misrepresentation  and breach of warranty.  On January 15, 2001,  the
Company reached a favorable verbal settlement with the plaintiffs'  counsel. The
settlement,  which was not significant and was accrued at December 31, 2001, and
2000,  was approved on October 18, 2001, by the 60th Judicial  District Court of
Texas.

     In  addition,  the Company is involved in various  other legal  proceedings
incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot ascertain
the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not
currently  believe that,  in the  aggregate,  they will have a material  adverse
effect on the  consolidated  financial  position,  results of operations or cash
flows of the Company.

NOTE 9-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company  sponsors a  contributory  profit sharing and savings plan that
covers  substantially  all  employees  who are 21 years of age with at least six
months  of  service.  Employees  may  contribute  up  to  15%  of  their  annual
compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum  limitations.  The Company
has agreed to make matching  contributions  equal to 50% of the first 2% of each
employee's contribution and 25% of the next 4% of each employee's  contribution.
Additional  contributions to the plan may be made as determined  annually by the
Board of  Directors.  After three years of service,  Company  contributions  and
earnings thereon vest at the rate of 20% per year. Company contributions charged
to operations amounted to $3,207,000 in 2001,  $2,454,000 in 2000 and $2,618,000
in 1999.  Company  contributions,  in the form of common  stock,  to the  profit
sharing and savings plan to match employee  contributions during the years ended
December 31 were as follows:


     Profit sharing  contributions  accrued at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
funded in the next year through the issuance of shares of the  Company's  common
stock were as follows:


     The Company also  sponsors a non-funded  non-contributory  defined  benefit
health care plan, which provides  certain health benefits to retired  employees.
According to the terms of this plan,  retirees'  annual  benefits are limited to
$1,000 per employee  starting at age 66 for  employees  with 20 or more years of
service.  Post-retirement benefit costs for each of the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000, and 1999, amounted to $12,000.

     Additionally,  the Company has  adopted a stock  purchase  plan under which
1,000,000  shares of common stock are reserved  for future  issuance.  Under the
plan,  substantially all employees and non-employee  directors have the right to
purchase shares of the Company's common stock monthly at a price equal to 85% of
the fair market value of the stock. Under the plan, 97,991 shares were issued at
a weighted-  average price of $22.13 per share during 2001,  147,315 shares were
issued at a  weighted-average  price of $12.83 per share during 2000, and 78,927
shares were issued at a weighted-average price of $18.90 per share during 1999.

     The Company has in effect a  performance  incentive  plan for the Company's
senior  management  under which 400,000 shares of restricted  stock are reserved
for future issuance.  Under the plan, no shares were issued to senior management
in 2001. In 2000 and 1999,  12,164 shares and 6,796 shares were issued under the
plan, respectively.

NOTE 10-STOCK OPTION PLANS

     The Company has a stock option plan under which  incentive stock options or
non-qualified  stock  options may be granted to officers and key  employees.  An
aggregate  of 6,000,000  shares of common stock is reserved for future  issuance
under this plan.  The exercise  price of options  granted shall not be less than
the fair  market  value of the stock on the date of grant and the  options  will
expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.  Options granted  pursuant
to the plan become exercisable no sooner than six months from the date of grant.
In the case of a shareholder  owning more than 10% of the  outstanding  stock of
the Company, the exercise price of an incentive option may not be less than 110%
of the fair  market  value of the stock on the date of grant,  and such  options
will expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.  Also,  the aggregate
fair market value of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are
exercisable  for the first time by any  individual  in any calendar year may not
exceed $100,000. A summary of outstanding stock options is as follows:


     Options to purchase  1,250,261,  1,729,033,  and 1,171,888 shares of common
stock were exercisable at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 10-STOCK OPTION PLANS (CONTINUED)

     The Company also maintains a stock option plan for  non-employee  directors
of the Company  under which  300,000  shares of common  stock are  reserved  for
future issuance.  All director stock options are granted at fair market value on
the date of grant and  expire on the  earlier of  termination  of service to the
Company as a director or seven  years.  Options  granted  under this plan become
exercisable  six months from the date of grant. A summary of  outstanding  stock
options is as follows:


     All options under this plan were exercisable at December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999.

     Pro forma  information  regarding  net  income  and  earnings  per share is
required  by SFAS  No.  123,  and has  been  determined  as if the  Company  had
accounted  for its employee and  non-employee  director  stock options under the
fair value method of that SFAS.

     The fair values for these options were estimated at the date of grant using
a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with  the  following  weighted-average
assumptions for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively:  risk-free interest rates of
5.16%,  5.02% and 6.54%;  volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Company's  common stock of .475, .442, and .247; and  weighted-average  expected
life of the options of 9, 8.9 and 8.0 years.  The Company  assumed a 0% dividend
yield over the expected life of the options. The weighted-average fair values of
options  granted during the years ended December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999,  were
$16.52,  $9.24  and  $10.22,   respectively.   The  weighted-average   remaining
contractual  life at December 31, 2001,  for all  outstanding  options under the
Company's stock option plans is 7.346 years. The weighted-average exercise price
for all  outstanding  options under the Company's stock option plans was $20.63,
$16.12 and $16.15 at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 10-STOCK OPTION PLANS (CONTINUED)

     The  Black-Scholes   option  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded options,  which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.   Because  the   Company's   stock   options  have   characteristics
significantly  different from those of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's opinion, the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

     For  purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period.  The Company's
pro forma information  follows:

NOTE 12-INCOME TAXES

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary  differences
between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows at December 31:

     A reconciliation  of the provision for income taxes to the amounts computed
at the federal statutory rate is as follows:



     The tax benefit associated with the exercise of non-qualified stock options
has  been  reflected  as  additional   paid-in   capital  in  the   accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

     During the years ended December 31, 2001,  2000, and 1999, cash paid by the
Company for income taxes amounted to $28,676,000,  $24,244,000 and  $17,151,000,
respectively.

NOTE 13-STOCK SPLIT

     On  November  8,  1999,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors   declared  a
two-for-one  stock split which was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend
payable  to all  shareholders  of  record as of  November  15,  1999.  The stock
dividend was paid on November 30, 1999.  Accordingly,  this stock split has been
recognized by  reclassifying  $254,000,  the par value of the additional  shares
resulting from the split, from retained earnings to common stock.

     All  share  and  per  share   information   included  in  the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements has been restated to reflect the retroactive
effect of the stock split for all periods presented.

NOTE 14-PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK

     In March  1999,  the  Company  completed  a  secondary  public  offering of
7,002,000 shares of common stock. Pursuant to this offering,  the Company issued
7,002,000  shares of common  stock  resulting  in net proceeds to the Company of
$124,570,000.  A  portion  of the  proceeds  was  used to  repay  the  Company's
outstanding indebtedness under its bank credit facilities. The remaining portion
of the proceeds was used to fund the Company's expansion.

                         Report Of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2001,  and 2000, and the
related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the  three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2001.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of O'Reilly
Automotive,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  at December 31,  2001,  and 2000,  and the
consolidated  results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the

principles generally accepted in the United States.

                O'REILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC. 1993 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     WHEREAS, O'Reilly Automotive,  Inc. (the "Company") has heretofore adopted,
and subsequently  amended the O'Reilly  Automotive,  Inc. 1993 Stock Option Plan
(the "Stock Option Plan"), under which shares of the Company's common stock, par
value $.01 per share (the  "Common  Stock"),  may be issued upon the exercise of
incentive and  nonqualified  stock options granted pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of the Stock Option Plan; and

     WHEREAS,  Article  VIII of the  Stock  Option  Plan  empowers  the Board of
Directors to alter and amend the Stock Option Plan; and

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has authorized the amendment
of the Stock Option Plan in order to accelerate  the  exercisablilty  of options
granted to employees of the Company who meet the  requisite  criteria upon their
retirement from the employ of the Company.

1.   The second  paragraph of Article IV, Section G, be and hereby is deleted in
     its entirety,  and the following  substituted in lieu thereof to constitute

     any time  within the  12-month  period  (three-month  period in the case of
     retirement  for Options that are Incentive  Stock  Options)  following such
     termination  of  employment,  but only to the  extent  that the  Option was
     exercisable  prior to such termination of employment.  Notwithstanding  any
     other provision contained in the Plan or the Agreements, if the termination
     of employment  is due to  retirement,  and such retiring  individual at the

     and (ii)  the sum of the  individual's  age and  years  of  service  to the
     Company is equal to or greater than eighty (80) years, then all outstanding

     immediately  exercisable within such 12-month period (three month period in
     the case of Options that are Incentive  Stock  Options)."

2. The provisions of this Amendment shall be effective as of the date hereof.

3.   Except and to the extent hereinabove set forth, the Stock Option Plan shall
     remain in full force and effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  this Amendment is dated as of the 9th day of February,
2002.
