ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix” or the
“Company”), a Delaware corporation founded on
April 17, 1989, is a leading supplier of access
infrastructure software and services that enable the effective
and efficient enterprise-wide deployment, management and access
of applications and information, including those designed for
Microsoft® Windows® operating systems, for UNIX®
operating systems, such as Sun Solaris™, HP-UX or
IBM®AIX® and for Web-based information systems, as
well as Web-based desktop access. The Company’s
MetaFrame® products permit organizations to provide secure
access to Windows based, Web-based and UNIX applications
regardless of the user’s location, network connection, or
type of client hardware platforms. The Company markets and
licenses its products primarily through multiple channels such
as value-added resellers, channel distributors, system
integrators and independent software vendors, managed by the
Company’s worldwide sales force. The Company also promotes
its products through relationships with a wide variety of
industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation
(“Microsoft”).

The Business Need for Simplified Access to
Information

Historically, information technology
(“IT”) has not been created, sold or implemented with
the total IT environment, from the enterprise perspective, in
mind. The IT environment in most organizations has expanded
incrementally over time. Each wave of computing over the past
three or four decades – mainframe, minicomputer, PC,
client-server, the Web, Java™, Web services – has not
superseded previous waves but, to some degree, has been added to
the systems that were already there. This is because many of
these technologies, which represent significant investments,
continue to provide “best-of-breed” capabilities,
economic return and strategic value.

Meanwhile, the

user

end of IT has grown
ever more dynamic and unpredictable. People often change roles
and locations, they typically use multiple access devices, and
they unpredictably switch from one network connection to the
next. Organizations need a consistent and coherent way to
connect these two zones of increasing complexity – the
application infrastructure side on the one hand, which is the
source of information

supply,

and the user side on the
other, which is the source of information

demand

. It is
vital for organizations to supply users, whether internal or
external, with fast, simple, secure, easy and instant access to
information and applications so that they can work effectively
and productively from virtually anywhere, on any type of device
or network connection. Organizations face significant roadblocks
to enterprise information access, which include:



•

Security.

Delivering
    sensitive business information to mobile workers, whether over
    the Internet or from within the enterprise, raises concerns
    about protecting data and ensuring privacy.

Access Infrastructure for the “On-Demand
Enterprise”

Citrix aims to address these challenges by making
it easy for people to access information on demand. The
Company’s mission is to make every organization an
on-demand enterprise where information is securely, easily and
instantly accessible from virtually anywhere using any device.
Citrix access infrastructure software enables organizations to
reduce the costs of corporate computing, increase employee
productivity, gain flexibility to technological change within
their data centers, improve resilience to business interruption
and gain greater control over the quality of enterprise IT
services. To become an on-demand enterprise requires that an
organization develop an

access strategy,

which is a
well-conceived approach to connecting information supply with
information demand that supports the inevitably increasing
complexity on both ends of the equation.

Access infrastructure, a common interface between
information supply and demand, is the embodiment of an access
strategy and the foundation of an on-demand enterprise. Access
infrastructure is a category of enterprise software that works
with application infrastructure – software used to create,
operate, integrate and manage application systems – and
includes a wide array of capabilities including:

In short, a single, integrated and consistent
access infrastructure for the enterprise:

•

Gives users secure, easy and instant access to
    enterprise applications, information, processes and people, from
    virtually anywhere, at anytime, using any device, over any
    connection.

•

Enables IT staffs to manage heterogeneity by
    centrally consolidating applications, simplifying their
    deployment, management, monitoring and measurement.

•

Ensures that only the right people have access to
    the right resources to protect the security of enterprise
    information assets.

The Citrix®

MetaFrame®

Access Suite Products

Citrix access infrastructure is packaged and sold
as the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite, which enables
organizations to provide a secure, single point of access to
enterprise applications and information on demand. The MetaFrame
Access Suite centralizes access to applications and information
and enables IT staffs to deliver, manage, monitor and measure
enterprise resources on demand. Citrix customers are able to run
IT as a corporate computing utility, providing software as a
service. This simplifies the complexity and reduces the costs of
deploying and administering hundreds of heterogeneous
applications and delivering them to users on demand virtually
anywhere, anytime, to any device, over any connection.



In the MetaFrame Access Suite, each component
product solves a particular access challenge for an
organization, while all of the products work together seamlessly
to enable the on-demand enterprise.

Collectively, these products accounted for
approximately 63%, 69% and 76% of the Company’s net
revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

•

Citrix Subscription
    Advantage

™.

To provide
    customers with the easiest and most convenient way to keep their
    Citrix software current, the Company markets software under the
    Citrix Subscription Advantage brand for an additional fee.
    Citrix Subscription Advantage is the Company’s terminology
    for post-contract support (“PCS”). Citrix Subscription
    Advantage is an annual, renewable program that provides
    subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades,
    enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become
    available during the term of their subscription. This product
    accounted for approximately 29%, 20% and 10% of the
    Company’s net revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

During February 2004, the Company acquired
Expertcity.com, Inc. (“Expertcity”), a market leader
in Web-based desktop access as well as a leader in Web-based
training and customer assistance products. As a result of this
acquisition, during 2004, Expercity will be integrated into the
Company as the Citrix Online



Division, and the Company’s portfolio of
access products will include the GoToMyPC® line of software
services that provide secure, browser-based access to desktop
PCs from virtually anywhere over the Web. In addition, the
acquisition will add the GoToAssist™ software service, that
will enable remote technical support for helpdesks and call
centers, corporate training, product demonstrations and customer
collaboration over the Web.

Citrix Services

Citrix provides a portfolio of services designed
to allow the Company’s end-customers and entities with
which it has a technology relationship to maximize the value of
Citrix access infrastructure software. These services are
available as a feature of the Company’s
business-development program and are available for additional
fees to end-customers.

•

Citrix Consulting.

The objective of Citrix Consulting is to help ensure the
    successful implementation of Citrix access infrastructure
    solutions. Tested methodologies, certified professionals and
    best practices developed from real-world experience allow Citrix
    Consulting to provide expert guidance and support to our
    partners and customers to maximize the effectiveness of their
    total application access strategy and access infrastructure
    environment.

•

Citrix Technical Support Services.

To accommodate the unique ongoing
    support needs of customers, Citrix Technical Support Services
    are specifically designed to address the variety of challenges
    facing application server software environments. Citrix offers
    five support-level options, global coverage and personalized
    relationship management.

•

Product Training & Certification.

A series of courses are designed to
    allow customers and channel members to learn new skills and
    effective strategies to help plan, implement and administer
    Citrix products. Students may attend courses at one of over 300
    Citrix Authorized Learning Centers™ (“CALC“s)
    worldwide.

Services revenue accounted for approximately 8%
of the Company’s net revenues in 2003 and 2002 and 7% in
2001.

Citrix Technology

Citrix products are based on a full range of
industry-standard technologies. In addition, some Citrix
products also include the Company’s proprietary
technologies known as the Independent Computing Architecture
(“ICA”) protocol, which allows an application’s
graphical user interface to be displayed on virtually any client
device while the application logic is executed on a central
server. Because the ICA® protocol moves client-based
application processing to the server, this approach enables
centralized management of applications, users, servers, licenses
and other system components for greater efficiency and lower
cost.

The Company’s ICA® technology also
minimizes the amount of data traveling across a user’s
network as only encrypted screen refreshes, keystrokes and mouse
clicks are transported to and from the client device. This
increases remote access security, improves application
performance and allows even wireless access to the latest, most
powerful applications and information.

Citrix products are also based on the
industry-standard Extensible Markup Language (“XML”).
Leveraging XML assures open systems interaction for customers
regardless of data source or platform. And by supporting XML,
which is the standard for future Web services-based
applications, Citrix helps customers get from the client/server
world of today to the Web services environments of tomorrow.

Citrix Customers

Citrix’s primary target markets for its
current products and services are large and medium-sized
organizations in the commercial, government and education
sectors. Currently, Citrix has more than 120,000 customers
worldwide, including 100% of the

Fortune

100, 99% of the

Fortune

500 and 95% of the

Financial



Times

FT Europe 100.
During 2003, Citrix’s enterprise customers included the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, DaimlerChrysler
AG, Target Corporation, Beverly Enterprises, Inc., IKEA
International A/S and Cargill, among others.

The Company’s software licenses are
generally perpetual and are offered in both “shrink
wrapped” and electronic-based forms. The Company
distributes its software using various formats including
traditional “boxed” packages for small projects and
customers, and electronically downloaded formats for its large
projects and customers.

For medium to large-sized projects, which
typically consist of large “multi-server”
environments, the Company offers electronic volume-based
licensing programs. These programs provide for enterprise
customer license arrangements that allow usage of the
Company’s products both on a department or enterprise-wide
basis. These licenses include electronically delivered
“software activation keys” that enable the feature
configuration ordered by the customer. Depending on the license
type and customer preference, the software media is delivered by
a channel distributor or directly by the Company. The Company
has invested, and continues to invest, in large-account
relationship professionals, license fulfillment channels and
entities with which we have service-oriented system integration
relationships to assist larger customers with broader usage of
the Company’s software infrastructure.

Technology Relationships

The Company has entered into a number of
technology relationships to develop customer markets for its
products, broaden the use of the ICA protocol as an emerging
industry standard technology for distributed Windows and non
Windows applications and to accelerate the development of its
existing and future product lines.

Microsoft.

Since its
inception, the Company has had a number of license agreements
with Microsoft, including licenses relating to Microsoft OS/2,
Windows 3.x, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT®, Windows
CE and Internet Explorer. These agreements have provided the
Company with access to certain Microsoft source and object code,
technical support and other materials.

In May 1997, the Company entered into a five-year
joint license, development and marketing agreement with
Microsoft, (as amended, the “Microsoft Development
Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company licensed its
multi-user Windows NT extensions to Microsoft for inclusion in
future versions of Windows NT server software. Pursuant to the
Microsoft Development Agreement, the Company’s multi-user
Windows NT extensions technology was incorporated into
Microsoft’s NT Terminal Server, which was released in July
1998, and Windows 2000 Server, which was released in February
2000.

In May 2002, the Company signed an agreement with
Microsoft to provide the Company with access to Microsoft
Windows Server source code for current and future Microsoft
Server operating systems, including access to Windows Server
2003 and terminal services source code, during the three year
term of the agreement. This agreement does not provide for
payments to or from Microsoft.

There can be no assurances that the
Company’s agreements with Microsoft will be extended or
renewed by Microsoft upon their respective expirations or that,
if renewed or extended, such agreements will be on terms
favorable to the Company. See “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
– Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results.”

Additional Relationships.

As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had entered into approximately 40 ICA license
agreements. Currently, numerous devices incorporate Citrix ICA,
ranging from Linux terminals to information appliances, such as
wireless phones and handheld devices. ICA licensees include Wyse
Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, Neoware, Fujitsu, and SAP AG,
among others.

In addition, the Citrix accessPARTNER network
includes Citrix Alliance Partners™ , which are a coalition
of industry-leading companies from across the IT spectrum who
work with the Company to design and market complementary
solutions for the Company and the customers of Citrix Alliance
Partners. The Company’s existing alliance and channel
programs, including the Citrix Business Alliance, are now
included



as part of the Citrix accessPARTNER network. For
further information on the Citrix accessPARTNER network see
“—Sales, Marketing and Support.” By the end of
2003, the number of Citrix Alliance Partners had grown to
approximately 1,400 members, including hardware, software,
global and regional consulting alliances. Citrix Alliance
Partners include Microsoft, Dell, IBM, EMC


,
Hewlett-Packard, Siebel Systems, PeopleSoft, SAP AG, Mercury
Interactive, Fujitsu, Verizon Wireless, Sprint PCS, Sun
Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices.

Research and Development

The Company focuses its research and development
efforts on developing new products and core technologies for its
markets and further enhancing the functionality, reliability,
performance and flexibility of existing products. The Company
solicits extensive input concerning product development from
users, both directly from end-customers and indirectly through
its channel distributors.

The Company believes that its software
development team and core technologies represent a significant
competitive advantage for the Company. Included in the software
development team is a group focused on research activities that
include prototyping ways to integrate emerging technologies and
standards into the Company’s product offerings, such as
emerging Web services technologies and Microsoft’s newest
Windows Server technologies. Other groups within the software
development team have expertise in XML-based software
development, integration of acquired technology, multi-tier
Web-based application development and deployment and secure
sockets layers-based (“SSL”) secure access. The
software development team also includes a number of key
employees who were instrumental in the release of
Microsoft’s Window’s NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition,
have expertise in current Microsoft and UNIX operating system
environments (Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and Linux), and were key
members from the engineering team that developed the original
version of OS/2 at IBM. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
incurred research and development expenses of approximately
$64.4 million, $68.9 million and, $67.7 million, respectively.

Sales, Marketing and Support

The Company markets and licenses its products
primarily through multiple channels worldwide, including value
added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators
(“SI“s) and independent software vendors
(“ISV“s), managed by the Company’s worldwide
sales force. The Company provides training and certification to
integrators, value-added resellers and consultants for a
full-range of MetaFrame-based application deployment and
management solutions and services through its accessPARTNER
network.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
relationships with approximately 100 distributors and
approximately 5,100 Citrix Solution Advisors worldwide. A number
of entities with which the Company has channel relationships
provide additional end-customer sales channels for the
Company’s products under either a Citrix brand or embedded
in the licensee’s own software product. For information
regarding entities with which the Company has technology
relationships, including Citrix Alliance Partners, see
“—Technology Relationships.”

The Company regularly takes actions to improve
the effectiveness of and strengthen its channel relationships,
including eliminating non-performing partners, adding new
partners with expertise in selling into new markets, and forming
additional relationships with global and regional SIs and ISVs.
In 2003, the Company particularly focused on streamlining and
simplifying sales processes, improving channel incentive
programs to reward solution-selling, and training. The Company
combined its existing channel programs, including the Citrix
Solutions Network™, into the Citrix accessPARTNER network,
a single, global network that spans the solution advisors, SIs,
value-added distributors, resellers, alliance partners, and
certified education professionals who advise on, sell, implement
and provide training for the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite and
related products and services. At the core of this community are
Solution Advisors – value-added resellers who deliver
strategic and successful access infrastructure solutions for
customers. SIs and ISVs are becoming a more central part of
Citrix’s strategy in the business and government markets.
The SI program includes members such as IBM, HP, Computer
Sciences Corporation, Electronic Data Systems Corporation,
Schlumberger, Siemens and Northrop Grumman. The ISV program has
a strong representation from targeted



industry verticals such as healthcare, financial
services and telecommunications. Members in the ISV program
include Amdocs, Cerner, Dell, McKesson, Siemens Medical Health
Solutions, Reynolds & Reynolds, ESRI and Ericsson.

The Company’s sales and marketing
organization actively supports its distributors and resellers.
The Company’s sales organization consists of field-based
systems sales engineers and corporate sales professionals.
Additional sales personnel, based in North America, Europe,
Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, support these field
personnel. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Results of Operations” and Note 12 to the Company’s
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding the Company’s geographic segments. These
additional sales personnel recruit prospective customers,
provide technical advice with respect to the Company’s
products and work closely with key distributors and resellers of
the Company’s products. During 2003 and 2002, the Company
grew its end-customer sales force of sales professionals that
work closely with medium and large enterprise customers to
achieve the appropriate combination of relationships for
licensing, integration and consulting to meet customers’
needs. These and other account penetration efforts are part of
the Company’s strategy to increase the usage of Citrix
software within the customer’s IT organization.

The Company’s marketing department provides
training, sales event support, sales collateral, advertising,
direct mail and public relations coverage to its indirect
channels to aid in market development and in attracting new
customers. In 2003, the Company launched its first-ever,
multi-million-dollar, worldwide advertising campaign. Beginning
September 2003, and extending throughout 2004, this multi-media
campaign combines CIO-targeted and customer-focused print, Web,
billboard and radio advertisements to raise Citrix’s brand
awareness using the CIOs of household-name customers to describe
the benefits of becoming an on-demand enterprise with Citrix
access infrastructure.

The Company provides most of its distributors
with stock balancing and price protection rights. These
transactions are estimated and provided for at the time of sale
as a reduction of revenue. Stock balancing rights permit
distributors to return products to the Company, subject to
ordering an equal dollar amount of other Citrix products. The
Company is not obligated to accept product returns from its
distributors under any other conditions, unless the product item
is defective in manufacture. Product items returned to the
Company under the stock-balancing program must be in new, unused
and unopened condition. Price protection rights require that the
Company grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of
Citrix products held by distributors or resellers if the Company
lowers its prices for such products. In the event that the
Company decides to reduce its prices, it will establish a
reserve to cover exposure to distributor inventory. The Company
has not reduced and has no current plans to reduce the prices of
its products for inventory currently held by distributors or
resellers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 2 to the
Company’s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding the Company’s revenue recognition
policy.

The majority of the Company’s service
activities are related to post-sale technical support, pre- and
post-sale consulting and product training services. Post-sale
technical support is offered through Citrix-operated support
centers located in the United States, Ireland, Tokyo and
Australia. In most cases, the Company provides technical advice
to channel distributors and entities with which the Company has
a technology relationship, who act as the first line of
technical assistance for end-customers. In some cases,
end-customers can also choose from a Citrix-delivered fee-based
support program ranging from one-time incident charges to an
enterprise-level support agreement covering multiple sites and
servers. In addition, the Company also provides free technical
advice through on-line support systems, including its Web-based
“Knowledge Center.” For pre- and post-sale consulting,
Citrix Consulting, a consulting services organization, provides
both exploratory and fee-based consulting services. These
services include on-site systems design and implementation
services targeted primarily at enterprise-level clients with
complex IT environments. Citrix Consulting is also responsible
for the development of best practice knowledge that is
disseminated to businesses with which Citrix has a business
relationship and end-customers through training and written
documentation. Leveraging these best practices enables the
Company’s integration resellers to provide more complex
systems, reach new buyers within existing customer organizations
and provide more sophisticated system proposals to prospective
customers. Training services for business, end-customers and
partners are provided through the Company’s



CALC program and eLearning. CALCs are staffed
with instructors that have been certified by Citrix and teach
their students using Citrix-developed courseware. Over 300 of
the world’s leading IT training organizations are CALCs.
eLearning is available through both CALCs and from Citrix’s
website.

Operations

The Company controls all purchasing, inventory,
scheduling, order processing and accounting functions related to
its operations. Production, warehousing and shipping are
performed internally in the United States and by independent
contractors on a purchase order basis in Ireland, depending upon
the customer’s geographic market. Master software CD-ROMs,
development of user manuals, packaging designs, initial product
quality control and testing are performed at the Company’s
facilities. In some cases, independent contractors duplicate
CD-ROMs, print documentation, and package and assemble product
to the Company’s specifications. To date, the Company has
not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the
manufacture and assembly of its products. Internal manufacturing
capabilities and independent contractors provide a redundant
source of manufacture and assembly.

The Company generally ships products upon receipt
of an order. As a result, the Company does not have significant
backlog at any given time, and does not consider backlog to be a
significant indicator of future performance.

Competition

As the markets for the Company’s products
continue to develop, additional companies, including Microsoft
and other companies with significant market presence in the
computer hardware, software and networking industries could
enter the markets in which the Company competes and further
intensify competition.

In addition, alternative products for secure,
remote access in the Internet software and hardware markets
directly and indirectly compete with the Company’s current
products and anticipated future product offerings. Existing or
new products that extend Internet software and hardware to
provide Web-based information and application access or
interactive computing can materially impact the Company’s
ability to sell its products in this market. The Company’s
competitors in this market include Microsoft, Oracle, Sun
Microsystems, Cisco, and other makers of secure remote access
solutions.

See “— Technology
Relationships” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future
Results.” The announcement of the release, and the actual
release, of products competitive to the Company’s existing
and future product lines, could cause existing and potential
customers of the Company to postpone or cancel plans to license
certain of its existing and future product offerings, which
would adversely impact the Company’s business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Proprietary Technology

The Company’s success is dependent upon
certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property.
The Company has been awarded a number of domestic and foreign
patents and has a number of pending patent applications in the
United States and foreign countries. The Company’s
technology is also protected under copyright laws. Additionally,
the Company relies on trade secret protection and
confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to
protect its proprietary technology. The Company has trademarks
or registered trademarks in the United States and other
countries, including Citrix®, ICA®, MetaFrame®,
MetaFrameXP®, GoToMyPC®, GoToAssist® and the
Citrix® logo.

While the Company’s competitive position
could be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary
information, the Company believes that because of the rapid pace
of technological change in the industry, factors such as the
technical expertise, knowledge and innovative skill of the
Company’s management and technical personnel, its
technology relationships, name recognition, the timeliness and
quality of support services provided by the Company and its
ability to rapidly develop, enhance and market software products



could be more significant in maintaining the
Company’s competitive position. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future
Results.”

ITEM  7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
    OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We develop, market, license and support access
infrastructure software and services that enable effective and
efficient enterprise-wide deployment, management and access of
applications and information, including those designed for
Microsoft Windows operating systems, for UNIX operating systems,
such as Sun Solaris, HP-UX or IBM-AIX, and for Web-based
information systems, as well as Web-based desktop access. Our
MetaFrame products permit organizations to provide access to
Windows based, Web-based, and UNIX applications regardless of a
user’s location, network connection or type of client
hardware platforms. We market and license our products primarily
through multiple channels such as value-added resellers, channel
distributors, system integrators and independent software
vendors, managed by our worldwide sales force. We also promote
our products through relationships with a wide variety of
industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation.

Acquisitions

Expertcity

On December 18, 2003, we entered into a
merger agreement with Expertcity.com, Inc.
(“Expertcity”), a market leader in Web-based desktop
access as well as a leader in Web-based training and customer
assistance products. On February 27, 2004, we acquired all
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Expertcity from
its stockholders by means of a merger of Expertcity and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of ours with Expertcity continuing as
the surviving corporation. Subsequently, Expertcity was merged
into Citrix Online LLC, our wholly-owned limited liability
company. The results of operations of Expertcity will be
included in our results of operations beginning after
February 27, 2004. We intend to continue Expertcity’s
business operations utilizing its assets and staff. The terms of
the merger and the consideration received by Expertcity’s
stockholders were the result of arm’s-length negotiations
between Expertcity and us. Prior to the merger, neither
Expertcity nor its stockholders had any material relationship
with us, our subsidiaries or any of our affiliates, officers or
directors or any associate of any of our officers or directors.

The consideration for this transaction was
approximately $231 million, comprised of approximately
$112.6 million in cash and approximately 5.6 million shares of
our common stock valued at approximately $118.4 million. The
merger agreement provides for additional purchase price
consideration of up to approximately 0.6 million shares of our
common stock to be issued to Expertcity stockholders in the
event certain revenue and other financial milestones are
achieved by the Expertcity business in 2004. For purposes of
calculating the number of shares of our common stock issued to
the Expertcity stockholders, the merger agreement provides that
shares of our common stock issued as initial consideration or as
additional purchase price consideration be valued on the average
closing price of our common stock for ten consecutive trading
days ending two trading days prior to the closing of the merger,
or approximately $20.12 per share. Additional purchase price
consideration earned by the Expertcity stockholders, if any,
will be calculated by dividing the amount earned pursuant to the
merger agreement up to a maximum of $12.0 million by
approximately $20.12 per share. The fair value of the shares
issued as additional purchase price consideration, if any, will
be based on the market value of our common stock at the date
that the shares are earned. In addition to the purchase price,
there were direct transaction costs associated with the merger
of approximately $4.0 million. Additional purchase price
payments, if any, and direct transaction costs associated with
the merger are expected to be recorded to goodwill. The sources
of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of
available cash and investments and our authorized common stock.

Independent valuation specialists are conducting
a valuation in order to assist us in determining the fair values
of a significant portion of Expertcity’s net assets. The
work being performed by the independent valuation specialists
was considered in our preliminary allocation of the purchase
price summarized below.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the
total estimated purchase price was allocated to
Expertcity’s net tangible and intangible assets based on
their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of
the acquisition. Due to the preliminary nature of the
allocation, amounts may be adjusted when



the valuation is finalized, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The estimated
purchase price is preliminarily allocated as follows (in
thousands):

Net assets acquired from Expertcity consisted
mainly of cash and investments, accounts receivable, deferred
revenues and other current liabilities.

The fair values used in the preliminary purchase
price allocation were based on estimated discounted future cash
flows, royalty rates and historical data, among other
information. The estimated purchased in-process research and
development is expected to be expensed immediately upon the
closing of the merger in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, interpretation No. 4,

Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business
Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method

due to the
fact that it pertains to technology that was not currently
technologically feasible, meaning it had not reached the working
model stage, did not contain all of the major functions planned
for the product, was not ready for initial customer testing and
had no alternative future use.

We expect to record approximately
$162 million of goodwill resulting from the acquisition,
which will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisitions Prior to 2003

In April 2001, we acquired Sequoia Software
Corporation for $182.6 million in cash. Sequoia provided
XML-based portal software. The Sequoia technology is a core
component of our MetaFrame Secure Access Manager software.

In February 2000, we acquired all of the
operating assets of Innovex Group, Inc. for approximately $47.8
million. On the date of the acquisition, we paid approximately
$28.9 million in cash, including closing costs. Under the terms
of the acquisition agreement, we were required to pay the
remaining purchase price, plus interest, if certain events
occurred. During 2001, these events occurred and, as a result,
we paid the remaining purchase price and the associated interest
of $10.5 million in cash in August 2001 and $10.7 million in
cash in February 2002. We have no remaining contingent
obligations related to this acquisition.

We accounted for the Sequoia and Innovex
acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion
No. 16,

Accounting for Business Combinations.

We
allocated the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values. In the Sequoia acquisition, a portion of the acquired
intangible assets were related to research and development that
had not reached technological feasibility and for which there
was no alternative future use.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and



related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We
base these estimates on our historical experience and on various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, and these estimates form the basis for our
judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We
periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on
available information and experience. Actual results could
differ from our estimates under different assumptions and
conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our
estimates, our financial condition and results of operations
could be materially impacted.

We believe that the accounting policies described
below are critical to understanding our business, results of
operations and financial condition because they involve more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is
deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to
be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly
uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different
estimates that could have been used, or changes in the
accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur
periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial
statements. We have discussed the development, selection and
application of our critical accounting policies with the audit
committee of our board of directors, and our audit committee has
reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting
policies in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Other significant accounting policies, primarily
those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed
below, are also critical to understanding our consolidated
financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial
statements contain additional information related to our
accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this
discussion.

Revenue Recognition.

The accounting related to revenue recognition in the software
industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules
and an understanding of industry practices, both of which are
subject to change. As a result, revenue recognition accounting
rules require us to make significant judgments. In addition, our
judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection,
which is generally based on evaluation of customer-specific
information, historical collection experience and economic
market conditions.

We sell most of our software products bundled
with an initial subscription for software license updates that
provide the end-user with free enhancements and upgrades to the
licensed product on a when and if available basis. Customers may
also elect to purchase technical support, product training or
consulting services. We allocate revenue to software license
updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement
based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair
value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the
applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition
criteria described above have been met. The balance of the
revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is
allocated to the delivered software product using the residual
method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the
software licenses are delivered. If we cannot objectively
determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on
VSOE, we defer revenue recognition until all elements are
delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value
can be objectively determined. We must apply judgment in
determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining
the VSOE of fair value for each element, considering the price
charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for
software license updates.

In the normal course of business, we do not
permit product returns, but we do provide most of our
distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and
price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit
distributors to return products to us, subject to ordering an
equal dollar amount of our other products. Price protection
rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for
inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if
we lower our prices for such products. We establish provisions
for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection
rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the
recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based
upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among
other things, recent and historical return rates for both
specific products and distributors, estimated distributor
inventory levels by product, the impact of any new product
releases and projected economic conditions. Actual product
returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions
incurred are, however, dependent upon future events, including
the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors



and the level of distributor inventories at the
time of any price adjustments. We continually monitor the
factors that influence the pricing of our products and
distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these
provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances
could differ from established reserves. Our ability to recognize
revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our
ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns. If
actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our
ability to estimate returns, we would be required to defer the
recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the
end-user. Allowances for estimated product returns amounted to
approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2003 and $10.5
million at December 31, 2002. The decrease in allowances
for estimated product returns is a reflection of the decrease in
stock rotation experience primarily due to a reduction in
packaged product inventory held by our distributors resulting
from an increase in enterprise customer license arrangements,
which are typically delivered electronically. We have not
reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for
inventory currently held by distributors or resellers.
Accordingly, there were no reserves required for price
protection at December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002.
We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
and incentive offerings including volume-based incentives. If
market conditions were to decline, we could take actions to
increase our customer incentive offerings, which could result in
an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the
incentive is offered.

Core and Product Technology Assets.

We review acquired core and product
technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by
comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized
cost of the technology. The core and product technology assets
acquired in our Sequoia acquisition form the basis for our
MetaFrame Secure Access Manager product. The recoverability of
this technology is primarily dependent upon our ability to
commercialize this product. The estimated net realizable value
of the purchased Sequoia technology is based on the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows associated with our MetaFrame
Secure Access Manager. Our revenues are forecasted based on
historical sales, data received from rate projections on our
installed customer base and estimates from our sales channels
and end-customer sales force. Our assumptions about future
revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated
with the forecast of MetaFrame Secure Access Manager. Actual
revenues and costs could vary significantly from these
forecasted amounts. As of December 31, 2003, we estimated
that the net realizable value of these core and product
technology assets is greater than the $14.9 million unamortized
cost of these assets. If these products are not ultimately
accepted by our customers, and there is no alternative future
use for this technology, we could determine that some or all of
the remaining $14.9 million carrying value of the related core
and product technology assets are impaired. In the event of
impairment, we would be required to incur a charge to earnings
that could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. On February 27, 2004 we acquired Expertcity,
which is expected to result in additional core and product
technology assets during the first quarter of 2004. For more
information see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –
Acquisitions.”

Goodwill.

At
December 31, 2003, we had $152.4 million in indefinite
lived goodwill primarily related to our acquisition of Sequoia.
We operate in a single market consisting of the design,
development, marketing and support of access infrastructure
software and services for enterprise applications. Our revenues
are derived from sales in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific regions. These three
geographic regions constitute our reportable segments. See note
12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information regarding our geographic segments. We evaluate
goodwill along these geographic segments, which represent our
reporting units. Substantially all of our goodwill at
December 31, 2003 was associated with our Americas
reportable segment.

On January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS
No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. As a
result of adopting SFAS No. 142, our goodwill is no longer
amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill
with a net book value at January 1, 2002 of $152.4 million,
including $10.1 million of acquired workforce previously
classified as purchased intangible assets. Excluding goodwill,
we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives.

We use judgment in assessing goodwill for
impairment. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or
sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based
on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our
management to be



consistent with industry discount rates and the
risks inherent in our current business model. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, we completed the required impairment tests of
goodwill at the date of adoption and annually as required. There
were no impairment charges recorded as a result of the adoption
of SFAS No. 142 or annual impairment tests. Due to
uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our
strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the
forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the
future, which could result in non-cash charges that would
adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

On February 27, 2004 we acquired Expertcity,
which is expected to result in additional goodwill during the
first quarter of 2004. For more information concerning the
acquisition of Expertcity, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Acquisitions.”

Current and Deferred Tax Assets.

We are required to estimate our income
taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part
of the process of preparing our consolidated financial
statements. At December 31, 2003, the Company has $54.7
million in net deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

requires a valuation
allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based
on the weight of the evidence, it is not more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized. Management reviews deferred tax assets periodically
for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding
the expected geographic sources of taxable income, gains from
investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the
need for a valuation allowance. We determined that a valuation
allowance of approximately $2.1 million relating to foreign tax
credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax
assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination
change in the future, we could be required to revise our
estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax
assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes. In
the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions
for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment
is required in determining the worldwide provision for income
taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our
estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as
appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments.
Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as
jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on
the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due
to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large
number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that
our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our
deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result
in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Stock-based Compensation Disclosures

Our stock option program is a broad based,
long-term retention program that is intended to attract and
reward talented employees and align stockholder and employee
interests. The number and frequency of stock option grants are
based on competitive practices, our operating results, the
number of options available for grant under our shareholder
approved plans, and other factors. All employees are eligible to
participate in the stock option program.

As of December 31, 2003, we had four
stock-based compensation plans. We grant stock options for a
fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal
to or above the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
As discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements,
we apply the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion
No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our
plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for
our fixed stock plans and our stock purchase plan. However, the
impact on our consolidated financial statements from the use of
options is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share in
the form of dilution.

The following table (in thousands, except option
price) provides information as of December 31, 2003 about
the securities authorized for issuance to our employees and
directors under our fixed stock compensation plans, consisting
of our Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Plan, the Third Amended
and Restated 1995



Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Amended and
Restated 1995 Non-Employee Director Option Plan and the Second
Amended and Restated 2000 Director and Officer Stock Option and
Incentive Plan:

The following table provides information about
stock options granted for 2003 and 2002 for employees,
non-employee directors and for certain executive officers. The
stock option data for listed officers relates to our Named

the year ended December 31, 2003, consist of our chief executive
officer, the four other most highly compensated executive
officers who earned total annual salary and bonus in excess of
$100,000 in 2003 and one other individual that would have
qualified, except that she was not an executive officer at
December 31, 2003. For further information on 2003 Named
Executive Officers, see our 2003 proxy statement that will be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission not later than
120 days after the close of our fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003. For 2002, the “Named Executive
Officers” consist of our chief executive officer and the
four other most highly compensated executive officers that
earned total annual salary and bonus in excess of $100,000 in
2002. The 2002 Named Executive Officers are identified in our
2002 Proxy Statement dated April 4, 2003. Named Executive
officers for both years presented were employees as of the
respective year end.

Condition and Results of Operations — Overview” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Which
May Affect Future Results,” which could impact our future
performance and financial position.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth our consolidated
statements of income data and presentation of that data as a
percentage of change from period-to-period.

*

not meaningful.

Net Revenues.

Our
operations consist of the design, development, marketing and
support of access infrastructure software and services that
enable effective and efficient enterprise-wide deployment and
management of applications and information.

Net revenues include the following categories:
Software Licenses, Software License Updates, Services, and
Other. Software Licenses primarily represents fees related to
the licensing of our MetaFrame products, additional user
licenses and management products (such as load balancing and
resource management products). These amounts are reflected net
of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return
rights. Software License Updates consists of fees related to our
Subscription Advantage program (our terminology for PCS) that
are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is
typically 12 to 24 months. Subscription Advantage is an
annual renewable program that provides subscribers with
automatic delivery of software upgrades, enhancements and
maintenance releases when and if they become available during
the term of the subscription. Services consist primarily of
technical support services revenue recognized ratably over the
contract term, revenue from product training and certification,
and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our
software products, which are recognized as the services are
provided. In May 1997, we entered into a five-year joint
license, development and marketing agreement with the Microsoft
Corporation, which expired in May 2002. Other represents the
royalty fees recognized in connection with the Microsoft
Development Agreement.



The $61.2 million increase in net revenues during
2003 was due primarily to a significant increase in revenues
from Software License Updates mainly due to the continued
acceptance of our renewable Subscription Advantage program. To a
lesser extent, the increase was due to an increase in Software
Licenses, primarily of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server,
particularly under enterprise customer license arrangements.
Also, the increase over 2002 was partially due to weakness
during 2002 in packaged product sales to our distributors and
resellers, associated with a reduction in packaged product
inventory held by our distributors and the overall weakness in
IT spending during 2002. These increases were partially offset
by a decrease in Other revenue associated with the expiration of
the Microsoft Development Agreement in May 2002. We currently
expect Software License Updates revenue to continue to increase
as we invest in customer care teams and other programs to
increase Subscription Advantage renewal rates in 2004. Also, we
currently expect Subscription Advantage to continue to be of
strategic importance to our business in 2004 because it fosters
long-term customer relationships and gives us improved
visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of
this revenue stream.

The $64.2 million decrease in net revenues during
2002 compared to 2001 was due primarily to a decrease in
Software Licenses due mainly to a decrease in revenue from
MetaFrame Presentation Server. This resulted from a decrease in
packaged product sales due to an overall weakness in IT spending
and a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our
distributors. The decrease in packaged product sales was
partially offset by an increase in Software License Updates due
to increased customer acceptance of our Subscription Advantage
program. In addition, the decrease in net revenue also resulted
from a significant decline in Other revenue due to the
expiration of the Microsoft Development Agreement in May 2002.

Deferred revenues, primarily related to Citrix
Subscription Advantage and Services revenues, increased
approximately $61.1 million compared to December 31, 2002. The
significant increase was due primarily to increased renewals of
Citrix Subscription Advantage, as well as an increase in
enterprise customer license arrangements, which typically result
in a greater portion of revenue being deferred. We currently
expect Citrix Subscription Advantage renewals to continue to
increase and as a result we currently expect deferred revenue to
also increase in 2004.

International and Segment Revenues.

International revenues (sales outside
of the United States) accounted for approximately 54.6% of our
net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 53.7% of
our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, and
48.0% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001.

An analysis of our geographic segment net revenue
as a percentage of net revenue is presented below:

(1)

Our Americas segment is comprised of the United
    States, Canada and Latin America.

(2)

Defined as Europe, Middle East and Africa.

(3)

Represents royalty fees in connection with the
    Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired during May 2002.

With respect to our geographic segment revenues,
the increase in net revenues during 2003 as compared to 2002,
was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all
geographic segments. The decrease in net revenues during 2002 as
compared to 2001 was due primarily to the factors mentioned
above, particularly in Europe and the United States. For
additional information on international revenues, please refer
to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.



Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues consisted primarily
of the cost of royalties, product media and duplication,
manuals, packaging materials and shipping expense. Cost of
revenues also consisted of compensation and other
personnel-related costs of generating services revenues. Our
cost of revenues excludes amortization of core technology, which
is shown as a component of amortization expense in our
accompanying consolidated statements of income. Cost of revenues
for 2003 remained relatively unchanged compared to 2002. During
2001, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system.
As a result of this implementation, we have an enhanced ability
to obtain information regarding personnel-related costs of
generating services revenues. The $10.8 million decrease in the
cost of revenues for 2002 as compared to 2001, is primarily
attributable to our ability to identify certain non-revenue
generating services expenses and classify such costs as
operating expenses. Enterprise customer license arrangements are
typically fulfilled with a nominal level of product media and
the licenses are delivered electronically. The cost of
fulfilling such sales is less than traditional packaged product
sales, thereby reducing costs of revenues as a percentage of
revenue. During 2004, certain royalty agreements are expected to
expire. Although these expirations are expected to reduce
certain costs of royalties, cost of revenues will fluctuate from
time to time based on a number of factors discussed above.

Gross Margin.

Gross
margin as a percent of revenue was 96.6% for 2003, 96.4% for
2002 and 95.0% for 2001. The increase in gross margin as a
percentage of net revenue from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to
the decrease in cost of revenues as discussed above. We
currently anticipate that in the next 12 months, gross margin as
a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively unchanged as
compared with current levels. During 2004, certain royalty
agreements are expected to expire; however, gross margin will
fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors
attributable to the cost of revenues as discussed above.

Operating Expenses.

As further discussed below, during
2002 we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately 10%
(approximately 200 employees) and consolidated certain functions
from our Salt Lake City, Utah and Columbia, Maryland facilities
into our Fort Lauderdale, Florida facility. As a result of such
actions, we incurred expenses of approximately $10.9 million,
primarily for severance and related facility expenses, of which
approximately $7.0 million were included in research and
development expenses, $2.8 million were included in sales,
marketing and support expenses and $1.1 million were included in
general and administrative expenses.

Our results of operations are subject to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to
minimize adverse impacts on our operating results, we generally
initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in
advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. As a result of
this policy, foreign currency denominated expenses will be
higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or
strength of the dollar in the prior year. Since the dollar was
generally weak in 2003, particularly against the Euro and
British pound sterling, we currently expect that operating
expenses will be higher in 2004 but further dollar weakness in
2004 will not have a further material impact on our operating
expenses until 2005.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses
consisted primarily of personnel-related costs. We expensed all
development costs included in the research and development of
software products and enhancements to existing products as
incurred except for certain core technologies with alternative
future use. Research and development expenses decreased
approximately $4.5 million during 2003, primarily due to
severance, relocation and reduced headcount costs and related
facility charges associated with the consolidation of our Salt
Lake City, Utah and Columbia, Maryland development teams into
our remaining engineering facilities in Fort Lauderdale, Florida
during 2002. These decreases were partially offset by an
increase in costs for external consultants and developers.

Research and development expenses increased
approximately $1.2 million during 2002 primarily from an
increase in staffing and associated salaries that primarily
related to the Sequoia acquisition in the second quarter of
2001, additional costs for severance for the worldwide workforce
reduction, and relocation and facility related charges
associated with the consolidation of our Salt Lake City, Utah
and Columbia, Maryland development teams into our remaining
engineering facilities during 2002. These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in costs for third party
software, external consultants and developers and a decrease in
personnel costs due to the worldwide workforce reduction.



Sales, Marketing and Support Expenses.

Sales, marketing and support expenses
increased approximately $17.4 million during 2003 primarily due
to increases in commissions and other variable compensation
costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals. In
addition, to a lesser extent, there was an increase in marketing
program costs resulting primarily from our launch of a worldwide
brand awareness and advertising campaign. To a lesser extent the
increase was due to increases in product training costs and
distributor commissions associated with the increase in our
software license updates. We currently expect sales, marketing
and support expenses to increase as we continue our worldwide
brand awareness and advertising campaign and invest in sales and
marketing initiatives.

Sales, marketing and support expenses increased
approximately $11.3 million during 2002 primarily from
additional end-customer sales personnel hired during 2001 and
2002 particularly for medium to large customers, an increase in
staffing and associated salaries related to the Sequoia
acquisition during 2001, and severance charges associated with
our worldwide workforce reduction. To a lesser extent, the
reallocation of certain non-revenue generating services expense
from cost of revenues to operating expenses also contributed to
the increase. The increase was partially offset by a reduction
in marketing costs due to a refocus in marketing programs
spending based on the current operating environment, and the
reallocation of certain overhead expenses to other departments,
primarily depreciation expense to certain general and
administrative cost centers.

General and Administrative Expenses.

General and administrative expenses
decreased approximately $3.3 million during 2003 due primarily
to a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from asset
maturities and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements
during 2002 and a decrease in our provision for doubtful
accounts. These decreases were partially offset by an increase
in incentive compensation resulting from the achievement of our
financial targets and an increase in insurance costs.

General and administrative expenses increased
approximately $3.7 million during 2002 primarily from a
reallocation of certain overhead expenses from other departments
to general and administrative expenses, primarily depreciation
expense from certain sales, marketing and support cost centers
into certain general and administrative cost centers.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

The $37.5 million decrease in
amortization of intangible assets during 2002 was substantially
due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which requires that we
no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives but subject them to an annual impairment test.
Other intangibles of $36.6 million at January 1, 2002
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. As of
December 31, 2003, we had unamortized identified intangible
assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of $21.3
million. Amortization expense totaled $11.3 million during 2003
and 2002 and $48.8 million during 2001. We currently expect
amortization expense to increase during 2004 as a result of our
acquisition of Expertcity. For more information regarding the
Expertcity acquisition see, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Acquisitions” and note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements.

In-Process Research and Development.

In April 2001, we acquired Sequoia,
for which $2.6 million of the purchase price was allocated to
in-process research and development, or IPR&D. The amounts
allocated to IPR&D had not yet reached technological
feasibility, had no alternative future use and were written off
at the time of the acquisition. There were no write-offs of
IPR&D during 2003 and 2002. As a result of the Expertcity
acquisition in February 2004, we allocated approximately $20
million to IPR&D that was written off at the closing of the
acquisition. For more information regarding the acquisition, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations —
Acquisitions” and note 17 to our consolidated financial
statements.

Interest Income.

Interest income decreased
approximately $9.8 million during 2003 and approximately $11.1
million during 2002 primarily due to decreases in interest
rates. During 2002, we terminated an interest rate swap
agreement with a notional amount of $174.6 million and in
December 2002, we sold the investments underlying this swap
agreement. As a result, the decrease in interest income during
2002 was partially offset by interest income of approximately
$3.4 million recognized as a result of the termination of this
interest rate swap and the hedging relationship. For more
information see “–Liquidity and Capital
Resources” and note 13



to our consolidated financial statements. During
the first quarter of 2004, we currently expect to use cash of
approximately $355.7 million for the redemption of our
convertible subordinated debentures, and we paid approximately
$112.6 million in cash for the Expertcity acquisition.
Accordingly, we currently believe that our lower cash balances
during 2004 will significantly reduce our interest income during
2004. For more information see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations Acquisitions” and “–Liquidity and
Capital Resources” and note 17 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense remained relatively
unchanged during 2003 compared to 2002 and primarily represented
non-cash interest accretion on our convertible subordinated
debentures. The $2.4 million decrease in interest expense for
2002 as compared to 2001 was due primarily to interest expense
incurred during 2001 on contingent payments associated with the
Innovex acquisition. We currently expect interest expense to
decrease substantially during 2004 due to the anticipated
redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures. For more
information see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations–Acquisitions” and “ – Liquidity
and Capital Resources” and note 17 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

Other income (expense), net is
primarily comprised of remeasurement and foreign currency
transaction gains (losses), other-than-temporary declines in the
value of our equity investments and realized gains
(losses) on the sale of available-for-sale investments. The
$6.9 million increase in other income (expense), net during 2003
compared to 2002 was due primarily to a decline in remeasurement
and foreign currency transaction losses, as well as, realized
gains on the sale of certain of our available-for-sale
investments. The $1.2 million decrease in other income
(expense), net for 2002 as compared to other income (expense),
net in 2001 was the result of $2.1 million of losses from
other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain of
our equity investments and realized losses on the sale of
available-for-sale securities, as well as approximately $1.1
million in remeasurement and foreign currency transaction
losses. In March 2004, we expect to incur a charge of
approximately $7.2 million for our remaining prepaid issuance
costs as a result of the redemption of our convertible
subordinated debentures. For more information on our convertible
subordinated debentures see “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity” and note 9 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Income Taxes.

We
maintain certain operational and administrative processes in
overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at
lower foreign tax rates. We do not expect to remit earnings from
our foreign subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate increased to
21% in 2003 from 17% in 2002 primarily due to an increase in
annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed
at a higher rate. We currently expect our effective tax rate for
2004 to be approximately 22%; however our effective tax rate may
fluctuate throughout 2004 based on a number of factors including
variations in estimated taxable income in our geographic
locations, completed and potential acquisitions and changes in
statutory tax rates, among others.

The decrease in the effective tax rate from 31%
in 2001 to 17% in 2002 was due primarily to the adoption of SFAS
No. 142, pursuant to which amortization of goodwill, which
previously increased taxable income in the determination of our
effective tax rate, ceased. The reduction in the tax rate was
also due to higher tax credits related to our foreign operations
and research and development, and the cessation of revenues from
the Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2003, we generated positive operating cash
flows of $255.4 million. These cash flows related primarily to
net income of $126.9 million, adjusted for, among other things,
tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock options
and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of
$10.3 million, non-cash charges, including depreciation and
amortization expenses of $34.3 million, the accretion of
original issue discount and amortization of financing costs on
our convertible subordinated debentures of $18.2 million and an
aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and
liabilities of $60.9 million, primarily resulting from an
increase in deferred revenues due to the success of our
Subscription Advantage program. Our investing activities
provided $26.7 million of cash consisting primarily of the net
proceeds, after reinvestment, from sales and maturities of
investments of $40.7 million, partially offset by the
expenditure of $11.1 million



for the purchase of property and equipment. Our
financing activities used cash of $65.5 million related
primarily to the expenditure of $124.6 million for the stock
repurchase program, partially offset by the proceeds received
from employee stock compensation plans of $58.4 million.

During 2002, we generated positive operating cash
flows of $187.1 million. These cash flows related primarily to
net income of $93.9 million, adjusted for, among other things,
tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock options
and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of
$25.7 million, non-cash charges, including depreciation and
amortization expenses of $41.4 million, provisions for product
returns of $25.3 million (primarily due to our stock rotation
program) and the accretion of original issue discount and
amortization of financing costs on our convertible subordinated
debentures of $17.7 million. These cash inflows were partially
offset by an aggregate decrease in cash flow from our operating
assets and liabilities of $16.9 million. Our investing
activities provided $0.1 million of cash consisting primarily of
the net proceeds, after reinvestment, from sales and maturities
of investments of $29.0 million, offset by the expenditure of
$19.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment and net
cash paid for acquisitions (a contingent payment resulting from
the February 2000 Innovex acquisition) of approximately $10.7
million. Our financing activities used cash of $184.2 million
related primarily to the expenditure of $192.1 million for the
stock and debt repurchase programs, partially offset by the
proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and the
sale of put warrants of $8.0 million.

Cash and Investments

As of December 31, 2003, we had $898.3
million in cash and investments, including $359.3 million in
cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had $183.5 million in
working capital at December 31, 2003. The $178.9 million
increase in cash and investments as compared to
December 31, 2002, is due primarily to positive cash flow
from operations and stock option exercises, partially offset by
common stock repurchases and capital expenditures. We generally
invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade, highly
liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of
immediate cash needs. Our short and long-term investments, other
than $0.3 million of equity investments, consist of interest
bearing securities. For more information on our cash and
investments balances see “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –
Certain Factors that May Affect Future Results” and notes 4
and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

Included in short-term investments, we have two
AAA-rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as
held-to-maturity investments that are carried at the combined
accreted value of approximately $192.5 million at
December 31, 2003. These securities mature on
March 22, 2004. We do not recognize changes in fair value
of the held-to-maturity investment unless a decline in the fair
value is other-than-temporary, in which case we would recognize
a loss in earnings. There have been no losses associated with
the corporate securities to date. At December 31, 2003, the
fair value of the securities was $194.5 million and at
December 31, 2002 the fair value of these securities was
$180.2 million.

In November 2001, we entered into an interest
rate swap agreement with a notional amount of approximately
$174.6 million. The interest rate swap agreement hedged a like
amount of floating rate notes in our investment portfolio. Upon
termination in 2002 of this interest rate swap agreement and the
sale of the underlying investments, we received a cash payment
of $9.2 million as settlement under the swap agreement,
recognized the gain of approximately $2.4 million in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes.

Accounts Receivable, Net

At December 31, 2003, we had approximately
$87.5 million in accounts receivable, net of allowances. The
increase in accounts receivable as compared to 2002 is primarily
attributed to an increase in sales, particularly in the last
month of the quarter and a decrease in the allowance for returns
reflective of the decrease in stock rotation experience. We have
experienced a decrease in stock rotation, primarily due to a
reduction in packaged product inventory held by our
distributors. Our provision for doubtful accounts also decreased
as compared to 2002 due to account write-offs in 2003 of amounts
specifically reserved in 2002.



From time to time, we could maintain individually
significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors
or customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises,
governments and small and medium-sized businesses. If the
financial condition of our distributors or customers
deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected.
During 2003 and 2002, no distributor or customer accounted for
more than 10% of our accounts receivable. For more information
regarding significant customers see note 12 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Convertible Subordinated Debentures

In March 1999, we sold $850 million principal
amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures, due in March 2019, in a private placement. The
debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.25%. Our
net proceeds were approximately $291.9 million, net of original
issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of $9.6 million.
Except under limited circumstances, we will pay no interest
prior to maturity. The security holders can convert the
debentures at any time on or before the maturity date at a
conversion rate of 14.0612 shares of our common stock for each
$1,000 principal amount at maturity of the debentures, subject
to adjustment in certain events. We can redeem the debentures on
or after March 22, 2004, and the holders of the debentures
can require us to repurchase the debentures on fixed dates and
at set redemption prices (equal to the issue price plus accrued
original issue discount) beginning on March 22, 2004.
Accordingly, we classified the debentures as a current liability
on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect the amount that
will be payable on demand within one year of the balance sheet
date.

In 2000, our board of directors approved a
program authorizing us to spend up to $25 million to repurchase
debentures in open market purchases. Additionally, in 2002 our
board of directors granted us the additional authority to
repurchase up to $100 million in debentures through private
transactions, bringing our total repurchase authority up to $125
million. During 2002, we repurchased 76,000 units for
approximately $29.9 million, which represents $76.0 million in
principal amount at maturity. During 2002, we adopted SFAS
No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44,
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections

earlier than required, and therefore we recorded
an operating gain of approximately $1.6 million during 2002 as a
result of our debenture repurchases. The board of
directors’ limited authorization to repurchase the
debentures allows us to repurchase debentures when market
conditions are favorable. There were no debenture repurchases
during 2003.

On February 19, 2004, we notified all
holders of our debentures of our intent to call all of the
outstanding debentures on March 22, 2004. As of the notice
date, debentures in an aggregate principal amount of
approximately $773.8 million were outstanding. The aggregate
redemption price of the debentures will be approximately $355.7
million. We currently intend to use the proceeds from the
maturity of our two AAA-rated zero coupon corporate securities
classified as held-to-maturity investments that mature on
March 22, 2004 to fund the majority of the aggregate
redemption price. We believe that our cash on hand and the sale
of certain of our available-for-sale investments will be
sufficient to fund the balance of the aggregate redemption
price. Additionally, at the date of redemption, we will incur a
charge for the associated prepaid debt issuance costs of
approximately $7.2 million, which will be reflected in other
income (expense), net in March 2004. See “—Cash and
Investments” above.

Stock Repurchase Program

In April 1999, our board of directors authorized
an ongoing stock repurchase program. During 2003, our board of
directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $200
million under our stock repurchase program, increasing the total
authority to $800 million, the objective of which is to manage
actual and anticipated dilution. At December 31, 2003,
approximately $163.9 million was available to repurchase common
stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares
repurchased are recorded as treasury stock.

We are authorized to make open market purchases
of our common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally,
from time to time, we have entered into structured stock
repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using
general corporate funds as part of our share repurchase program
in order to lower



our average cost to acquire shares. Some of these
programs include terms that require us to make up front payments
to the counter-party financial institution and result in the
receipt of shares or a return of our payments at the maturity of
the agreement, depending on market conditions. We have also sold
put warrants that entitled the holder of each warrant to sell to
us, generally by physical delivery, one share of our common
stock at a specified price.

The terms of certain put warrants and other
repurchase transactions outstanding at December 31, 2002
required that put warrants and common stock subject to
repurchase be presented separately in our December 31, 2002
balance sheet. Upon settlement, the 2002 transactions were
reclassified to stockholders’ equity when the transactions
matured or expired. There were no put warrant obligations
outstanding at December 31, 2003.

We expended an aggregate of $123.9 million and
$161.1 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively, net of
premiums received, under all stock repurchase transactions.
During 2003, we took delivery of a total of 8,859,381 shares of
outstanding common stock with an average per share price of
$15.86; and during 2002, we took delivery of a total of
17,840,197 shares of outstanding common stock with an average
per share price of $11.83. Some of these shares were received
pursuant to prepaid programs. Since inception of our stock
repurchase programs, the average cost of shares acquired was
$16.28 per share compared to an average close price during open
trading windows of $19.57 per share. As of December 31,
2003, we are a party to a contract that expires on or before
March 29, 2004, and provides that for up front payments of $40
million, we will receive a number of shares at monthly intervals
based on the average closing price during the contract term less
a specified discount. Due to the fact that the total shares to
be received for the open repurchase agreements at December 31,
2003 is not determinable until the contracts mature in 2004, the
above price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares
subject to the agreements.

During 2003 and 2002, significant portions of our
cash inflows were generated by our operations. We currently
expect this trend to continue throughout 2004. In February 2004
we paid cash of approximately $112.6 million in connection with
the closing of the acquisition of Expertcity. In March 2004, we
currently expect to pay in cash approximately $355.7 million for
the redemption of our outstanding debentures. Although these
commitments will significantly deplete our existing cash and
investments, we believe the balance of our existing cash and
investments together with cash flow expected from operations
will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure
requirements and the payment of the cash portion of any
acquisition commitments for the next 12 months. Future
operating results and expected cash flow from operations could
vary if we experience a decrease in customer demand or a
decrease in customer acceptance of future product offerings. We
could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through
the issuance of debt or equity securities. We continue to search
for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make
investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic
objectives. Such investments could reduce our available working
capital.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangement

Contractual Obligations

We have certain contractual obligations that are
recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial
statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations,
are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial
statements, but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our
consolidated financial statements.



The following table summarizes our significant
contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 and the future
periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in
cash. Additional details regarding these obligations are
provided in the footnotes to our consolidated financial
statements (in thousands):

(1)

This is the expected cash payment we will make
    when we exercise the call option on the debentures. For more
    information see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –
    Liquidity – Convertible Subordinated Debentures” and
    note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

(2)

Total contractual obligations do not include
    agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where
    cancellation without payment provisions exist.

As of December 31, 2003, we did not have any
material long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations,
purchase obligations, or other material long-term commitments
reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement

We are a party to a synthetic lease arrangement
totaling approximately $61.0 million for our corporate
headquarters office space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The
synthetic lease represents a form of off-balance sheet financing
under which an unrelated third party lessor funded 100% of the
costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us. The
synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting
purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes. We do not
include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a
liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Consequently, payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded
as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income.
We entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our
headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under
our previous lease arrangements. We do not materially rely on
off-balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital
resources. For information regarding cash outflows associated
with our lease payments see “– Contractual
Obligations.”

The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven
years. Upon approval by the lessor, we can renew the lease twice
for additional two-year periods. The lease payments vary based
on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin.
At any time during the lease term, we have the option to
sublease the property and upon thirty-days’ written notice,
we have the option to purchase the property for an amount
representing the original property cost and transaction fees of
approximately $61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and
outstanding amounts owed. Upon at least 180 days notice
prior to the termination of the initial lease term, we have the
option to remarket the property for sale to a third party. If we
choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease
term, we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of
approximately $51.9 million and possession of the buildings will
be returned to the lessor. If the fair value of the building
were to decline below $51.9 million, we would have to make up
the difference under our residual value guarantee, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

The synthetic lease includes certain financial
covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a pledged
balance of approximately $63.0 million in cash and/or investment
securities as collateral. We manage the composition of the
pledged investments and investment earnings are available for
operating purposes. Additionally, we must maintain a minimum net
cash and investment balance, less our debentures, collateralized
investments and equity investments, of $100.0 million, as of the
end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately $300.1 million in cash and investments in excess
of those required



levels. The synthetic lease includes
non-financial covenants, including the maintenance of the
properties and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of financial
statements to the lender of the lessor and prompt payment of
taxes associated with the properties. As of December 31,
2003, we were in compliance with all material provisions of the
arrangement.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation, or FIN, No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,

which addresses the
consolidation of variable interest entities in which an
enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected
losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected
residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual
or other financial interests in the entity. In December 2003,
the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised), which replaced FIN
No. 46. FIN No. 46 (revised) is effective
immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable
interest entities referred to as special-purpose entities for
periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for other types
of entities for financial statements for periods ending after
March 15, 2004. We determined that we are not required to
consolidate the lessor, the leased facility or the related debt
associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with FIN
No. 46, as amended. Accordingly, there was no impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows from
adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of
the property or significantly change its ownership of other
properties that it currently holds, we could be required to
consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt in a
future period.

Commitments

Capital expenditures were $11.1 million during
2003, $19.1 million during 2002 and $60.6 million during 2001.
During 2003, capital expenditures were primarily related to
computer equipment purchases associated with our research and
development activities. The decrease compared to 2002 is due to
expenditures in 2002 for leasehold improvements on newly
occupied buildings. In the normal course of business, we enter
into commitments related to capital expenditures, however, we
currently have no material contractual commitments for capital
expenditures over the next 12 months.

During 2002 and 2001, we took actions to
consolidate certain of our offices, including the exit of
certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain
leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these
existing operating leases continue to October 2025 with a total
remaining obligation of approximately $29.7 million, of which
$4.8 million, net of anticipated sublease income, was accrued
for as of December 31, 2003, and is reflected in accrued
expenses in our consolidated financial statements. In
calculating this accrual, we made estimates, based on market
information, including the estimated vacancy periods and
sublease rates and opportunities. If actual circumstances prove
to be materially worse than management has estimated, the total
charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly
higher.

In February 2004, we acquired Expertcity for
approximately $231 million, comprised of approximately
$112.6 million in cash and approximately 5.6 million
shares of our common stock valued at approximately
$118.4 million. Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, we will be required to issue up to approximately an
additional 0.6 million in our common stock if certain financial
targets are achieved by the Expertcity business in 2004. For
more information regarding the acquisition, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis —
Acquisitions.”

Certain Factors Which May Affect Future
Results

Our operating results and financial condition
have varied in the past and could in the future vary
significantly depending on a number of factors. From time to
time, information provided by us or statements made by our
employees contain “forward-looking” information that
involves risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements
contained in this Form 10-K, and in the documents
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, that are not
historical facts, including, but not limited to statements
concerning new products, product development and offerings,
Subscription Advantage, product and price competition,
Expertcity, competition and strategy, product price and
inventory, deferred revenues, economic and market conditions,
revenue recognition, profits, growth of revenues, cost of
revenues, operating expenses, royalty arrangements, sales,
marketing and support expenses, valuations of investments and
derivative instruments, technology



relationships, reinvestment of foreign earnings,
gross margins, intangible assets, impairment charges,
anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements,
in-process research and development, advertising campaigns, tax
rates, leasing and subleasing activities, acquisitions, debt
redemption obligations, stock repurchases, investment
transactions, liquidity, working capital, litigation matters,
intellectual property matters, distribution channels, stock
price, licensing models and potential debt or equity financings
constitute forward-looking statements and are made under the
safe harbor provisions of the Section 27 of the Securities
Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are neither
promises nor guarantees. Our actual results of operations and
financial condition have varied and could in the future vary
significantly from those stated in any forward-looking
statements. The following factors, among others, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K, in the
documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K or
presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. Such
factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect upon
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Because of our relationship with Microsoft,
our business could be adversely impacted by commercialization,
source code access and compatibility risks.

Our relationship with Microsoft is subject to the
following risks and uncertainties, some of which could cause a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition:

Our business could be adversely impacted by
conditions affecting the information technology
market.

The demand for our products depends substantially
upon the general demand for business-related computer hardware
and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors,
including capital spending levels, the spending levels and
growth of our current and prospective customers and general
economic conditions. Fluctuations in the demand for our products
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In 2002 and for part of
2003, adverse economic conditions decreased demand for our
products and negatively impacted our financial results. Future
economic projections



for the IT sector are uncertain. If the weakened
environment persists and slow IT spending continues, it could
continue to negatively impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Sales of products within our MetaFrame
Access Suite constitute a substantial majority of our
revenue.

We anticipate that sales of products within our
MetaFrame Access Suite and related enhancements will constitute
a substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable
future. Our ability to continue to generate revenue from our
MetaFrame product line will depend on market acceptance of
Windows Server Operating Systems and/or UNIX Operating Systems.
Declines in demand for our MetaFrame products could occur as a
result of:

If our customers do not continue to purchase our
MetaFrame products as a result of these or other factors, our
revenue would decrease and our results of operations and
financial condition would be adversely affected.

If we do not develop new products and
enhancements to our existing products, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

The markets for our products are characterized by:

Our future success depends on our ability to
continually enhance our current products and develop and
introduce new products that our customers choose to buy. If we
are unable to keep pace with technological developments and
customer demands by introducing new products and enhancements,
our business, results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely affected. Our future success could be
hindered by:

•

delays in our introduction of new products;

•

delays in market acceptance of new products or
    new releases of our current products; and

•

our, or a competitor’s, announcement of new
    product enhancements or technologies that could replace or
    shorten the life cycle of our existing product offerings.

For example, we cannot guarantee that our new
access infrastructure software will achieve the broad market
acceptance by our channel and entities with which we have a
technology relationship, customers and prospective customers
necessary to generate significant revenue. In addition, we
cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond effectively to
technological changes or new product announcements by others. If
we experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect
to our new products or new releases of our current products,
those delays or shortfalls could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



We believe that we could incur additional costs
and royalties as we develop, license or buy new technologies or
enhancements to our existing products. These added costs and
royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating
expenses. However, we cannot currently quantify the costs for
such transactions that have not yet occurred. In addition, we
may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and
investments or issue additional shares of our common stock to
fund these additional costs.

Our long sales cycle for enterprise-wide
sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and
operating results for any particular period.

In recent quarters, a growing number of our large
and medium-sized customers have decided to implement our
enterprise customer license arrangements on a department or
enterprise-wide basis. Our long sales cycle for these
large-scale deployments makes it difficult to predict when these
sales will occur, and we may not be able to sustain these sales
on a predictable basis.

We have a long sales cycle for these
enterprise-wide sales because:

The continued long sales cycle for these
large-scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict
the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could
cause significant variability in our revenue and operating
results for any particular period.

We face intense competition, which could
result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and
margins.

We compete in intensely competitive markets. Some
of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly
greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other
resources than we do.

For example, our ability to market the Citrix
MetaFrame Access Suite, and its individual products including:
Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server, Citrix MetaFrame Secure
Access Manager, Citrix MetaFrame Conferencing Manager and Citrix
MetaFrame Password Manager and other future product offerings
could be affected by Microsoft’s licensing and pricing
scheme for client devices, servers and applications. Further,
the announcement of the release, and the actual release, of new
Windows-based server operating systems or products incorporating
similar features to our products could cause our existing and
potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license
certain of our existing and future product offerings.

In addition, alternative products for secure,
remote access in the Internet software and hardware markets
directly and indirectly compete with our current products and
anticipated future product offerings. Existing or new products
that extend Internet software and hardware to provide Web-based
information and application access or interactive computing can
materially impact our ability to sell our products in this
market. Our competitors in this market include Microsoft,
Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Cisco, and other makers of secure
remote access solutions.

As the markets for our products continue to
develop, additional companies, including companies with
significant market presence in the computer hardware, software
and networking industries could enter the markets in which we
compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we
believe price competition could become a more significant
competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be
able to maintain



our historic prices and margins, which could
adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

If we determine that any of our goodwill or
intangible assets, including technology purchased in
acquisitions, are impaired, we would be required to take a
charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.

We have a significant amount of goodwill and
other intangible assets, such as product and core technology,
related to our acquisition of Sequoia Software Corporation in
2001 and Expertcity in 2004. In July 2001, we adopted SFAS No.
141,

Business Combinations,

and in January 2002, we
adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. As a result, we no longer amortize goodwill and
intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives.
However, we continue to amortize certain product and core
technologies, trademarks, patents and other intangibles. We
periodically evaluate our intangible assets, including goodwill,
for impairment. As of December 31, 2003 we had $152.4
million of goodwill. We review for impairment annually, or
sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based
on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our
management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the
risks inherent in our current business model. Due to uncertain
market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and
product portfolio, it is possible that the forecasts we use to
support our goodwill could change in the future, which could
result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

At December 31, 2003, we had $21.3 million,
net, of unamortized identified intangibles with estimable useful
lives, of which $14.9 million consists of product and core
technology we purchased in the acquisition of Sequoia and $4.5
million represents core technology purchased under third party
licenses. We have commercialized and currently market the
Sequoia and other license technology through our secure access
infrastructure software, which includes Citrix MetaFrame Secure
Access Manager and Citrix MetaFrame Password Manager. However,
our channel distributors and entities with which we have
technology relationships, customers or prospective customers may
not purchase or widely accept our new line of products. If we
fail to complete the development of our anticipated future
product offerings, if we fail to complete them in a timely
manner, or if we are unsuccessful in selling these new products,
we could determine that the value of the purchased technology is
impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to earnings. We
could also incur additional charges in later periods to reflect
costs associated with completing those projects that could not
be completed in a timely manner. If the actual revenues and
operating profit attributable to acquired product and core
technologies are less than the projections we used to initially
value product and core technologies when we acquired it, such
intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired. If we determine
that any of our intangible assets are impaired, we would be
required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Based on the preliminary allocation of the
purchase price in the first quarter of 2004 we expect to record
approximately $211 million of goodwill and intangible
assets in connection with our acquisition of Expertcity. If the
actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired
intangible assets are less than the projections we used to
initially value these intangible assets when we acquired them,
then these intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired. If we
determine that any of the goodwill or other intangible assets
associated with our acquisition of Expertcity are impaired, then
we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to
write them off completely by taking a related charge to
earnings. If we are required to write down or write off all or a
portion of those assets, or if financial analysts or investors
believe we may need to take such action in the future, our stock
price and operating results could be materially adversely
affected.

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may
not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at
the time of an acquisition.

Our growth is dependent upon market growth, our
ability to enhance existing products, and our ability to
introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue
to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing
products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines
and/or technologies.



Acquisitions, including those of high-technology
companies, are inherently risky. We cannot assure anyone that
our previous acquisitions, or any future acquisitions will be
successful in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals
either for that acquisition or for us generally. The risks we
commonly encounter are:

These factors could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We cannot guarantee that the combined company
resulting from any acquisition can continue to support the
growth achieved by the companies separately. We must also focus
on our ability to manage and integrate any acquisition. Our
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate
acquired companies could adversely affect our business and
operating results.

The anticipated benefits to us of acquiring
Expertcity may not be realized.

We acquired Expertcity with the expectation that
the acquisition would result in various benefits including,
among other things, enhanced revenue and profits, greater market
presence and development, and enhancements to our product
portfolio and customer base. We expect that the acquisition will
enhance our position in the access infrastructure market through
the combination of our technologies, products, services,
distribution channels and customer contacts with
Expertcity’s, and will enable us to broaden our customer
base to include individuals, professionals and small office/home
office customers as well as extend our presence in the
enterprise access infrastructure market. We may not realize any
of these benefits and the acquisition may result in the
deterioration or loss of significant business. For example, if
our business or Expertcity’s business fails to meet the
demands of the marketplace, customer acceptance of the products
and services of the combined companies could decline, which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. Costs incurred and potential
liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition also
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and operating results.

Achieving the expected benefits of the
acquisition will depend in part on the integration of
Expertcity’s and our businesses in a timely and efficient
manner. The challenges involved in this integration include
difficulties integrating Expertcity’s operations,
technologies and products as well as coordinating the efforts of
Expertcity’s sales organization with our larger and more
widely dispersed sales organization. The integration of the two
businesses could be complex, time consuming and expensive, may
disrupt business and may result in the loss of customers or key
employees or the diversion of the attention of management which
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and operating results.

In addition, we may not achieve the anticipated
benefits of the acquisition as rapidly as, or to the extent,
anticipated by our management and certain financial or industry
analysts, or other analysts may not perceive the same benefits
of the acquisition as we do. For example, Expertcity’s
uncertain sales and earnings stream could dilute our profits
beyond the current expectations of our management. If these
risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely
affected.



If we fail to manage our operations or fail
to continue to effectively control expenses, our future
operating results could be adversely affected.

Historically, the scope of our operations, the
number of our employees and the geographic area of our
operations have grown rapidly. In addition, we have acquired
both domestic and international companies. This growth and the
assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could
continue to place a significant strain on our managerial,
operational and financial resources. To manage our growth, if
any, effectively, we need to continue to implement and improve
additional management and financial systems and controls. We may
not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or
future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities
for our products and services in a timely and cost-effective
way. Our future operating results could also depend on our
ability to manage:

•

our expanding product line,

•

our marketing and sales organizations, and

•

our client support organization as installations
    of our products increase.

In 2004 our operating expenses will exceed our
operating expenses in 2003. An increase in operating expenses
could reduce our income from operations and cash flows from
operating activities in the future.

We could change our licensing programs,
which could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of
revenue.

We continually re-evaluate our licensing
programs, including specific license models, delivery methods,
and terms and conditions, to market our current and future
products and services. We could implement new licensing
programs, including offering specified and unspecified
enhancements to our current and future product and service
lines. Such changes could result in recognizing revenues over
the contract term as opposed to upon the initial shipment or
licensing of the software product. We could implement different
licensing models in certain circumstances, for which we would
recognize licensing fees over a longer period. Changes to our
licensing programs, including the timing of the release of
enhancements, discounts and other factors, could impact the
timing of the recognition of revenue for our products, related
enhancements and services and could adversely affect our
operating results and financial condition.

As our international sales and operations
grow, we could become increasingly subject to additional risks
that could harm our business.

We conduct significant sales and customer support
operations in countries outside of the United States. For 2003,
we derived approximately 54.6% of our revenues from sales
outside the United States. Our continued growth and
profitability could require us to further expand our
international operations. To successfully expand international
sales, we must establish additional foreign operations, hire
additional personnel and recruit additional international
resellers. Our international operations are subject to a variety
of risks, which could cause international revenues to fluctuate.
These risks include:



•

burdens of complying with a wide variety of
    foreign laws.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to
anticipate and address these risks. We cannot guarantee that
these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or
operating results. Further, as we generate cash flow in non-U.S.
jurisdictions, if required, we may experience difficulty
transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner.
In particular, a decrease in demand for software and services in
any particular region could adversely affect our future
operating results.

Our results of operations are subject to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to
minimize adverse impacts on our operating results, we generally
initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in
advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. As a result of
this policy, foreign currency denominated expenses will be
higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or
strength of the dollar in the prior year. Since the dollar was
generally weak in 2003, particularly against Euro and British
pound sterling, we currently expect that operating expenses will
be higher in 2004 but further dollar weakness in 2004 will not
have a further material impact on our operating expenses until
2005.

Our synthetic lease is an off-balance sheet
arrangement that could negatively affect our financial condition
and results.

In April 2002, we entered into a seven-year
synthetic lease with a lessor for our headquarters office
buildings in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease
qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS
No. 13,

Accounting for Leases,

so we do not include
the property or the lease debt on our consolidated balance
sheet. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

which
addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in
which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership,
contractual or other financial interests in the entity. In
December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised), which
replaced FIN No. 46. FIN No. 46 (revised) is
effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and
variable interest entities referred to as special-purpose
entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for
other types of entities for financial statements for periods
ending after March 15, 2004. We have determined that we are
not required to consolidate the lessor entity, the leased
facility or the related debt upon the adoption of FIN
No. 46, as amended. Accordingly, there was no impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows from
adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of
our property or significantly change its ownership of other
properties that it currently holds, we could be required to
consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt in a
future period.

If we elect not to purchase the property at the
end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a minimum residual
value of approximately $51.9 million to the lessor. Therefore,
if the fair value of the property declines below $51.9 million,
we would have to make up the difference under our residual value
guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. For further
information on our synthetic lease, please refer to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual
Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement” and note 10
to our consolidated financial statements.

Our proprietary rights could offer only
limited protection. Our products could infringe third-party
intellectual property rights, which could result in material
costs.

Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may
not be successful. We rely primarily on a combination of
copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to
protect our proprietary rights. The loss of any material trade
secret, trademark, trade name, patent or copyright could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Despite our
precautions, it could be possible for unauthorized third parties
to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or
to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. If we
cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized
copying or use, we may not remain competitive. Any patents owned
by us could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of
our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being
currently challenged,



may not be issued with the scope we seek, if at
all, and if issued, may not provide any meaningful protection or
competitive advantage.

In addition, our ability to protect our
proprietary rights could be affected by:

•

Differences in International Law; Enforceability
    of Licenses. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect
    our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of
    the United States and Canada. For example, we derive a
    significant portion of our sales from licensing our packaged
    products under “shrink wrap” or
    “click-to-accept” license agreements that are not
    signed by licensees and electronic enterprise customer licensing
    arrangements that are delivered electronically, all of which
    could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign
    jurisdictions in which we license our products.

•

Third Party Infringement Claims. Third parties
    have asserted infringement claims against us. As we expand our
    product lines and the number of products and competitors in our
    industry segments increase and the functionality of these
    products overlap, we could become increasingly subject to
    infringement claims and claims to the unauthorized use of a
    third-party’s code in our products. Companies and inventors
    are more frequently seeking to patent software and business
    methods because of developments in the law that could extend the
    ability to obtain such patents. As a result, we could receive
    more patent infringement claims. Responding to any infringement
    claim, regardless of its validity, could result in costly
    litigation; injunctive relief or require us to obtain a license
    to intellectual property rights of those third parties. Licenses
    may not be available on reasonable terms, on terms compatible
    with the protection of our proprietary rights, or at all. In
    addition, attention to these claims could divert our
    management’s time and attention from developing our
    business. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail
    to develop or license a substitute technology, our business,
    results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could
    be materially adversely affected.

We are subject to risks associated with our
technology relationships.

Our business depends on technology relationships.
We cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in
the future. In addition to our relationship with Microsoft, we
rely on technology relationships with such companies as IBM, HP,
Dell and others. We depend on the entities with which we have
technology relationships to successfully test our products, to
incorporate our technology into their products and to market and
sell those products. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to maintain our current technology relationships or to develop
additional technology relationships. If any entities in which we
have a technology relationship are unable to incorporate our
technology into their products or to market or sell those
products, our business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

If we lose access to third party licenses,
releases of our products could be delayed.

We believe that we will continue to rely, in
part, on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our
products. Third party licensing arrangements are subject to a
number of risks and uncertainties, including:

If we lose or are unable to maintain any of these
third party licenses or are required to modify software obtained
under third party licenses, it could delay the release of our
products. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our success depends on our ability to
attract and retain large enterprise customers.

We must retain and continue to expand our ability
to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding
effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting
services. Our inability to attract and retain



large enterprise customers could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Large enterprise customers usually request
special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles, which
could negatively impact our revenues. By granting special
pricing, such as bundled pricing or discounts, to these large
customers, we may have to defer recognition of some portion of
the revenue from such sales. This deferral could reduce our
revenues and operating profits for a given reporting period.
Additionally, as we attempt to attract and penetrate large
enterprise customers, we may need to increase corporate branding
and marketing activities, which could increase our operating
expenses. These efforts may not proportionally increase our
operating revenues and could reduce our profits.

Our business could be adversely affected if
we are unable to expand and diversify our distribution
channels.

We currently intend to continue to expand our
distribution channels by leveraging our relationships with
independent hardware and software vendors and system integrators
to encourage them to recommend or distribute our products. In
addition, an integral part of our strategy is to diversify our
base of channel relationships by adding more channel members
with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers. This will
require additional resources, as we will need to expand our
internal sales and service coverage of these customers. If we
fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our
distribution channels, our business could be adversely affected.
In addition to this diversification of our base, we will need to
maintain a healthy mix of members who cater to smaller
customers. We may need to add and remove distribution members to
maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of our
products, which could increase our operating expenses. Through
our accessPARTNER network, Citrix Authorized Learning Centers
and other programs, we are currently investing, and intend to
continue to invest, significant resources to develop these
channels, which could reduce our profits.

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow
from operations in the future, we may not be able to fund our
operations and fulfill our future obligations.

Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations to fund our operations and product development,
including the payment of cash consideration in acquisitions, the
redemption of our debentures in the first quarter of 2004 and
the payment of our other obligations, depends on a range of
economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are
outside our control. Specifically, the redemption of our
outstanding debentures in the first quarter of 2004 will require
us to expend approximately $355.7 million and will significantly
deplete our existing cash and investments. We cannot assure you
that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from
operations, or that we will be able to liquidate our
investments, repatriate cash and investments held in our
overseas subsidiaries, sell assets or raise equity or debt
financings when needed or desirable. An inability to fund our
operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. For further information, please refer to
“–Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

We rely on indirect distribution channels
and major distributors that we do not control.

We rely significantly on independent distributors
and resellers to market and distribute our products. We do not
control our distributors and resellers. Additionally, our
distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products
and could also represent other lines of products. Some of our
distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged
products for resale to smaller end-users. If distributors and
resellers reduce their inventory of our packaged products, our
business could be adversely affected. During 2003 we believe
that our distributors and resellers held smaller inventories of
packaged products as compared to inventories they held in prior
years. Further, we could maintain individually significant
accounts receivable balances with certain distributors. The
financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and
distributors could significantly delay or default on their
payment obligations. Any significant delays or defaults could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.



Our products could contain errors that
could delay the release of new products and may not be detected
until after our products are shipped.

Despite significant testing by us and by current
and potential customers, our products, especially new products
or releases, could contain errors. In some cases, these errors
may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been
made. Errors in our products could delay the development or
release of new products and could adversely affect market
acceptance of our products. Additionally, our products depend on
third party products, which could contain defects and could
reduce the performance of our products or render them useless.
Because our products are often used in mission-critical
applications, errors in our products or the products of third
parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty
or other claims by our customers.

If we lose key personnel or cannot hire
enough qualified employees, our ability to manage our business
could be adversely affected.

Our success depends, in large part, upon the
services of a number of key employees. Except for certain key
employees of acquired businesses, we do not have long-term
employment agreements with any of our key personnel. Any officer
or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any
time. The effective management of our growth, if any, could
depend upon our ability to retain our highly skilled technical,
managerial, finance and marketing personnel. If any of those
employees leave, we will need to attract and retain replacements
for them. We also need to add key personnel in the future. The
market for these qualified employees is competitive. We could
find it difficult to successfully attract, assimilate or retain
sufficiently qualified personnel in sufficient numbers.
Furthermore, we may hire key personnel in connection with our
future acquisitions, however, any of these employees will be
able to terminate his or her relationship with us at any time.
If we cannot retain and add the necessary staff and resources
for these acquired businesses, our ability to develop acquired
products, markets and customers could be adversely affected.
Also, we may need to hire additional personnel to develop new
products, product enhancements and technologies. If we cannot
add the necessary staff and resources, our ability to develop
future enhancements and features to our existing or future
products could be delayed. Any delays could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

If stock balancing returns or price
adjustments exceed our reserves, our operating results could be
adversely affected.

We provide most of our distributors with stock
balancing return rights, which generally permit our distributors
to return products to us, subject to ordering an equal dollar
amount of our products. We also provide price protection rights
to most of our distributors. Price protection rights require
that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of
our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for
those products within a specified time period. To cover our
exposure to these product returns and price adjustments, we
establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product
trends and current marketing plans. However, we cannot assure
you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover our future
product returns and price adjustments. If we inadequately
forecast reserves, our operating results could be adversely
affected.

Our stock price could be volatile, and you
could lose the value of your investment.

Our stock price has been volatile and has
fluctuated significantly to date. The trading price of our stock
is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide
fluctuations. Your investment in our stock could lose value.
Some of the factors that could significantly affect the market
price of our stock include:



The stock market in general, The Nasdaq National
Market and the market for software companies and technology
companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations. These broad market and industry factors
could materially and adversely affect the market price of our
stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

Our business and investments could be
adversely impacted by unfavorable economic
conditions.

General economic and market conditions, and other
factors outside our control, could adversely affect our business
and impair the value of our investments. Any further downturn in
general economic conditions could result in a reduction in
demand for our products and services and could harm our
business. In addition, an economic downturn could result in an
impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to
record losses related to such investments. Impairment in the
value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and
distract management. As of December 31, 2003, we had $538.9
million of short and long-term investments with various issuers
and financial institutions. In many cases we do not attempt to
reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and
could incur losses related to the impairment of these
investments. Fluctuations in economic and market conditions
could adversely affect the value of our investments, and we
could lose some of our investment portfolio. A total loss of an
investment could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. For further information on these
investments, please refer to “–Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

Our revenue may not grow, and if we do not
continue to successfully manage our expenses, our business could
be negatively impacted.

We attribute most of our growth during recent
years to the introduction of the MetaFrame software for Windows
operating systems in mid-1998. We cannot assure you that the
access infrastructure software markets, in which we operate,
will grow. We cannot assure you that the release of our access
infrastructure software suite of products or other new products
will increase our revenue growth rate.

In addition, to the extent our revenue grows, if
at all, we believe that our cost of revenues and certain
operating expenses could also increase. We cannot assure you
that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or
actual revenues in any given quarter. If we experience a
shortfall in revenue in any given quarter, we likely will not be
able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response.
Any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and
adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter.
Also, due to the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our
current expectation for revenue growth, our income from
operations and cash flows from operating and investing
activities could be lower than in recent years.

Political and social turmoil could
adversely impact our business.

Political and social turmoil, including terrorist
and military actions, can be expected to put further pressure on
economic conditions in the United States and foreign
jurisdictions. These conditions make it difficult for us, and
our customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business
activities and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The market for our Web-based training and
customer assistance products is volatile, and if it does not
develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our Online
Division will be harmed.

The market for our Web-based training and
customer assistance products is new and unproven, and it is
uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high
levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success with our
Online Division will depend to a substantial extent on the
willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their
use of application services in general and for GoToMyPC and
GoToAssist, in particular. Many enterprises have invested
substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate
traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and
therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to
application services. Furthermore, some enterprises may be
reluctant or unwilling to use application services because they
have concerns regarding the risks associated with security
capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery
model associated with these services. If enterprises do not
perceive the benefits of application services,



then the market for these services may not
further develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we
expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our
financial condition and the operating results for our Online
Division.

If our security measures are breached and
unauthorized access is obtained to our Online Division
customers’ data, our services may be perceived as not being
secure and these customers may curtail or stop using our
service.

Use of our GoToMyPC or GoToAssist services
involves the storage and transmission of customers’
proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us
to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible
liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of
third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise,
and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of
our Online customers’ data, our reputation will be damaged,
our business may suffer and we could incur significant
liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access
or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not
recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate
preventative measures. If any compromises of security were to
occur, it could have the effect of substantially reducing the
use of the Web for commerce and communications. Anyone who
circumvents our security measures could misappropriate
proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services
or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is
sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer
viruses, software programs that disable or impair computers,
have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet.
Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those
of our customers or suppliers, which could disrupt our network
or make it inaccessible to our Online Division customers. If an
actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market
perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could
be harmed and we could lose sales and customers for our Online
Division, which would significantly adversely affect our
financial condition and the operating results for our Online
Division.

Evolving regulation of the Web may
adversely affect our Online Division.

As Web commerce continues to evolve, increasing
regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more
likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely
in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying
to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal
or consumer information could affect our Online customers’
ability to use and share data and restricting our ability to
store, process and share data with these customers. In addition,
taxation of services provided over the Web or other charges
imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for
accessing the Web may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing
greater fees for Web use or restricting information exchange
over the Web could result in a decline in the use of the Web and
the viability of Web-based services, which would significantly
adversely affect our financial condition and the operating
results for our Online Division.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The following discussion about our market risk
includes “forward-looking statements” that involve
risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The
analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed
below should not be considered projections of future events,
gains or losses.

We are exposed to financial market risks,
including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates that could adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition. To mitigate foreign currency
and interest rate risk, we utilize derivative financial
instruments. The counter-parties to our derivative instruments
are major financial institutions. All of the potential changes
noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our
financial position as of December 31, 2003. Actual results
could differ materially.

Discussions of our accounting policies for
derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes 2 and
13 to our consolidated financial statements.

Exposure to Exchange Rates

A substantial majority of our overseas expense
and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local
currencies, primarily British pounds sterling, Euros, Swiss
francs, Japanese yen and Australian dollars. To reduce exposure
to reduction in U.S. dollar value and the volatility of future
cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have
established a hedging program. We use foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
expenditures. Our hedging program significantly reduces, but
does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange
rate movements.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had in
place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional
amount of $37.2 million and $48.9 million, respectively, and
foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional
amount of $160.9 million and $128.4 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, these contracts had an
aggregate fair value of $7.9 million and $3.6 million,
respectively. Based on a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the
U.S. dollar from December 31, 2003 market rates the fair
value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease
by $13.1 million. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% depreciation of
the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2003 market rates would
increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward
contracts by $13.1 million. Foreign operating costs in these
hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction.
This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to
the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified
above, changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar
value of sales and affect the volume of sales as
competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our
sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in
levels of local currency prices or sales reported in U.S.
dollars. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows as a result of these forward foreign exchange contracts.

Exposure to Interest Rates

We have interest rate exposures resulting from
our interest-based available-for-sale securities. In order to
better manage our exposure to interest rate risk, we are a party
to 19 interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements, with
an aggregate notional amount of $182.4 million convert the fixed
rate return on certain of our available-for-sale securities, to
a floating rate. The aggregate fair value of the interest rate
swaps at December 31, 2003 was a liability of $2.0 million.
Based upon a hypothetical 1% increase in the market interest
rate as of December 31, 2003, the fair value of these
aggregated liabilities would have decreased by approximately
$5.0 million. Based on a hypothetical 1% decrease in the market
interest rate as of December 31, 2003, the fair value of these
aggregated liabilities would have increased by approximately
$6.9 million. The underlying assets would experience offsetting
gains and losses. We also maintain available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity investments in debt securities, which limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer, or type
of instrument. The securities in our investment portfolio are
not leveraged. The securities classified as available-for-sale
are subject to interest rate risk. The modeling technique used
measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate
hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that
ending fair values



include principal plus accrued interest,
dividends and reinvestment income. If market interest rates were
to increase by 100 basis points from December 31, 2003 and
2002 levels, the fair value of the available-for-sale portfolio
would decline by approximately $0.6 million. This sensitivity
analysis on our available-for-sale portfolio excludes the
underlying investments to our 19 interest rate swaps discussed
above, as the interest rate risk related to those investments
has been effectively hedged. For more information see note 13 to
our consolidated financial statements.

These amounts are determined by considering the
impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our interest rate
swap agreements and available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
investment portfolios. This analysis does not consider the
effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of
overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.

In April 2002, we entered into a synthetic lease
with a substantive lessor totaling approximately $61 million
related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters.
Payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable
interest rate (LIBOR plus a margin). Based upon our interest
rate exposure under this synthetic lease at December 31,
2003, a 100 basis point change in the current interest rate
would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and
results of operations. In addition to interest rate exposure, if
the fair value of our headquarters building in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida were to significantly decline, there could be a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
    ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

There have been no changes in or disagreements
with accountants on accounting or financial disclosure matters
during the Company’s two most recent fiscal years.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2003, the Company’s
management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and the Company’s Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based
upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and the Company’s Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2003, the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and the Company’s Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. During the period
covered by this report, there have been no changes in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Citrix Systems, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Citrix Systems, Inc. as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Citrix Systems, Inc. at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
certain intangible assets as a result of adopting Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 142,

Goodwill and

CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

1.  ORGANIZATION

Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix” or the
“Company”), a Delaware corporation founded on
April 17, 1989, is a leading supplier of access
infrastructure software and services that enable the effective
and efficient enterprise-wide deployment, management and access
of applications and information, including those designed for
Microsoft® Windows® operating systems, for UNIX®
operating systems, such as Sun Solaris™, HP-UX, or
IBM®-AIX® and for Web-based information systems, as
well as Web-based desktop access. The Company’s
MetaFrame® products permit organizations to provide secure
access to Windows based, Web-based and UNIX applications
regardless of the user’s location, network connection or
type of client hardware platforms. The Company markets and
licenses its software products primarily through multiple
channels such as value-added resellers, channel distributors,
system integrators and independent software vendors, managed by
the Company’s worldwide sales force. The Company also
promotes its products through relationships with a wide variety
of industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Consolidation Policy

The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in
the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa
(“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific. All significant
transactions and balances between the Company and its
subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents at December 31,
2003 include marketable securities, which are primarily
municipal securities, corporate securities, government
securities and money market funds with initial or remaining
contractual maturities when purchased of three months or less.
The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash and
cash equivalents by investing primarily in investment grade,
highly liquid instruments and periodically evaluating the credit
quality of its primary financial institutions.

Investments

Short and long-term investments at
December 31, 2003 primarily consist of corporate
securities, government securities, commercial paper and
municipal securities. Investments classified as
available-for-sale are stated at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). Investments classified as
held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost. The Company does
not recognize changes in the fair value of investments in income
unless a decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.

The Company minimizes its credit risk associated
with investments by investing primarily in investment grade,
highly liquid securities. The Company maintains investments with
various financial institutions and the Company’s policy is
designed to limit exposure to any one institution depending on
credit quality. Periodic evaluations of the relative credit
standing of those financial institutions are considered in the
Company’s investment strategy. The Company uses information
provided by third parties to adjust the carrying value of
certain of its investments and derivative instruments to fair
value at the end of each period. Fair values are based on
valuation models that use market quotes and, for certain
investments, assumptions as to the creditworthiness of the
entities issuing those underlying investments.

At December 31, 2003, approximately $63
million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for
specified obligations under the Company’s synthetic lease.
In addition, at December 31, 2003, approximately $83.6
million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for
certain of the Company’s credit default contracts. The
Company maintains the ability to manage the composition of the
pledged investments and

investment earnings are available for operating
purposes. Accordingly, these securities are not reflected as
restricted investments in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. For further information, see Notes 10 and 13.

Accounts Receivable

Substantially all of the Company’s accounts
receivable are due from value-added resellers and distributors
of computer software. Collateral is not required. Credit losses
and expected product returns are provided for in the
consolidated financial statements and have been within
management’s expectations. If the financial condition of a
significant distributor or customer were to deteriorate, the
Company’s operating results could be adversely affected. No
distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of gross
accounts receivable at December 31, 2003 or 2002.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three
years for computer equipment, software, office equipment and
furniture, the lesser of the lease term or five years for
leasehold improvements, seven years for the enterprise resource
planning system and 40 years for buildings. Assets under capital
leases are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the
remaining lease term. Amortization of assets under capital
leases is included in depreciation expense. Accumulated
amortization of equipment under capital leases approximated $0.4
million at December 31, 2002. There were no assets under
capital leases at December 31, 2003.

During 2003, the Company retired $15.4 million in
property and equipment that were no longer in use. At the time
of retirement, these assets had no remaining net book value and
no asset retirement obligations associated with them.

Property and equipment consist of the following:

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and
used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment
loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its
carrying value. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

F-8


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2003, the Company did not recognize any
impairment charges associated with its long-lived or intangible
assets. During 2002, the Company recognized $2.0 million in
asset impairment charges primarily due to the consolidation of
certain of its offices resulting in the abandonment of certain
leasehold improvements. These charges are reflected in operating
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
and primarily related to the Americas geographic segment. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company determined that there were
no triggering events requiring additional impairment analysis.

Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use

The Company accounts for internal use software
pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use

. Pursuant to the SOP, the Company
capitalizes external direct costs of materials and services used
in the project and internal costs such as payroll and benefits
of those employees directly associated with the development of
the software. The amount of costs capitalized in 2003 and 2002
relating to internal use software were $3.8 million and $3.4
million, respectively, consisting principally of purchased
software and services provided by external vendors. These costs
are being amortized over the estimated useful life of the
software developed, which is generally three to seven years and
are included in property and equipment in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill

The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 142, requires that goodwill
and certain intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject
to an annual impairment test. At December 31, 2003 and
2002, the Company had $152.4 million of goodwill. There was no
impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment
tests completed during the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002.
Excluding goodwill, the Company has no intangible assets deemed
to have indefinite lives. Substantially all of the
Company’s goodwill at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was
associated with the Americas reportable segment. See Note 12 for
segment information.

The following table provides a reconciliation of
reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 to
net income adjusted as if SFAS No. 142 had been applied as
of the beginning of 2001 (in thousands except per share amounts).

Intangible Assets

The Company has intangible assets with definite
lives that are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization.
Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets, generally three to five years, except for
patents, which are amortized over 10 years. In accordance
with SFAS No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,

the
Company records acquired core and product technology at net
realizable value and reviews this technology for impairment on a
periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value
to the unamortized cost of the technology. There has been no
impairment of these assets to date. On February 27, 2004, the
Company acquired Expertcity.com, Inc. (“Expertcity”).
The expected increases to our goodwill, intangible assets and
estimated amortization are not reflected in the tables below.
For further information regarding the acquisition and the
preliminary purchase price allocation, see Note 17.

Intangible assets consist of the following (in
thousands):

Estimated future annual amortization expense is
as follows (in thousands):

Software Development Costs

SFAS No. 86 requires certain software
development costs to be capitalized upon the establishment of
technological feasibility. The establishment of technological
feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of
these costs requires considerable judgment by management with
respect to certain external factors such as anticipated future
revenue, estimated economic life, and changes in software and
hardware technologies. Software development costs incurred
beyond the establishment of technological feasibility have not
been significant.

Revenue Recognition

The Company markets and licenses software
products primarily through value-added resellers, channel
distributors, system integrators and independent software
vendors, managed by the Company’s worldwide sales force.
The Company also separately sells software license updates and
technical services, which includes product training, technical
support and consulting services. The Company’s software
licenses are generally perpetual, and are delivered by means of
traditional packaged products and electronically.

The Company’s packaged products are
typically purchased by medium and small-sized businesses with a
minimal number of locations. In these cases, the software
license is delivered with the packaged product. Electronic
license arrangements are used with more complex multi-server
environments typically found in larger business enterprises that
deploy the Company’s products on a department or
enterprise-wide basis, which could require differences in
product features and functionality at various customer
locations. Once the

F-10


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company receives a purchase order, the enterprise
customer licenses are electronically delivered to the customer
with “software activation keys” that enable the
feature configuration ordered by the end-user. Software may be
delivered indirectly by a channel distributor or directly by the
Company pursuant to a purchase order.

Revenue is recognized when it is earned. The
Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance
with SOP 97-2 (as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9) and related
interpretations,

Software Revenue Recognition

. The
Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria
are met: persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists; delivery
has occurred and the Company has no remaining obligations; the
fee is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is probable.
The Company defines these four criteria as follows:

Net revenues include the following categories:
Software Licenses, Software License Updates, Services, and
Other. Software Licenses primarily represents fees related to
the licensing of the MetaFrame products, additional user
licenses and management products (such as load balancing and
resource management

F-11


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

products). These revenues are reflected net of
sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return
rights. Software License Updates consists of fees related to the
Subscription Advantage program (the Company’s terminology
for PCS) that are recognized ratably over the term of the
contract, which is typically 12-24 months. Subscription
Advantage is an annual renewable program that provides
subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades,
enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become
available during the term of subscription. Services consist
primarily of technical support services revenue recognized
ratably over the contract term, revenue from product training
and certification, and consulting services revenue related to
implementation of the Company’s software products, which is
recognized as the services are provided. In May 1997, the
Company entered into a five-year joint license, development and
marketing agreement with the Microsoft Corporation, which
expired in May 2002. Other represents the royalty fees
recognized in connection with the Microsoft Development
Agreement.

The Company sells most of its software products
bundled with an initial subscription for software license
updates that provides the end-user with free enhancements and
upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available
basis. Customers may also elect to purchase technical support,
product training or consulting services. The Company allocates
revenue to software license updates and any other undelivered
elements of the arrangement based on VSOE of fair value of each
element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable
delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria
described above have been met. The balance of the revenue, net
of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is allocated to
the delivered software product using the residual method and
recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the software
licenses are delivered. If management cannot objectively
determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on
VSOE, revenue recognition is deferred until all elements are
delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value
can be objectively determined.

In the normal course of business, the Company
does not permit product returns, but it does provide most of its
distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and
price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit
distributors to return products to the Company, subject to
ordering an equal dollar amount of other products. Price
protection rights require that the Company grant retroactive
price adjustments for inventories of products held by
distributors or resellers if it lowers prices for such products.
The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns for
stock balancing and price protection rights, as well as other
sales allowances, concurrently with the recognition of revenue.
The provisions are established based upon consideration of a
variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and
historical return rates for both specific products and
distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by product,
the impact of any new product releases and projected economic
conditions. Actual product returns for stock balancing and price
protection provisions incurred are, however, dependent upon
future events, including the amount of stock balancing activity
by distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the
time of any price adjustments. The Company continually monitors
the factors that influence the pricing of its products and
distributor inventory levels and makes adjustments to these
provisions when it believes actual returns and other allowances
could differ from established reserves. The Company’s
ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to distributors is
predicated on its ability to reliably estimate future stock
balancing returns. If actual experience or changes in market
condition impairs the Company’s ability to estimate
returns, it would be required to defer the recognition of
revenue until the delivery of the product to the end-user.
Allowances for estimated product returns amounted to
approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2003 and $10.5
million at December 31, 2002. The Company has not reduced and
has no current plans to reduce its prices for inventory
currently held by distributors or resellers. Accordingly, there
were no reserves required for price protection at
December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. The Company
records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
and incentive offerings including volume-based incentives. If
market conditions were to decline, the Company could take
actions to increase its customer incentive offerings, which
could result in an incremental reduction to revenue at the time
the incentive is offered.

F-12


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company provides consulting services to
certain license customers. The services consist of network
configuration and optimization and are typically performed prior
to the customers’ purchase and implementation of the
Company’s software products. Services are not essential to
the functionality of the Company’s software and do not
constitute modifications to the Company’s software. The
costs for providing consulting services are included in cost of
sales. The costs of providing training and services are included
in sales, marketing and support expenses.

Product Concentration

The Company derives a substantial portion of its
revenues from one software product and anticipates that this
product and future derivative products and product lines based
upon this technology, if any, will constitute a majority of its
revenue for the foreseeable future. The Company could experience
declines in demand for products, whether as a result of general
economic conditions, new competitive product releases, price
competition, lack of success of its strategic partners,
technological change or other factors.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues consist primarily of
compensation and other personnel-related costs of providing
consulting services, as well as, the cost of royalties, product
media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials and shipping
expense. The Company is a party to licensing agreements with
various entities, which give the Company the right to use
certain software code in its products or in the development of
future products in exchange for the payment of a fixed fee or
certain amounts based upon the sales of the related product. The
licensing agreements generally have terms ranging from one to
five years, and generally include renewal options. However, some
agreements may be perpetual unless expressly terminated.
Royalties and other costs related to these agreements are
included in cost of revenues. The Company’s cost of
revenues excludes amortization of acquired core and product
technologies, which is included in amortization of intangible
assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of each of the
Company’s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S.
dollar. Assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are
remeasured into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are remeasured at average rates prevailing
during the year. Remeasurement and foreign currency transaction
gains (losses) of approximately $2.4 million, $(1.1)
million and $(2.4) million for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, are included in other income
(expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

In accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

and its related interpretations and amendments, the Company
records derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. For
derivatives that are designated as and qualify as effective cash
flow hedges, the portion of gain or loss on the derivative
instrument effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item is
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) and reclassified into earnings as operating
income (expense) when the hedged transaction affects
earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated as and
qualify as effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in
current earnings as interest income (expense) during the
period of the change in fair values. Derivatives not designated
as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through
earnings as other income (expense) in the period the
changes in fair value occur. The application of the provisions
of SFAS No. 133 could impact the volatility of earnings.

F-13


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company formally documents all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions. This process includes attributing all
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to floating
rate assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and
attributing all derivatives that are designated as fair value
hedges to fixed rate assets or liabilities. The Company also
formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an
ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged
item. Fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments
are generally offset by changes in the hedged item; however, if
it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge,
the Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for
the affected derivative.

Advertising Expense

The Company expenses advertising costs as
incurred. The Company has cooperative advertising agreements
with certain distributors and resellers whereby the Company will
reimburse distributors and resellers for qualified advertising
of Citrix products. Reimbursement is made once the distributor
or reseller provides substantiation of qualified expenditures.
The Company estimates the impact of this program and recognizes
it at the time of product sale as a component of sales,
marketing and support expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. The Company recognized advertising
expenses of approximately $13.5 million, $10.0 million and $11.1
million, during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company estimates income taxes based on rates
in effect in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based
upon differences between the financial statement and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The realization of deferred tax assets is based on
historical tax positions and expectations about future taxable
income. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred
tax assets based on the “not more likely than not”
criteria of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant
estimates made by management include the provision for doubtful
accounts receivables, provision for estimated returns for stock
balancing and price protection rights, as well as other sales
allowances, the valuation of the Company’s goodwill, net
realizable value of core and product technology, the provision
for income taxes and the amortization and depreciation periods
for intangible and long-lived assets. While the Company believes
that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with
the consolidated financial position and results of operations
taken as a whole, the actual amounts of such estimates, when
known, will vary from these estimates.

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,

as amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation,

defines a fair value method of
accounting for issuance of stock options and other equity
instruments. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is
measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award
and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the
vesting period. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, companies are not
required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for
employee stock-based transactions. Companies are permitted to
account for such transactions under

Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,

but are required to disclose in a note to the
consolidated financial statements pro forma net income and per
share amounts as if a company had applied the fair methods
prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for its plans, stock
options granted to employees and non-employee directors and has
complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123.
Except for non-employee directors, the Company has not granted
any options to non-employees. The Company has elected to follow
APB Opinion No. 25 because the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of
option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, that
were developed for use with traded options which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable, as opposed to employee
stock options, which are typically non-transferable and last up
to ten years. Currently, management believes there is not one
agreed upon option valuation method that is comparable among all
reporting companies. Specifically, the Black-Scholes model
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
assumptions related to the expected stock price volatility over
the expected life of the option. Because the Company’s
stock-based awards to employees have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion,
the existing pricing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock-based
awards to employees. Since the Black-Scholes model is based on
statistical expectations, the calculation can result in
substantial earnings volatility that may not agree, as to timing
or amount, with the actual gain or loss accrued or realized by
the option holder.

No stock-based employee compensation cost is
reflected in net income, as all options granted under the
Company’s plans had an exercise price equal to or above
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
grant. Had compensation cost for the Company’s four
stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for grants under those plans consistent
with the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company’s cash
flows would have remained unchanged, however net income and
earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

F-15


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For purposes of the pro forma calculations, the
fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, assuming no
expected dividends and the following assumptions:

Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a
stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected life of
the option. Much of the value of a stock option is derived from
its potential for appreciation. This potential is reflected in
the volatility of the underlying stock, which can be measured by
periodic changes in the historical stock price. The higher the
volatility, the higher the fair value of the option.

The risk-free interest rate represents the
current rate associated with zero coupon U.S. Government
securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life of
the options being valued. The risk-free interest rate is used in
determining the stock’s forward value, and only modestly
impacts the fair value of the option. The higher the risk-free
interest rate, the higher the fair value of the option.

The expected life of the option is a measure of
the amount of time it is expected to take for an employee to
exercise their option. Estimating expected lives involves
consideration of several factors, including the characteristics
of employees receiving the option awards, the vesting period of
the awards, historical exercise patterns of employees, and the
expected volatility of the underlying stock. The longer the
expected life, the more time the option holder has available to
allow the stock price to increase, and thus the higher the
option’s fair value.

The determination of the fair value of all
options is based on the assumptions described in the preceding
paragraphs, and because additional option grants are expected to
be made each year and forfeitures will occur when employees
leave the Company, the above pro forma disclosures are not
representative of pro forma effects on reported net income
(loss) for future years. See Note 6 for more information
regarding the Company’s stock option plans.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by
dividing income available to shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each
period. Diluted earnings per share includes the potential impact
of convertible securities and dilutive common share equivalents.
Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable
upon the exercise of certain stock options (calculated using the
treasury stock method) and put warrants (calculated using the
reverse treasury stock method). The reconciliation of the
numerator and denominator of the earnings per share calculation
is presented in Note 14.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of the prior
years’ financial statements have been made to conform to
the current year’s presentation.

3.  ACQUISITIONS

In April 2001, the Company completed the
acquisition of Sequoia Software Corporation
(“Sequoia”) for approximately $182.6 million. A
portion of the purchase price was allocated to in-process
research and development (“IPR&D”), which the
Company concluded had not reached technological feasibility and
for which there was no alternative future use after taking into
consideration the potential use of technologies in different
products, the stage of development and life cycle of each
project, resale of the software and internal

F-16

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

use. The value of the respective purchased
IPR&D was expensed at the time of the transaction and
resulted in a pre-tax charge to the Company’s operations of
approximately $2.6 million in 2001.

In February 2000, the Company acquired all of the
operating assets of the Innovex Group, Inc.
(“Innovex”) for approximately $47.8 million. At the
date of acquisition, the Company paid approximately $28.7
million in consideration and $0.2 million in transaction costs,
respectively. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the
remaining purchase consideration, plus interest, was
contingently payable based on future events. During 2001, these
contingencies were met, resulting in approximately $16.2 million
of additional purchase price and $2.9 million in compensation
paid to the former owners. Pursuant to the acquisition
agreement, payment of $10.5 million of the contingent amounts
and associated interest was made in August 2001 and $10.7
million was paid in 2002. There are no remaining contingent
obligations.

Each acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. The consolidated financial
statements reflect the operations of the acquired businesses for
the periods after their respective dates of acquisition. The
purchase consideration was allocated to the acquired assets and
liabilities based on fair values as follows:

4.  CASH AND INVESTMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents and investments
consists of the following:

F-17


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has two AAA-rated zero coupon
corporate securities classified as held-to-maturity investments
that are carried at the combined accreted value of approximately
$192.5 million and $180.4 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. These securities mature on March 22,
2004. The Company does not recognize changes in fair value of
the held-to-maturity investment unless a decline in the fair
value is other-than-temporary, in which case the Company would
recognize a loss in earnings. There have been no losses
associated with the corporate securities to date. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of the
securities were $194.5 million and $180.2 million, respectively

The Company’s other short and long-term
investments are classified as available-for-sale and are
recorded at fair value. Gross realized gains on sales of
securities and other-than-temporary write downs of investments
classified as available-for-sale, using the specific
identification method, were $2.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Gross realized gains and losses were
$0.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Gross realized losses on sales of
securities during 2003 were not material. At December 31,
2003, the average original contractual maturity of the
Company’s short-term available-for-sale investments was
approximately 14 months. The Company’s long-term
available-for-sale investments at December 31, 2003 include
$267.2 million of investments with original contractual
maturities ranging from one to five years and $18.0 million of
investments with original contractual maturities ranging from
five to 10 years. The average remaining maturities of the
Company’s short and long-term available-for-sale
investments at December 31, 2003 was five and
33 months, respectively. The Company also owns $0.3 million
in equity investments not due at a single maturity date
classified as long-term investments.

The Company has investments in two instruments
with an aggregate amount of $38 million that include structured
credit risk features related to certain referenced entities. To
date there have been no credit events resulting in losses to the
Company for the underlying referenced entities. The Company
separately accounts for changes in the fair value of the
structured credit features of the investments and as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, there was no material change in
fair value. In the event that there are future credit events
that accrue to the Company, the Company’s investment will
be reduced to fund the loss, not to exceed the principal value
of the investment.

The change in net unrealized securities gains
(losses) recognized in other comprehensive income includes
unrealized gains (losses) that arose from changes in market
value of securities that were held during the period and gains
(losses) that were previously unrealized, but have been
recognized in current period net income due to sales of
available-for-sale securities. This reclassification has no
effect on total comprehensive income or stockholders’
equity and was immaterial for all periods presented. The
unrealized gain (loss) associated with each individual
category of cash and investments was not significant for either
of the periods presented.

EXPENSES

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of

6.  EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND
BENEFIT PLANS

Stock Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2003, the Company has
four stock-based compensation plans, which are described below.
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to
employees with an exercise price equal to or above the market
value of the shares at the date of grant. As mentioned in Note
2, the Company applies the intrinsic value method under APB
Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting
for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for its fixed stock plans and its stock purchase
plan. However, the impact on the Company’s financial
statements from the use of options is reflected in the
calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution (see
Note 14).

Fixed Stock Option Plans

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1995
Stock Plan (the “1995 Plan”) was originally adopted by
the Board on September 28, 1995 and approved by the
Company’s stockholders in October 1995. Under the terms of
the 1995 Plan, the Company is authorized to grant incentive
stock options (“ISOs”) and non-qualified stock options
(“NSOs”), make stock awards and provide the
opportunity to purchase stock to employees, directors and
officers and consultants of the Company. The 1995 Plan, as
amended, provides for the issuance of a maximum of 69,945,623
(as adjusted for stock splits) shares of Common Stock, plus,
effective January 1, 2001 and each year thereafter, a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to 5% of the total number
of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
December 31 of the preceding year. Under the 1995 Plan, a
maximum of 60,000,000 ISOs may be granted and ISOs must be
granted at exercise prices no less than fair market value at the
date of grant, except for ISOs granted to employees who own more
than 10% of the Company’s combined voting power, for which
the exercise prices will be no less than 110% of the market
value at the date of grant. NSOs, stock awards or stock
purchases may be granted or authorized, as applicable, at prices
no less than the minimum legal consideration required. Under the
1995 Plan, as amended, ISOs must be granted at exercise prices
no less than market value at the date of grant; provided,
however, that if an NSO is expressly granted in lieu of a
reasonable amount of salary or cash bonus, the exercise price
may be equal to or greater than 85% of the fair market value at
the date of such grant. ISOs and NSOs expire ten years from the
date of grant. All options are exercisable upon vesting. The
options typically vest over four years at a rate of 25% of the
shares underlying the option one year from the date of grant and
at a rate of 2.08% monthly thereafter.

The Company’s Second Amended and Restated
2000 Director and Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the
“2000 Plan”) was originally adopted by the Board of
Directors and approved by the Company’s stockholders on
May 18, 2000. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, the Company
is authorized to make stock awards, provide eligible individuals
with the opportunity to purchase stock, grant ISOs and grant
NSOs to officers and directors of the Company. The 2000 Plan
provides for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares, plus,
effective on January 1, 2001, on January 1 of each year, a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to one-half of one
percent (0.5%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of December 31 of the preceding
year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of stock
options that may be issued pursuant to the 2000 Plan shall be
equal to the maximum number of stock options issuable under the
2000 Plan at any time less 500,000 stock options, and no more
than 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued pursuant to
the exercise of incentive stock options granted under the 2000
Plan. Under the 2000 Plan, ISOs must be granted at exercise
prices no less than market value at the date of grant, provided
however, that if an NSO is expressly granted in lieu of a
reasonable amount of salary or cash bonus, the exercise price
may be equal to or greater than 85% of the fair market value at
the date of such grant. ISOs and NSOs expire ten years from date
of grant. All options are exercisable upon vesting. The options
typically vest over four years at a rate of 25% of the shares
underlying the option one year from date of grant and at a rate
of 2.08% monthly thereafter.

The Amended and Restated 1995 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan (the “Director Option
Plan”) was originally adopted by the Board of Directors on
September 28, 1995 and approved by the Company’s
stockholders in October 1995. The Director Option Plan provides
for the grant of options to purchase a maximum of 3,600,000 (as
adjusted for stock splits) shares of Common Stock of the Company
to non-employee directors of the Company.

Pursuant to the Director Option Plan, each
non-employee director is eligible to receive an initial grant of
an option to purchase 60,000 shares of Common Stock and an
annual grant of an option to purchase 20,000 shares of Common
Stock on the first business day of the month following the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, provided that no annual grant
shall be granted to any non-employee director in the same
calendar year that such person received his or her initial
grant. The initial grant vests 1/3 after the conclusion of the
first year and 1/36 per month over the remaining two years. The
annual grant vests in equal monthly increments over a period of
one year. All options granted under the Director Option Plan
have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of grant and a term of ten years from
the date of grant. Options are exercisable to the extent vested
only while the optionee is serving as a director of the Company
or within 90 days after the optionee ceases to serve as a
director of the Company.

Information about stock options outstanding as of

Stock Purchase Plan

The Third Amended and Restated 1995 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “1995 Purchase Plan”) was
originally adopted by the Board of Directors on
September 28, 1995 and approved by the Company’s
stockholders in October 1995. The 1995 Purchase Plan provides
for the issuance of a maximum of 9,000,000 shares of Common
Stock upon the exercise of non-transferable options granted to
participating employees. All U.S.-based employees of the Company
whose customary employment is 20 hours or more per week and more
than five months in any calendar year, and employees of certain
international subsidiaries, are eligible to participate in the
1995 Purchase Plan. Employees who would immediately after the
grant own 5% or more of the Company’s Common Stock and
directors who are not employees of the Company, may not
participate in the 1995 Purchase Plan. To participate in the
1995 Purchase Plan, an employee must authorize the Company to
deduct an amount (not less than 1% nor more than 10% of a
participant’s total cash compensation, up to a maximum of
$25,000) from his or her pay during six-month periods (each a
“Plan Period”).

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock an
employee may purchase in any Plan Period is 6,000 shares subject
to certain other limitations. The exercise price for the option
for each Plan Period is 85% of the lesser of the market price of
the Common Stock on the first or last business day of the Plan
Period. If an employee is not a participant on the last day of
the Plan Period, such employee is not entitled to exercise his
or her option, and the amount of his or her accumulated payroll
deductions are refunded. An employee’s rights under the
1995 Purchase Plan terminate upon his or her voluntary
withdrawal from the 1995 Purchase Plan at any time or upon
termination of employment. In January 2002, the 1995 Purchase
Plan was amended to change the Plan Periods to avoid automatic
purchases of shares of Common Stock from being made during the
Company’s regular black-out periods. Under the 1995
Purchase Plan, the Company issued 473,002 shares, 248,027 shares
and 213,907 shares in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Benefit Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) benefit plan (the
“Plan”) allowing eligible U.S.-based employees to
contribute up to 60% of their annual compensation, limited to an
annual maximum amount as set periodically by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Company, at its discretion, may contribute
up to $0.50 of each dollar of employee contribution, limited to
a maximum of 6% of the employee’s annual compensation. The
Company’s

matching contributions for 2003, 2002 and 2001
were $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
The Company’s contributions vest over a four-year period at
25% per year.

7.  CAPITAL STOCK

Common Stock

The Company has reserved for future issuance
75,246,184 shares of Common Stock for the exercise of stock
options outstanding or available for grant and 10,880,486 shares
for the conversion of the zero coupon convertible debentures
into Common Stock.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In April 1999, the Company’s board of
directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program. During
2003, the Company’s board of directors authorized the
repurchase of an additional $200 million under its stock
repurchase program, increasing the total authority to $800
million, the objective of which is to manage actual and
anticipated dilution. At December 31, 2003, approximately $163.9
million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the
stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as
treasury stock.

The Company is authorized to make open market
purchases of its common stock using general corporate funds.
Additionally, from time to time, the Company has entered into
structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial
institutions using general corporate funds as part of its share
repurchase program in order to lower the average cost to acquire
shares. Some of these programs include terms that require the
Company to make up front payments to the counter-party financial
institution and result in the receipt of shares or a return of
our payments at the maturity of the agreement, depending on
market conditions. The Company has also sold put warrants that
entitled the holder of each warrant to sell to the Company,
generally by physical delivery, one share of its common stock at
a specified price.

The terms of certain put warrants and other
repurchase transactions outstanding at December 31, 2002
required that put warrants and common stock subject to
repurchase be presented separately in our December 31, 2002
balance sheet. Upon settlement, the 2002 transactions were
reclassified to stockholders’ equity when the transactions
matured or expired. There were no put warrant obligations
outstanding at December 31, 2003.

The Company expended an aggregate of $123.9
million and $161.1 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively,
net of premiums received, under all stock repurchase
transactions. During 2003, the Company took delivery of a total
of 8,859,381 shares of outstanding common stock with an average
per share price of $15.86; and during 2002, the Company took
delivery of a total of 17,840,197 shares of outstanding common
stock with an average per share price of $11.83. Some of these
shares were received pursuant to prepaid programs. Since
inception of the stock repurchase programs, the average cost of
shares acquired was $16.28 per share compared to an average
close price during open trading windows of $19.57 per share. As
of December 31, 2003, the Company is a party to a contract
that expires on or before March 29, 2004 and provides that
for up front payments of $40 million, the Company will receive a
number of shares at monthly intervals based on the average
closing price during the contract term less a specified
discount. Due to the fact that the total shares to be received
for the open repurchase agreements at December 31, 2003 is
not determinable until the contracts mature in 2004, the above
price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares subject to
the agreements.

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. The
Company has no present plans to issue such shares.

8.  CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED
DEBENTURES

In March 1999, the Company sold $850 million
principal amount at maturity of its zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”) due
March 22, 2019, in a private placement. The Debentures were
priced with a yield to maturity of 5.25% and resulted in net
proceeds to the Company of approximately $291.9 million, net of
original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of $9.6
million. Except under limited circumstances, no interest will be
paid on the Debentures prior to maturity. The Debentures are
convertible at the option of the security holder at any time on
or before the maturity date at a conversion rate of 14.0612
shares of the Company’s Common Stock for each $1,000
principal amount at maturity of Debentures, subject to
adjustment in certain events. The Company could redeem the
Debentures on or after March 22, 2004. Holders could
require the Company to repurchase the Debentures, on fixed dates
and at set redemption prices (equal to the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount), beginning on March 22,
2004. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a program
authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25 million of the
Debentures in open market purchases. Additionally, in April
2002, the Board of Directors granted additional authority of
$100 million to the Company to repurchase Debentures through
private transactions, bringing the total repurchase authority to
$125 million. The Board of Directors’ authorization to
repurchase the Debentures allows the Company to repurchase
Debentures when market conditions are favorable. As of
December 31, 2003, 76,000 units of the Company’s
Debentures representing $76.0 million in principal amount at
maturity, have been repurchased under these programs for $29.9
million. During 2002, the Company early adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections,

and accordingly, the Company
recorded a gain of approximately $1.6 million during 2002 as a
result of Debenture repurchases since the date of adoption and
is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated income statements. During February
2004 the Company notified holders of the debentures of its
intent to redeem all of the outstanding Debentures. For more
information see Note 17.

9.  FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these
items. The Company’s investments classified as
available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets based primarily on
quoted market prices for such financial instruments. The
aggregate fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale
investments was $346.4 million and $396.3 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company’s held-to-maturity investments had a carrying value
of $192.5 million and $180.4 million at December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $194.5
million and $180.2 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, based on dealer quotation. The carrying amount of
the Company’s Debentures at December 31, 2003 and 2002
were approximately $351.4 million and $333.5 million,
respectively. The fair value of the Debentures, based on the
quoted market price as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
approximately $355.9 million and $334.0 million, respectively.

10.  COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases certain office space and
equipment under various operating leases. In addition to rent,
the leases require the Company to pay for taxes, insurance,
maintenance and other operating expenses. Certain of these
leases contain stated escalation clauses while others contain
renewal options.

Rental expense for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled approximately
$16.4 million, $24.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively.
Rental expense for 2002 includes lease losses associated with
the vacancy of certain of the Company’s leased properties,
as discussed below. Sublease income for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $2.0 million
and $1.7 million, respectively. There was no sublease income
during 2001. Lease commitments under non-cancelable operating
leases with initial or

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

remaining terms in excess of one year and
sublease income associated with non-cancelable subleases,
including estimated future payments under the Company’s
synthetic lease arrangement, are as follows:

The Company is a party to a synthetic lease
arrangement totaling approximately $61.0 million for its
corporate headquarters office space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
The synthetic lease represents a form of off-balance sheet
financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded
100% of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset
to the Company. The synthetic lease qualifies as an operating
lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax
purposes. The Company does not include the property or the lease
debt as an asset or a liability in its consolidated balance
sheets. Consequently, payments made pursuant to the lease are
recorded as operating expenses in the Company’s
consolidated statements of income. The Company entered into the
synthetic lease in order to lease its headquarters properties
under more favorable terms than under its previous lease
arrangements.

The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven
years. Upon approval by the lessor, the Company can renew the
lease twice for additional two-year periods. The lease payments
vary based on LIBOR plus a margin. At any time during the lease
term, the Company has the option to sublease the property and
upon thirty-days’ written notice, the Company has the
option to purchase the property for an amount representing the
original property cost and transaction fees of approximately
$61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding
amounts owed. Upon at least 180 days notice prior to the
termination of the initial lease term, the Company has the
option to remarket the property for sale to a third party. If
the Company chooses not to purchase the property at the end of
the lease term, it has guaranteed a residual value to the lessor
of approximately $51.9 million and possession of the buildings
will be returned to the lessor. If the fair value of the
building were to decline below $51.9 million, the Company would
have to make up the difference under its residual value
guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The synthetic lease includes certain financial
covenants including a requirement for the Company to maintain a
pledged balance of approximately $63.0 million in cash and/or
investment securities as collateral. The Company manages the
composition of the pledged investments and investment earnings
are available for operating purposes. Additionally, the Company
must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance, less
the Company’s Debentures, collateralized investments and
equity investments, of $100.0 million, as of the end of each
fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
approximately $300.1 million in cash and investments in excess
of those required levels. The synthetic lease includes
non-financial covenants, including the maintenance of the
properties and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of financial
statements to the lender of the lessor and prompt payment of
taxes associated with the properties. As of December 31,
2003, the Company was in compliance with all material provisions
of the arrangement.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,

which addresses the
consolidation of variable interest entities in which an
enterprise absorbs a

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

majority of the entity’s expected losses,
receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual
returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other
financial interests in the entity. In December 2003, the FASB
issued FIN No. 46 (revised). FIN No. 46
(revised) is effective immediately for certain disclosure
requirements and variable interest entities referred to as
special-purpose entities for periods ending after
December 15, 2003 and for all types of entities for
financial statements for periods ending after March 15,
2004. The Company has determined that it is not required to
consolidate the lessor, the leased facility or the related debt
upon the adoption of FIN No. 46, as amended. Accordingly, there
was no impact on its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows from adoption. However, if the lessor were to
change its ownership of the property or significantly change its
ownership of other properties that it currently holds, the
Company could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased
facility and the debt in a future period.

During 2002 and 2001, the Company took actions to
consolidate certain of its offices, including the exit of
certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain
leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these
existing operating leases continue to 2025 with a total
remaining obligation at December 31, 2003 of approximately
$29.7 million, of which $4.8 million, net of anticipated
sublease income, was accrued for as of December 31, 2003,
and is reflected in accrued expenses in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. In calculating this accrual,
the Company made estimates, based on market information,
including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and
opportunities. If actual circumstances prove to be materially
worse than management has estimated, the total charges for these
vacant facilities could be significantly higher.

11.  INCOME TAXES

The United States and foreign components of
income before income taxes are as follows:

The components of the provision for income taxes

Taxes,

requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred
tax assets reported if, it is not more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
During 2003, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of
approximately $2.1 million relating to deferred tax assets for
foreign tax credit carryovers.

During the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, the Company recognized tax benefits related to
the exercise of employee stock options in the amount of $10.3
million, $25.7 million, and $28.0 million, respectively. These
benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital. At
December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $44.3
million of additional U.S. net operating loss carryforwards
resulting from stock options, a substantial portion of which
begins to expire in 2020. The Company will record the benefit of
the net operating loss carryforwards generated from the exercise
of employee stock options, in the period that the net operating
loss carryforwards are utilized.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had $23.1
million of remaining net operating loss carryforwards from prior
year acquisitions. The utilization of these net operating loss
carryforwards are limited in any one year pursuant to Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 and begin to expire in 2010.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had
research and development tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $6.9 million that expire beginning in 2018. The
Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$15.6 million at December 31, 2003 that expire beginning in
2004. Additionally, the Company had alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $2.1 million at
December 31, 2003 that have no expiration date.

The Company does not expect to remit earnings
from its foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, during 2003 and 2002
the Company did not provide for deferred taxes on foreign
earnings.

A reconciliation of the Company’s effective
tax rate to the statutory federal rate is as follows:

The Company’s tax provision is based on
expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning
opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which
the Company operates. In the ordinary course of global business,
there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is
uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the
worldwide provision for income taxes and the associated
realizability of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The
Company adjusts its provision as appropriate for changes that
impact its underlying judgments and tax filing positions.

12.  GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS

The Company operates in a single market
consisting of the design, development, marketing, sales and
support of access infrastructure software and services for
enterprise applications. The Company’s revenues are derived
from sales in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. These
three geographic regions constitute the Company’s
reportable segments.

The Company does not engage in intercompany
revenue transfers between segments. The Company’s
management evaluates performance based primarily on revenues in
the geographic locations in which the Company operates. Segment
profit for each segment includes certain sales, marketing,
general and administrative expenses directly attributable to the
segment and excludes certain expenses that are managed outside
the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment profit
primarily consist of research and development costs,
amortization of intangible assets, interest, corporate expenses
and income taxes, as well as, non-recurring charges for
in-process research and development. Corporate expenses are
comprised primarily of corporate marketing costs, operations and
certain general and administrative expenses, which are
separately managed. Accounting policies of the segments are the
same as the Company’s consolidated accounting policies.

increase in the Americas identifiable assets and
decrease in EMEA’s identifiable assets is primarily the
result of this loan repayment.

Export revenue represents shipments of finished
goods and services from the United States to international
customers, primarily in Latin America and Canada. Shipments from
the United States to international customers for 2003, 2002 and
2001 were $24.3 million, $25.3 million and $21.4 million,
respectively.

The Company had net revenue attributed to
individual distributors in excess of 10% of total net sales as

greater than 10% of net sales for any of the years presented.

13.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Cash Flow Hedges.

At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had in place
foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount
of $37.2 million and $48.9 million, respectively, and foreign
currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of
$160.9 million and $128.4 million, respectively. The fair value
of these contracts at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
assets of $12.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively and
liabilities of $4.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively. A
substantial portion of the Company’s anticipated overseas
expense and capital purchasing activities will be transacted in
local currencies. To protect against reductions in value and the
volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency
exchange rates, the Company has established a program that uses
forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce a portion of its
exposure to these potential changes. The terms of these
instruments, and the hedging transactions to which they relate,
generally do not exceed 12 months. Currencies hedged are
Euros, British pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Swiss francs
and Japanese yen. There was no material ineffectiveness of the
Company’s foreign currency forward contracts for 2003, 2002
or 2001.

In order to manage its exposure to interest rate
risk, in November 2001, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap instrument with a notional amount of $174.6 million
that was to expire in March 2004. The swap converted the
floating rate return on certain of the Company’s available
for sale investment securities to a fixed interest rate. In
October 2002, the Company terminated this interest rate swap
instrument. Upon termination, the Company received a cash
payment of $9.2 million as settlement under the swap instrument.
The swap was previously accounted for as an effective cash flow
hedge, and in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 133, the remaining amount in accumulated other
comprehensive income of approximately $2.4 million was
recognized in interest income through the remaining holding
period of the underlying investments in 2002.

In connection with the efforts to manage the
credit quality and maturities of its available-for-sale
investment portfolio, during 2001 the Company terminated a
forward bond purchase agreement previously designated as a hedge
of forecasted purchases of corporate security investments. As a
result, the Company recorded a realized gain of $1.4 million,
which is included in other income (expense), net on the 2001
consolidated statement of income. At the time of the sale, the
Company realized approximately $0.5 million of amounts
previously classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Fair Value Hedges.

The Company uses interest rate swap
instruments to hedge against the change in fair value of certain
of its available-for-sale securities due to changes in interest
rates. The instruments have an aggregate notional amount of
$182.4 million related to specific available-for-sale securities
and expire on

various dates through September 2008. Each of the
instruments swap the fixed rate interest on the underlying
investments for a variable rate based on the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a specified margin. During
2003, the Company sold $104 million of the underlying fixed rate
available-for-sale securities and discontinued hedge accounting
for the related $104 million of the interest rate swaps. Changes
in the fair value of the swap instruments are recorded in
earnings along with related designated changes in the value of
the underlying investments. The fair value of the instruments at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 were liabilities of
approximately $4.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in
earnings. There was no material ineffectiveness of the
Company’s interest rate swaps for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Derivatives not Designated as Hedges.

The Company utilizes credit default
contracts for investment purposes that either do not qualify or
are not designated for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS
No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,

and its related interpretations.
Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these contracts are
recorded in other income (expense), net, if any. Under the terms
of these contracts, the Company assumes the default risk, above
a certain threshold, of a portfolio of specified referenced
issuers in exchange for a fixed yield that is recorded in
interest income. In the event of default by underlying
referenced issuers above specified amounts, the Company will pay
the counterparty an amount equivalent to its loss, not to exceed
the notional value of the contract. The primary risk associated
with these transactions is the default risk of the underlying
issuers. The risk levels of these instruments are equivalent to
“AAA” and “Super AAA” single securities. The
purpose of the credit default contracts is to provide additional
yield on certain of the Company’s underlying
available-for-sale investments.

The Company is a party to three credit default
contracts that have an aggregate notional amount of $75.0
million and expire on various dates through March 2008. The
Company is also a party to a credit default contract that has an
aggregate notional amount of $195.4 million and expires on
March 22, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company has
pledged approximately $83.6 million of investment securities as
collateral for these contracts. The Company maintains the
ability to manage the composition of the pledged investments and
investment earnings are available for operating purposes.
Accordingly, these securities are not reflected as restricted
investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
fixed yield earned on these contracts during 2003 and 2002 is
included in interest income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. To date there have been no credit events
resulting in losses to the Company for the underlying referenced
entities. As of December 31, 2003, the fair value of these
contracts was not material.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
Company had $12.8 million and $6.3 million of derivative assets,
respectively, and $9.4 million and $6.2 million of derivative
liabilities, respectively, representing the fair values of the
Company’s outstanding derivative instruments, which are
recorded in other current assets, other assets and accrued
expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
change in derivatives recognized in other comprehensive income
includes unrealized gains (losses) that arose from changes
in market value of derivatives that were held during the period,
and gains (losses) that were previously unrealized, but
have been recognized in current period net income due to
termination or maturities of derivative contracts. This
reclassification has no effect on total comprehensive income or
stockholders’ equity. The following table presents these
components of other comprehensive income, net of tax for the
Company’s derivative instruments (in thousands):

14.  EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earnings per share:

The above antidilutive weighted shares to
purchase shares of Common Stock includes certain shares under
the Company’s stock option program, certain put warrants
under the Company’s stock repurchase program and Common
Stock potentially issuable on the conversion of the Debentures
and were not included in computing diluted earnings per share
because their effects were antidilutive for the respective
periods.

15.  RECENT ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

. This statement amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003, for hedging relationships designated after
June 30, 2003, and to certain preexisting contracts. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 149 and there was no material
impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash
flows from adoption.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

. This
statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and
measures in its financial position certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In
accordance with this standard, financial instruments that embody
obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as
liabilities. SFAS No. 150 generally is effective for
financial instruments created or modified after May 31,
2003, and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 150 and there was no material impact on
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows from
adoption.

In November 2002, the FASB’s Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) reached a final consensus on Issue
No. 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables,

which is effective for revenue
arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2003. Under EITF Issue No. 00-21, revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables are required to be
divided into separate units of

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accounting under certain circumstances. The
Company adopted EITF Issue No. 00-21 on July 1, 2003,
and such adoption did not have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,

Revenue Recognition,

which codifies, revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB
No. 101,

Revenue Recognition,

in order to make this
interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative
guidance. The changes noted in SAB No. 104 did not have a
material impact upon the Company’s financial position, cash
flows or results of operations.

16.  LEGAL MATTERS

The Company is a defendant in various litigation
matters generally arising out of the normal course of business.
Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of
these cases, management believes, based on discussions with
counsel, that any ultimate liability would not materially affect
the Company’s business, financial position, result of
operations or cash flows.

17.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Redemption of Convertible Subordinated
Debentures.

On February 19, 2004,
the Company notified all holders of the Debentures of its intent
to call all of the outstanding Debentures on March 22,
2004. As of the notice date, debentures in an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $773.8 million were
outstanding. The aggregate redemption price of the Debentures
will be approximately $355.7 million. The Company currently
intends to use the proceeds from the maturity of our two
AAA-rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as
held-to-maturity investments that mature on March 22, 2004
to fund the majority of the aggregate redemption price. The
Company believes that its cash on hand and the sale of certain
available-for-sale investments will be sufficient to fund
balance of the aggregate redemption price. Additionally, at the
date of redemption, the Company will incur a charge for the
associated prepaid debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2
million, which will be reflected in other income (expense), net
in March 2004.

Acquisition of Expertcity.

On December 18, 2003, the Company
entered into a merger agreement with Expertcity, a market leader
in Web-based desktop access as well as a leader in Web-based
training and customer assistance products. On February 27,
2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Expertcity. The results of operations of
Expertcity will be included in the Company’s results of
operations beginning after February 27, 2004.

The consideration for this transaction was
approximately $231 million, comprised of approximately
$112.6 million in cash and approximately 5.6 million shares of
the Company’s common stock valued at approximately $118.4
million. The merger agreement provides for additional purchase
price consideration of up to approximately 0.6 million shares of
Citrix common stock to be issued to the Expertcity stockholders
in the event certain revenue and other financial milestones are
achieved by the Expertcity business in 2004. For purposes of
calculating the number of shares of Citrix common stock issued
to the Expertcity stockholders, the merger agreement provides
that shares of Citrix common stock issued as initial
consideration or as additional purchase price consideration be
valued on the average closing price of the Company’s common
stock for ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days
prior to the closing of the merger, or approximately $20.12 per
share. Additional purchase price consideration earned by the
Expertcity stockholders, if any, will be calculated by dividing
the amount earned pursuant to the merger agreement by
approximately $20.12 per share. The fair value of the shares
issued as additional purchase price consideration, if any, will
be based on the market value of the Company’s common stock
at the date that the shares are earned. In addition to the
purchase price, there were direct transaction costs associated
with the merger of approximately $4.0 million. Additional
purchase price payments, if any, and direct transaction costs
associated with the merger are expected to be recorded to
goodwill.

Independent valuation specialists are conducting
a valuation in order to assist the Company in determining the
fair values of a significant portion of Expertcity’s net
assets. The work being performed by the independent valuation
specialists was considered in management’s preliminary
allocation of the purchase price summarized below.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the
total estimated purchase price was allocated to
Expertcity’s net tangible and intangible assets based on
their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of
the acquisition. Due to the preliminary nature of the
allocation, amounts may be adjusted when the valuation is
finalized, in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business
Combinations

. The estimated purchase price is preliminarily
allocated as follows (in thousands):

Net assets acquired from Expertcity consisted
mainly of cash and investments, accounts receivable, deferred
revenues and other current liabilities.

The fair values used in the preliminary purchase
price allocation were based on estimated discounted future cash
flows, royalty rates and historical data, among other
information. The estimated purchased in-process research and
development is expected to be expensed immediately upon closing
of the merger in accordance with FIN No. 4,

Applicability of
FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for
by the Purchase Method

due to the fact that it pertains to
technology that was not currently technologically feasible,
meaning it had not reached the working model stage, did not
contain all of the major functions planned for the product, was
not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative
future use.

The Company expects to record approximately
$162 million of goodwill resulting from the acquisition,
which will not be deductible for tax purposes.
