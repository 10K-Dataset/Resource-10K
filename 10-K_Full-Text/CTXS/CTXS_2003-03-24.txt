BUSINESS

General

Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix” or the
“Company”), a Delaware corporation founded on
April 17, 1989, is a leading supplier of access
infrastructure software and services that enable the effective
and efficient enterprise-wide deployment and management of
applications and information, including those designed for
Microsoft® Windows® operating systems, for UNIX®
operating systems, such as Sun Solaris

TM

, HP-UX or
IBM® AIX® (collectively “UNIX operating
systems”) and for Web-based information systems. The
Company’s MetaFrame® products permit organizations to
provide secure access to Windows based, Web-based and UNIX
applications without regard to location, network connection, or
type of client hardware platforms. The Company markets and
licenses its products through multiple channels such as
value-added resellers, distributors, system integrators and
independent software vendors, managed by the Company’s
worldwide sales force. The Company also promotes its products
through relationships with a wide variety of industry
participants, including Microsoft Corporation
(“Microsoft”).

The Business Need for Simplified Access to
Information

Globalization, increasing worker mobility and
computing devices and the expectation of “instant”
results set by the Internet have made it vital for businesses to
supply users with fast, simple and secure access to information
and applications so that they can work effectively from
anywhere, on any type of device or network connection. However,
enterprises face significant roadblocks to access, especially
complexities and incompatibilities among computing platforms and
infrastructures, applications and communications protocols.
Demand has increased for systems that offer users a standard,
consistent interface on any device, fast transmission of data
over a variety of networks, and the ability to deliver
applications and information securely to local and remote users
over public networks, especially the Internet. Some of the
challenges to true virtual access are:

Enabling “The On-Demand
Enterprise”

Citrix aims to address these challenges by
enabling any number of people, from anywhere in the world, using
any kind of computing device, over any network connection, to
access the on-demand enterprise.



Citrix access infrastructure software enables
workers to find, organize and interactively work with business
applications and information securely from virtually anywhere.
At the same time, Citrix access infrastructure software enables
corporate information technology (“IT”) teams to
centrally provide, manage and support secure access to
applications, including those designed for Windows, Web and UNIX
operating systems, while monitoring service quality, measuring
resource usage and controlling access. Citrix® products and
services enable enterprise resources to be efficiently and
securely available “on demand” across the Internet,
intranets, extranets, wide area networks, local area networks
and wireless networks to remote and mobile employees.

Citrix access infrastructure software enables
organizations to reduce the costs of corporate computing,
increase employee productivity, gain flexibility to
technological change within their data centers, improve
resilience to business interruption and gain greater control
over the quality of enterprise IT services.

The Citrix® Software Suite For
Enterprise Resource Access

Citrix’s strategy is to provide an
integrated suite of technologies, products and services that
allow customers to achieve the following business solutions for
enterprise resource access:



Citrix Technology

Citrix products are based on a full range of
industry-standard technologies. In addition, some Citrix
products also include the Company’s proprietary
technologies known as the Independent Computing Architecture
(“ICA”) protocol, which allows an application’s
graphical user interface to be displayed on virtually any client
device while the application logic is executed on a central
server. Because the ICA® protocol moves client-based
application processing to the server, this approach enables
centralized management of applications, users, servers, licenses
and other system components for greater efficiency and lower
cost.

The Company’s ICA® technology also
minimizes the amount of data traveling across a user’s
network as only encrypted screen refreshes, keystrokes and mouse
clicks are transported to and from the client device. This
increases remote access security, improves application
performance and allows even wireless access to the latest, most
powerful applications and information.

The Citrix products are also based on the
industry-standard Extensible Markup Language (“XML”).
Leveraging XML assures open systems interaction for customers
regardless of data source or platform. And by supporting XML,
which is the standard for future Web services-based
applications, Citrix helps customers get from the client/server
world of today to the Web services environments of tomorrow.

Citrix Products

The Company’s products are marketed under
the Citrix MetaFrame® brand and include MetaFrame 1.8 for
Windows Terminal Server and the MetaFrame XP™ presentation
servers and the MetaFrame Secure Access Manager. Citrix
MetaFrame products run primarily on Microsoft Windows server
operating systems. The Company also provides a MetaFrame
presentation server that runs on UNIX operating systems. This
suite of infrastructure software and services enable
organizations to better deploy, manage and access applications
across the extended enterprise to a variety of client devices,
operating platforms or network connections.

The MetaFrame software suite includes two
products that work together and can also be used separately.
These products are licensed with software subscription, or
Citrix Subscription Advantage

TM

, offering customers
all updates, when and if they become available during the first
year of their license.

•

MetaFrame Presentation Servers.

Citrix MetaFrame presentation servers
    are available for both Windows based applications and UNIX based
    applications. The MetaFrame XP presentation servers for Windows
    based products are optimized for Windows NT®, Windows 2000
    and Windows XP applications. These servers are designed to
    support large-scale implementations with as many as 100,000
    users on 1,000 or more servers. MetaFrame XP presentation server
    for Windows is offered in three editions — MetaFrame
    XPs, MetaFrame XPa and MetaFrame XPe. Each edition is tailored
    to specific customer needs and computing environments.

•

Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access Manager.

Introduced in June 2002 as NFuse®
    Elite, Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access Manager is based on
    technology acquired from Sequoia Software Corporation in April
    2001. Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access Manager provides secure,
    single-point access over the Web to a wide range of internal and
    external information resources including applications, data
    resources, documents, Web content and services. With a powerful
    set of easy-to-use, wizard-driven configuration tools,
    information technology administrators can enable browser-based
    access to the entire enterprise — personalized to each
    user’s needs, with secure connectivity over the Web.

•

Citrix Subscription Advantage.

To provide customers with the easiest
    and most convenient way to keep their Citrix software current,
    the Company markets software under the Citrix Subscription
    Advantage brand for an additional fee. Citrix Subscription
    Advantage is the Company’s terminology for post-contract
    support (“PCS”). Citrix Subscription Advantage is an
    annual, renewable program that provides subscribers with
    automatic delivery of software upgrades, enhancements and
    maintenance releases when and if they become available during
    the term of their subscription.



Collectively, these products accounted for
approximately 89%, 86%, and 85% of the Company’s net
revenues in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Citrix® Services

Citrix provides a portfolio of technical services
designed to allow the Company’s end-customers and entities
with which it has a technology relationship to maximize the
value of Citrix access infrastructure software. These services
are available as a feature of the Company’s
business-development program and are available for additional
fees to end-customers.

•

Citrix Consulting
    Services

TM

(“CCS”). The objective of CCS is to help ensure the
    successful implementation of Citrix technologies. Tested
    methodologies, certified professionals and best practices
    developed from real-world experience allow CCS to provide expert
    guidance and support to our partners and customers to maximize
    the effectiveness of their total application server computing
    environment.

•

Citrix Technical Support Services.

To accommodate the unique ongoing
    support needs of customers, preferred support services are
    specifically designed to address the variety of challenges
    facing application server software environments. Citrix offers
    five support-level options, global coverage and personalized
    relations management.

•

Product Training & Certification.

A series of courses are designed to
    allow customers and channel members to learn new skills and
    effective strategies to help plan, implement and administer
    Citrix products. Students may attend courses at one of over 300
    Citrix Authorized Learning Centers

TM

(“CALC”) worldwide.

Services revenue accounted for approximately 8%
of the Company’s net revenues in 2002 and 7% in 2001 and
2000.

Citrix Customers

Citrix’s primary target markets for its
current products and services are large and medium-sized
organizations in commercial, government and education sectors.
Currently, Citrix has more than 120,000 customers worldwide,
including 100% of the

Fortune

100, 95% of the

Fortune

500 and 95% of the

Financial Times

FT Europe 100.
During 2002, Citrix’s enterprise customers included U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Deutsche Telecom, Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaris, Swiss Federal Railways, Deutsche
Angestellten Krankenkasse and Ministry of Finance of the State
of North Rhine Westphalia.

The Company’s software licenses are
generally perpetual and are offered in both “shrink
wrapped” and electronic-based forms. The Company
distributes its software using various formats including
traditional “boxed” packages for small projects and
customers, and electronically downloaded formats for its large
projects and customers.

For medium to large-sized projects, which
typically consist of large “multi-server”
environments, the Company offers electronic volume-based
licensing programs. These programs provide for volume-based
licensing that allow usage of the Company’s products both
on a department or enterprise-wide basis. These licenses include
electronically delivered “software activation keys”
that enable feature configuration ordered by the customer.
Depending on the license type and customer preference, the
software media is delivered by a channel distributor or directly
by the Company. The Company has invested, and continues to
invest, in large-account relationship professionals, license
fulfillment channels and entities with which we have
service-oriented system integration relationships to assist
these larger customers with broader usage of the Company’s
software infrastructure.

These large-account selling investments have
contributed to an increase in sales of MetaFrame software under
these electronically delivered volume-based licensing
arrangements in 2002 as compared to 2001. For the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, sales under volume-based
licensing arrangements constituted



39% and 27%, respectively, of product sales, a
portion of which has been deferred. The Company plans to hire
additional end-customer sales professionals to increase its
marketing efforts aimed at large corporate accounts.

Technology Relationships

The Company has entered into a number of
technology relationships to develop customer markets for its
products, broaden the use of the ICA protocol as an emerging
industry standard technology for distributed Windows and non
Windows applications and to accelerate the development of its
existing and future product lines.

Microsoft.

Since its
inception, the Company has had a number of license agreements
with Microsoft, including licenses relating to Microsoft OS/2,
Windows 3.x, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, Windows CE and
Internet Explorer. These agreements have provided the Company
with access to certain Microsoft source and object code,
technical support and other materials. The license agreements
had an initial term that expired in September 1994 and was
subsequently extended until September 2001.

In May 1997, the Company entered into a five-year
joint license, development and marketing agreement with
Microsoft, (as amended, the “Microsoft Development
Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company licensed its
multi-user Windows NT extensions to Microsoft for inclusion in
future versions of Windows NT server software. Pursuant to the
Microsoft Development Agreement, the Company’s multi-user
Windows NT extensions technology was incorporated into
Microsoft’s NT Terminal Server, which was released in July
1998, and Windows 2000 Server, which was released in February
2000. Additionally, Microsoft agreed to endorse only the
Company’s ICA protocol as the preferred way to provide
multi-user Windows access for devices other than Windows client
devices, an obligation that expired in November 1999. Since
November 1999, Microsoft has been permitted to market or endorse
other methods to provide multi-user Windows access to
non-Windows client devices, and these methods compete with
products of the Company. This agreement with Microsoft expired
in May 2002. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Overview,” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future
Results.”

In May 2002, the Company signed an agreement with
Microsoft to formalize continued access to Microsoft Windows
Server source code. Under this agreement, the Company will have
access to source code for Microsoft server operating systems
from Windows 2000 Server and beyond, including access to
terminal services source code, during the three-year term of the
agreement. This agreement does not provide for payments to or
from Microsoft.

There can be no assurances that the
Company’s agreements with Microsoft will be extended or
renewed by Microsoft upon their respective expirations or that,
if renewed or extended, such agreements will be on terms
favorable to the Company.

Additional Relationships.

As of December 31, 2002, the
Company had entered into approximately 130 ICA license
agreements. Currently, more than 200 different devices
incorporate Citrix ICA, ranging from Linux terminals to
information appliances, such as wireless phones and handheld
devices. ICA licensees include Wyse Technologies,
Hewlett-Packard, Neoware, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Motorola, Samsung,
Sharp, Symbol Technologies and Nokia, among others.

In addition, the Citrix Business Alliance™
(“CBA”) is a coalition of industry-leading companies
from across the IT spectrum who work with the Company to design
and market complementary solutions for the Company and CBA
customers. By the end of 2002, CBA membership had grown to
approximately 1,200 members, including hardware, software,
global and regional consulting alliances. CBA members include
Microsoft, Dell, IBM, EMC


, Hewlett-Packard, Siebel
Systems, PeopleSoft, SAP AG, JD Edwards, Mercury
Interactive, Fujitsu, Verizon Wireless, Sprint PCS, Sun
Microsystems and National Semiconductor.

Research and Development

The Company focuses its research and development
efforts on developing new products and core technologies for its
markets and further enhancing the functionality, reliability,
performance and flexibility of existing products. The Company
solicits extensive input concerning product development from
users, both directly from end-customers and indirectly through
its channel distributors.



The Company believes that its software
development team and core technologies represent a significant
competitive advantage for the Company. Included in the software
development team is a group focused on research activities that
include prototyping ways to integrate emerging technologies and
standards into the Company’s product offerings, such as
emerging Web services technologies and Microsoft’s new
Windows Server 2003 technologies. Other groups within the
software development team have expertise in XML-based software
development, multi-tier Web-based application development and
deployment, secure sockets layers-based (“SSL”) secure
access, and application “sandbox” technologies. The
software development team also includes a number of key
employees who were instrumental in the release of
Microsoft’s Window’s NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition,
have expertise in UNIX operating system environments (Solaris,
AIX, HP-UX, and Linux), and were key members from the
engineering team that developed the original version of OS/2 at
IBM. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company incurred research
and development expenses of approximately $68.9 million,
$67.7 million and $50.6 million, respectively.

Sales, Marketing and Support

The Company markets and licenses its products
through multiple channels worldwide, including value added
resellers, distributors, System Integrators (“SI”s)
and Independent Software Vendors (“ISV”s), managed by
the Company’s worldwide sales force. The Company provides
training and certification to integrators, value-added resellers
and consultants for a full-range of MetaFrame-based application
deployment and management solutions and services through its
Citrix Solutions Network™ (“CSN”) program.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had
relationships with approximately 100 distributors and
approximately 5,200 CSN providers worldwide. A number of
entities with which the Company has channel relationships
provide additional end-customer sales channels for the
Company’s products under either a Citrix brand or embedded
in the licensee’s own software product.

During 2002, the Company took steps to improve
the effectiveness of its channel relationships. The Company
plans to continue to take actions to strengthen its channel
relationships, including improving channel incentive programs,
eliminating non-performing channel relationships, adding new
members with expertise in selling into new vertical markets and
forming additional relationships with global and regional SIs
and ISVs. SIs and ISVs are currently expected to become a more
central part of Citrix’s strategy in the enterprise and
government markets. New programs supporting each group were
launched in 2002. The SI program includes members such as IBM,
HP, Computer Sciences Corporation, Electronic Data Systems
Corporation, Schlumberger, Siemens and Unisys. The ISV program
has a strong representation across industry verticals such as
healthcare, telecom, financial, manufacturing, retail and
government. Vendors in the ISV program include Amdocs, Cerner,
Dell, McKesson, Siemens Medical Health Solutions,
Reynolds & Reynolds and ESRI.

The Company’s sales and marketing
organization actively supports its distributors and resellers.
The Company’s marketing department provides training, sales
event support, sales collateral, advertising, direct mail and
public relations coverage to its indirect channels to aid in
market development and in attracting new customers. The
Company’s sales organization consists of field-based
systems sales engineers and corporate sales professionals.
Additional sales personnel, based in North America, Europe,
Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, support these field
personnel. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Results of Operations” and Note 12 to the Company’s
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding the Company’s geographic segments. These
additional sales personnel recruit prospective customers,
provide technical advice with respect to the Company’s
products and work closely with key distributors and resellers of
the Company’s products. During 2002, the Company grew its
end-customer sales force of sales professionals that work
closely with medium and large enterprise customers to achieve
the appropriate combination of relationships for licensing,
integration and consulting to meet customers’ needs. These
and other account penetration efforts are part of the
Company’s strategy to increase the usage of Citrix software
within the customer’s IT organization.

The Company provides most of its distributors
with product return rights only for the purpose of stock
balancing. These transactions are estimated and provided for at
the time of sale as a reduction of revenue. Stock balancing
rights permit distributors to return products to the Company,
subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of other Citrix
products. The Company is not obligated to accept product returns
from its



distributors under any other conditions, unless
the product item is defective in manufacture. Product items
returned to the Company under the stock-balancing program must
be in new, unused and unopened condition. The Company also
provides most of its distributors with price protection rights.
Price protection rights require that the Company grant
retroactive price adjustments for inventories of Citrix products
held by distributors if the Company lowers its prices for such
products within a specified time period. In the event that the
Company decides to reduce its prices, it will establish a
reserve to cover exposure to distributor inventory. The Company
has not reduced and has no current plans to reduce the prices of
its products for inventory currently held by distributors or
resellers.

The majority of the Company’s service
activities are related to post-sale technical support, pre- and
post-sale consulting and product training services. Post-sale
technical support is offered through Citrix-operated support
centers located in the United States, Ireland and Australia. The
Company provides technical advice to channel distributors and
entities with which the Company has a technology relationship,
who act as the first line of technical assistance for
end-customers, in most cases. In some cases, end-customers can
also choose from a Citrix-delivered fee-based support program
ranging from one-time incident charges to an enterprise-level
support agreement covering multiple sites and servers. In
addition, the Company also provides free technical advice
through on-line support systems, including its Web-based
“Knowledge Center.” For pre-and post-sale consulting,
Citrix Consulting Services (“CCS”), a consulting
services organization, provides both exploratory and fee-based
consulting services. These services include on-site systems
design and implementation services targeted primarily at
enterprise-level clients with complex IT environments. The CCS
organization is also responsible for the development of best
practice knowledge that is disseminated to businesses with which
Citrix has a business relationship and end-customers through
training and written documentation. Leveraging these best
practices enables the Company’s integration resellers to
provide more complex systems, reach new buyers within existing
customer organizations and provide more sophisticated system
proposals to prospective customers. Training services in selling
techniques and technical expertise areas are provided through
the Company’s CALC program, which includes approximately
300 of the world’s leading IT training organizations. These
training programs are designed for businesses and end-customers
and include courses for system administration and advanced
system integration. CALCs are staffed with instructors that have
been certified by Citrix and teach their students using
Citrix-developed courseware.

Operations

The Company controls all purchasing, inventory,
scheduling, order processing and accounting functions related to
its operations. Production, warehousing and shipping are
performed both internally and by independent contractors on a
purchase order basis in the United States and in Ireland,
depending upon the customer’s geographic market. Master
software CD-ROMs, development of user manuals, packaging
designs, initial product quality control and testing are
performed at the Company’s facilities. In some cases,
independent contractors duplicate CD-ROMs, print documentation,
and package and assemble product to the Company’s
specifications. To date, the Company has not experienced any
material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly
of its products. Internal manufacturing capabilities and
independent contractors provide a redundant source of
manufacture and assembly.

The Company generally ships products upon receipt
of an order. As a result, the Company does not have significant
backlog at any given time, and does not consider backlog to be a
significant indicator of future performance.

Competition

The Company believes that other software
companies have entered or could enter the market with solutions
that involve a similar approach to the Citrix access
infrastructure software. In particular, Tarantella Inc., GraphOn
Corporation, Netilla Networks, Inc., and New Moon Systems, Inc.
market products that claim to have functions similar to those
found in Citrix MetaFrame.

In addition, alternative products exist that
directly or indirectly compete with the Company’s products
and anticipated future product offerings. Existing or new
products that extend Internet software to provide database
access or interactive computing could materially impact the
Company’s ability to sell its products in this market.
Competitors in this market include Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Sun
Microsystems and other makers



of Web-application software. As markets for the
Company’s products continue to develop, additional
companies, including companies with significant market presence
in the computer hardware, software and networking industries
could enter the markets in which the Company competes and
further intensify competition. These competitors and other
potential competitors often have significantly greater
financial, technical, sales, marketing, support and other
resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to establish and maintain a market position
in the face of increased competition. Additionally, price
competition could become more significant in the future;
although the Company believes that price has historically been a
less significant competitive factor than product performance,
reliability and functionality. The Company may not be able to
maintain its historic prices, which could adversely affect the
Company’s business, results of operations and financial
condition.

See “— Technology
Relationships” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future
Results.” The announcement of the release, and the actual
release, of products competitive to the Company’s existing
and future product lines, could cause existing and potential
customers of the Company to postpone or cancel plans to license
certain of the Company’s existing and future product
offerings, which would adversely impact the Company’s
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Proprietary Technology

The Company’s success is dependent upon
certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property.
The Company has been awarded a number of domestic and foreign
patents and has a number of pending patent applications in the
United States and foreign countries. The Company’s
technology is also protected under copyright laws. However,
patent protection and existing copyright laws afford only
limited protection for the Company’s technology. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the
Company’s proprietary rights to the same extent, as do the
laws of the United States. Accordingly, the Company also relies
on trade secret protection and confidentiality and proprietary
information agreements to protect its proprietary technology.
The Company has trademarks or registered trademarks in the
United States and other countries, including Citrix(R), ICA(R),
MetaFrame(R), MetaFrameXP

TM

and the Citrix(R) logo.
The loss of any material trade secret, trademark, trade name or
copyright could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
There can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to
protect its proprietary technology rights will be successful.
Despite the Company’s precautions, it could be possible for
unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the
Company’s products or to obtain and use information that
the Company regards as proprietary. A significant portion of the
Company’s sales is derived from the licensing of Company
packaged products under “shrink wrap” and
“click-to-accept” electronic license agreements that
are not signed by licensees and volume-based licensing
agreements that are delivered electronically, all of which could
be unenforceable under the laws of many jurisdictions in which
the Company licenses its products. Additionally, third parties
have asserted infringement claims against the Company and, as
the number of products and competitors in its industry segments
increases and the functionality of these products overlap, the
Company could become increasingly subject to infringement
claims. Companies and inventors are more frequently seeking to
patent software and business methods because of developments in
the law that could extend the ability to obtain such patents. As
a result, the Company could receive more patent infringement
claims. Responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its
validity, could result in costly litigation or require the
Company to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of
those third parties. Licenses may not be available on reasonable
terms or at all. In addition, attention to these claims could
divert management’s time and attention from developing the
Company’s business. Although the Company does not believe
that its products infringe on the rights of third parties, if a
successful claim is made against the Company and the Company
fails to develop or license a substitute technology, the
Company’s business, results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

While the Company’s competitive position
could be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary
information, the Company believes that because of the rapid pace
of technological change in the industry, factors such as the
technical expertise, knowledge and innovative skill of the
Company’s management and technical personnel, its
technology relationships, name recognition, the timeliness and
quality of support services provided by the Company and its
ability to rapidly develop, enhance and market software products



could be more significant in maintaining the
Company’s competitive position. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future
Results.”

other facilities in Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific
region. In addition, the Company owns land and buildings in the
United Kingdom with approximately 48,000 square feet of office
space.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

In February 2002, a stockholder filed a complaint
(the “Complaint”) in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware against the Company and certain of its current
and former officers and directors. The Complaint purported to
state a direct claim on behalf of a putative class of
stockholders and a derivative claim nominally on behalf of the
Company for breach of fiduciary duty based on the Company’s
alleged failure to disclose all material information concerning
the Company’s business and operations in connection with a
proposal to be voted on at the Company’s annual meeting of
stockholders in May 2000. The Complaint asserted claims similar
to those alleged by such stockholder in a suit that was filed in
September 2000, and subsequently voluntarily dismissed without
prejudice in July 2001. The Complaint sought compensatory
damages, rescission of the Company’s 2000 Director and
Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and other related
relief. The parties have since agreed to a non-monetary
settlement of the action not involving the validity of the 2000
Director and Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The
settlement is subject to approval by the court. A hearing on the
approval of the settlement has not yet been scheduled.

In addition, the Company is a defendant in
various matters of litigation generally arising out of the
normal course of business. Although it is difficult to predict
the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, based
on discussions with counsel, that any ultimate liability would
not materially affect the Company’s financial position,
result of operations or cash flows.

Price Range of Common Stock and Dividend
Policy

The Company’s Common Stock is currently
traded on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
“CTXS.” The following table sets forth the high and
low closing prices for the Company’s Common Stock as
reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the periods
indicated, as adjusted to the nearest cent. Such information
reflects inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, markdown or
commission and may not represent actual transactions.

On March 7, 2003, the last reported sale
price of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq National Market was
$11.65 per share. As of March 7, 2003, there were
approximately 1,129 holders of record of the Common Stock.

The Company currently intends to retain any
earnings for use in its business and to repurchase shares of its
Common Stock. The Company does not currently anticipate paying
any cash dividends on its capital stock in the foreseeable
future.

In connection with the Company’s stock
repurchase program, in October 2000, the Board of Directors
approved a program authorizing the Company to sell put warrants
that entitle the holder of each warrant to sell to the Company,
generally by physical delivery, one share of the Company’s
Common Stock at a specified price. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources,” for information regarding the Company’s
sale of put warrants during 2002. The issuance of these
securities is exempt from registration under Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
    OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We develop, market, license and support access
infrastructure software and services that enable effective and
efficient enterprise-wide deployment and management of
applications and information, including those designed for
Microsoft Windows operating systems, for UNIX operating systems,
such as Sun Solaris, HP-UX or IBM-AIX, or collectively UNIX
operating systems, and for Web-based information systems. Our
largest source of revenue is the MetaFrame XP

TM

Presentation Server products. Our MetaFrame products, which we
began shipping in the second quarter of 1998, permit
organizations to provide access to Windows based, Web-based, and
UNIX applications without regard to location, network connection
or type of client hardware platforms. We market and license our
products through multiple channels such as value-added
resellers, distributors, system integrators and independent
software vendors, managed by our worldwide sales force. We also
promote our products through relationships with a wide variety
of industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation.

In May 1997, we entered into a five-year joint
license, development and marketing agreement with Microsoft,
which expired in May 2002. Under that agreement, or the
Microsoft Development Agreement, we licensed our multi-user
Windows NT extensions to Microsoft for inclusion in certain
versions of its Windows NT server software. We recognized
revenue from the Microsoft Development Agreement ratably over
the five-year term of the contract in other revenues in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.

In May 2002, we signed an agreement with
Microsoft to formalize continued access to Microsoft Windows
Server source code. Under this agreement, we will have access to
source code for current and future Microsoft server operating
systems from Windows 2000 Server and beyond, including access to
terminal services source code, during the three-year term of the
agreement. This agreement does not provide for payments to or
from Microsoft.

Acquisitions

We have acquired technology related to our
strategic objectives. In April 2001, we acquired Sequoia
Software Corporation for $182.6 million in cash. Sequoia
provided XML-based portal software. The Sequoia technology is a
core component of our MetaFrame Secure Access Manager software
that was launched in June 2002 as NFuse Elite.

In February 2000, we acquired all of the
operating assets of Innovex Group, Inc. for approximately
$47.8 million. On the date of the acquisition, we paid
approximately $28.9 million in cash, including closing
costs. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, we were
required to pay the remaining purchase price, plus interest, if
certain events occurred. During 2001, these events occurred and,
as a result, we paid the remaining purchase price and the
associated interest of $10.5 million in cash in August 2001
and $10.7 million in cash in February 2002. We have no
remaining contingent obligations.

We accounted for these acquisitions under the
purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 16,

Accounting for
Business Combinations.

We allocated the cost of the
acquisitions to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values. Except for the Innovex
acquisition, a portion of the acquired intangible assets were
related to research and development that had not reached
technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative
future use.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base these
estimates on our historical experience and on various



other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, and these estimates form the
basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments
based on available information and experience. Actual results
could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and
conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our
estimates, our financial condition and results of operations
could be materially impacted.

We believe that the accounting policies described
below are critical to understanding our business, results of
operations and financial condition because they involve more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the
development, selection and application of our critical
accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of
directors, and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure
relating to our critical accounting policies in this
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

Other significant accounting policies, primarily
those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed
below, are also critical to understanding our consolidated
financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial
statements contain additional information related to our
accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this
discussion.

Cash Equivalents and Investments.

The fair value of certain of our cash
equivalents and investments is dependent on the performance of
the companies or funds in which we invest, including equity
investments that are accounted for under the cost method due to
the limited extent of our ownership interest and lack of our
ability to exert significant influence, and the volatility
inherent in these investment markets. We periodically evaluate
the carrying value of our investments to determine if there has
been any impairment of value that is other-than-temporary, which
would require us to write-down the investments. In assessing
potential impairment, we consider the extent to which recorded
costs exceed market values, the duration of any decline in
market values and the forecasted financial performance of the
issuers. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded
$1.3 million and during the year ended December 31,
2001, we recorded $7.7 million of write-downs resulting
from other-than-temporary declines in fair value of certain of
our investments. At December 31, 2002, we had
$0.2 million in remaining equity investments classified as
long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheet. For
further information regarding risks related to our cash and
investments balances, see “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources,”
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk” and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

We rely on third party valuations in order to
adjust the carrying value of certain of our investments and
derivative instruments to fair value at the end of each period.
Fair values are based on valuation models that use market quotes
and, for certain investments, assumptions as to the
creditworthiness of the entities issuing those underlying
investments.

At December 31, 2002, approximately
$63 million in investment securities were pledged as
collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease.
In addition, at December 31, 2002, approximately
$109 million in investment securities were pledged as
collateral for our credit default contracts. We maintain the
ability to manage the composition of the pledged investments and
accordingly, these securities are not reflected as restricted
investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For
further information see notes 10 and 13 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts Receivable.

Our judgment is required in the
assessment of the collectibility of our customer accounts and
other receivables. We provide for potential uncollectible
accounts receivable based on an evaluation of customer specific
information, historical collection experience and economic
market conditions. If market conditions decline, or if the
financial condition of our customers or distributors
deteriorates, actual collection experience may not meet our
prior expectations and could result in increased bad debt
expenses. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was
$6.1 million at December 31, 2002 and
$3.7 million at December 31, 2001. The increase during
2002 represents reserves based on the financial condition of
certain distributors, none of which are individually
significant. In previous years our bad debt write-offs have not
been significant.



Long-lived Assets.

The determination of the useful lives
of our long-lived assets and whether an asset’s value is
impaired involves significant judgment. These judgments include,
but are not limited to obsolescence, market conditions and
contract life. Useful lives of internal use software, property
and equipment are generally from three to seven years. We
depreciate buildings over a 40-year period.

We review for impairment of long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used
whenever we believe that events or changes in circumstances
indicate that we may not fully recover the carrying amount of
such assets. Determination of recoverability is based on an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposition. We base
measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangible assets that our management
expects to hold and use on the fair value of the asset. We
report long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value minus the costs to sell such assets. During 2002, we
recognized $2.0 million in asset impairment charges
primarily due to the consolidation of certain of our offices
that resulted in the abandonment of certain leasehold
improvements. As of December 31, 2002, we have determined
that there were no other triggering events requiring additional
impairment analysis.

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS,
No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,

which establishes a single accounting
model for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets,
including discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 supersedes
SFAS No. 121 and APB Opinion No. 30,

Reporting the
Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.

Our
adoption of these policies did not have a material impact on our
consolidated results of operations and financial position.

Core and Product Technology Assets.

We review acquired core and product
technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by
comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized
cost of the technology. The core and product technology assets
acquired in our Sequoia acquisition form the basis for our
MetaFrame Secure Access Manager product, launched in June 2002
as NFuse Elite. The recoverability of this technology is
primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize these
products. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased
Sequoia technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows associated with our MetaFrame Secure Access Manager.
Our revenues are forecasted based on data received from pilot
evaluations and early adopters, rate projections on our
installed customer base, and estimates from our sales channels
and end-customer sales force. Our assumptions about future
revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated
with the forecast of MetaFrame Secure Access Manager. Due to the
lack of historical data related to MetaFrame Secure Access
Manager, actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from
these forecasted amounts. As of December 31, 2002, we
estimated that the net realizable value of these core and
product technology assets is greater than the $24.5 million
unamortized cost of these assets. If these products are not
ultimately accepted by our channel or entities with which we
have technology relationships or customers, and there is no
alternative future use for this technology, we could determine
that some or all of the remaining $24.5 million carrying
value of the related core and product technology assets are
impaired. In the event of impairment, we could be required to
incur a charge to earnings that could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

Goodwill and Other
Intangibles.

At December 31,
2002, we had $152.4 million in indefinite lived goodwill and
other intangibles primarily related to our acquisition of
Sequoia. We operate in a single market consisting of the design,
development, marketing and support of access infrastructure
software and services for enterprise applications. Our revenues
are derived from sales in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific regions. These three
geographic regions constitute our reportable segments. See note
12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information regarding our geographic segments. We evaluate
goodwill along these geographic segments. Substantially all of
our goodwill at December 31, 2002 was associated with our
Americas reportable segment.

On January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS
No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. As a
result of adopting SFAS No. 142, our goodwill and certain
intangible assets are no longer amortized but are subject to an
annual impairment test. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we
ceased amortizing goodwill with a net book



value at January 1, 2002 of
$152.4 million, including $10.1 million of acquired
workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets.
Excluding goodwill, we have no intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives.

We use judgment in assessing goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed for
impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed
fair value. Fair values are based on discounted cash flows using
a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent
with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our
current business model. As of December 31, 2002, we
concluded that we could realize our goodwill and other
intangibles based upon projected discounted cash flows. Due to
uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our
strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the
forecasts we use to support our goodwill and other intangible
assets could change in the future, which could result in
non-cash charges that would adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Current and Deferred Tax Assets.

We are required to estimate our income
taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part
of the process of preparing our consolidated financial
statements. We determined the $55.1 million carrying value of
our net deferred tax assets based upon certain estimates and
assumptions, including the assumption that we will be able to
generate enough future tax deductions in certain tax
jurisdictions. If these estimates and assumptions change in the
future, we could be required to record valuation allowances
against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income
tax expenses.

Revenue Recognition.

The accounting related to revenue recognition in the software
industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules
and an understanding of industry practices, both of which are
subject to change. As a result, revenue recognition accounting
rules require us to make significant judgments. In addition, our
judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection,
which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific
information, historical collection experience and economic
market conditions.

We market and license software products through
value-added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators
and independent software vendors, managed by our worldwide sales
force. Our software licenses are generally perpetual, and are
delivered by means of traditional packaged products and
electronically, typically under volume-based licensing programs.
Our packaged products are typically purchased by medium and
small-sized businesses with fewer locations and the software
license is delivered with the packaged product.

Volume-based license arrangements are used with
more complex multi-server environments typically found in larger
business enterprises that deploy our products on a department or
enterprise-wide basis, which could require differences in
product features and functionality at various customer
locations. The end-customer license agreement with enterprise
customers is typically customized based on these factors. Once
we receive a purchase order from the channel distributor, the
volume-based licenses are electronically delivered to the
customer with “software activation keys” that enable
the feature configuration ordered by the end-customer. Depending
on the size of the enterprise, software may be delivered
indirectly by the channel distributor or directly by us pursuant
to a purchase order from the channel distributor.

We recognize revenue when it is earned. Our
revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position,
or SOP, 97-2 (as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9) and related
interpretations,

Software Revenue Recognition

. We
recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met:
persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists; delivery has
occurred and we have no remaining obligations; the fee is fixed
or determinable; and collectibility is probable. We define these
four criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists. We
    recognize revenue on packaged product upon shipment to
    distributors and resellers. For packaged product sales, it is
    our customary practice to require a purchase order from
    distributors who have previously negotiated a master packaged
    product distribution or resale agreement. For volume-based
    licensing, we typically require a purchase order from the
    distributor or reseller and an executed standard software
    license agreement from the end-customer. We require a purchase
    order for training and services.



•

Delivery has occurred and we have no remaining
    obligations. Our standard delivery method is free-on-board
    shipping point. Consequently, we consider delivery of our
    packaged product to have occurred when the products are shipped
    to distributors pursuant to an agreement and purchase order. We
    consider delivery of licenses under electronic licensing
    agreements to have occurred when the related products are
    shipped and the end-customer has been electronically provided
    with the licenses that include the activation keys that allow
    the end-customer to take immediate possession of the software.
    For training and service revenue recognition, we fulfill our
    obligation when the services are performed.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable. In the normal
    course of business, we do not provide end-customers the right to
    a refund of any portion of their license fees or extended
    payment terms. When we sell our software products separately, we
    determine vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, by the
    price charged for each product. In software arrangements that
    include the rights to multiple software products, post-contract
    customer support, or PCS, and/or other services, we allocate the
    total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the
    relative fair value of each of the deliverables based on VSOE.
    If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each
    undelivered element based on VSOE, we defer revenue until all
    elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or
    until fair value can be objectively determined.

•

Collectibility is probable. We determine
    collectibility on a customer-by-customer basis. We typically
    sell to distributors or resellers for whom there are histories
    of successful collection. New customers are subject to a credit
    review process that evaluates the customers’ financial
    position and ultimately their ability to pay. Customers are
    subject to an ongoing credit review process. If we determine
    from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not
    probable, we defer revenue recognition until customer payment is
    received and the other parameters of revenue recognition
    described above have been achieved. Our judgment is required in
    assessing the probability of collection, which is generally
    based on evaluation of customer specific information, historical
    experience and economic market conditions. If market conditions
    decline, or, if the financial condition of our distributors or
    end-customers deteriorates, we may be unable to determine that
    collectibility is probable, and we could be required to defer
    the recognition of revenues until we receive customer payment.

For certain software products that are only sold
bundled with PCS, we allocate revenue to the delivered software
product using the residual method. Under the residual method, we
do not sell the software products separately and thus we are
generally unable to determine VSOE of fair value for the
product. Therefore, we allocate discounts inherent in the
arrangement entirely to the software product and the portion of
the fee initially allocated to PCS and deferred is generally
higher than in arrangements with established VSOE for the
software product. Depending on future product releases or
changes in customer demand, we may offer additional products
that are only sold bundled with PCS. If we do this, the use of
the residual method will become more prevalent, which could
impact the timing of our revenue recognition since more of the
sales proceeds would be allocated to the PCS portion of the
arrangement and recognized over the PCS period. We also sell PCS
separately through our Citrix Subscription Advantage renewal
program, and we determine VSOE by the renewal price charged. We
base technical service and PCS revenues from customer
maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product
updates and upgrades on the price charged or derived value of
the undelivered elements and are recognized ratably over the
term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. We
include technical service revenues in net revenues in the
consolidated statements of income.

In the normal course of business, we do not
permit product returns, but we do provide most of our
distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and
price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit
distributors to return products to us, subject to ordering an
equal dollar amount of our products. Price protection rights
require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for
inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if
we lower our prices for such products. We establish provisions
for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection
rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the
recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based
upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among
other things, historical return rates for both specific products
and distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by
product, the impact of any new product releases and projected
economic conditions. Actual product returns for stock balancing
and price protection provisions incurred are, however,



dependent upon future events, including the
amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the
level of distributor inventories at the time of any price
adjustments. We continually monitor the factors that influence
the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and
makes adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual
returns and other allowances could differ from established
reserves. Our ability to recognize revenues upon shipment to our
distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate
future product returns and rotation. If actual return experience
or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate
returns and rotation, we would be required to defer the
recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the
end-user customer. Allowances for estimated product returns
amounted to approximately $10.5 million at
December 31, 2002 and $8.3 million at
December 31, 2001. We have not reduced and have no current
plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by
distributors or resellers. Accordingly, there were no reserves
required for price protection at December 31, 2002 or 2001.
We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
and incentive offerings including volume-based incentives. If
market conditions were to decline, we could take actions to
increase our customer incentive offerings and possibly result in
an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the
incentive is offered.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,

defines a fair value method of
accounting for issuance of stock options and other equity
instruments. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is
measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award
and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the
vesting period. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, companies are not
required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for
employee stock-based transactions. Companies are permitted to
account for such transactions under APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

but are
required to disclose in a note to the consolidated financial
statements pro forma net income and per share amounts as if a
company had applied the methods prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

We apply APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations, which do not require us to recognize
compensation cost, in accounting for stock options granted to
employees and non-employee directors, and we have complied with
the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. Except for
non-employee directors, we have not granted any options to
non-employees. For further information regarding our stock
option plans, see note 6 to our consolidated financial
statements.

The following discussion relating to the
individual financial statement captions, our overall financial
performance, operations and financial position should be read in
conjunction with the factors and events described in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Overview”
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors
Which May Affect Future Results” which could impact our
future performance and financial position.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth our consolidated
statements of income data and presentation of that data as a

not meaningful.

Net Revenues.

Our
operations consist of the design, development, marketing and
support of access infrastructure software and services that
enable effective and efficient enterprise-wide deployment and
management of applications and information.

We present net revenues in the following three
categories outlined below: License Revenue, Technical Services
Revenue, and Royalty Revenue. License Revenue primarily
represents fees related to the licensing of our MetaFrame
products, Subscription Advantage (our terminology for PCS),
additional user licenses and management products (such as load
balancing and resource management products). Technical Services
Revenue consists primarily of technical support services,
product training and certification, and consulting services
related to implementation of our software products. We recognize
Technical Services and PCS revenues from customer maintenance
fees or ongoing customer support ratably over the term of the
contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Royalty
Revenue represents the fees recognized in connection with the
Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002.

The decrease in net revenues in 2002 was due
primarily to a decrease in the number of MetaFrame licenses
sold, which resulted from a decrease in packaged product sales
due to an overall weakness in information technology spending
and a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our
distributors. In the near term, we do not anticipate further
material reductions in packaged product inventory held by our
distributors. The decrease in packaged product sales was
partially offset by an increase in volume-based licensing sales,
mainly to medium and large customers. In addition, the decrease
in net revenue also resulted



from a significant decline in Royalty Revenue due
to the expiration of the Microsoft Development Agreement in May
2002.

The increase in net revenues in 2001 was
primarily attributable to an increase in License Revenue
resulting from an increase in the number of MetaFrame licenses
sold for Windows operating systems, specifically due to market
acceptance of our MetaFrame XP access infrastructure software
introduced in February 2001. The increase in net revenues in
2001 also resulted from an increase in Technical Services
Revenue due primarily to an increase in larger scale
volume-based licensing arrangements that typically require
professional services to ensure successful implementation of our
technologies.

Deferred revenues as of December 31, 2002
primarily related to Citrix Subscription Advantage and Technical
Services revenues. Excluding those deferred revenues associated
with the Microsoft Development Agreement, deferred Citrix
Subscription Advantage and Technical Services Revenues increased
approximately $32 million as compared to December 31,
2001. This increase was due primarily to increased renewals of
Citrix Subscription Advantage.

An analysis of our net revenues is presented
below:

International and Segment Revenues.

International revenues (sales outside
of the United States) accounted for approximately 53.7% of our
net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, 48.0% of
our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, and
40.3% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000.
During 2002, the significant increase in our international
revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a
weakness in packaged product sales in the United States and the
expiration of the Microsoft Development Agreement in May 2002.
During 2001, the significant increase in our international
revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily the
result of increased sales and marketing efforts and continued
demand for our products in Europe and Asia, as well as the
economic impact of slower information technology spending in the
United States during 2001. We expect that the difficult economic
conditions that existed in 2002 will persist in 2003.

An analysis of our geographic segment net revenue
as a percentage of net revenue is presented below:

(1)

Our Americas segment is comprised of the United
    States, Canada and Latin America.

(2)

Defined as Europe, Middle East and Africa.

(3)

Represents royalty fees in connection with the
    Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired during May 2002.

With respect to our geographic segment revenues,
the decrease in net revenues during 2002 as compared to 2001 was
due primarily to the factors mentioned above, as well as a
decline in packaged product sales in Europe. During 2001,
revenues notably increased in our Asia-Pacific segment,
particularly due to increased



sales in Japan, and in our EMEA segment,
particularly due to increased sales in Europe. For additional
information on international revenues, please refer to note 12
to our consolidated financial statements.

Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues consisted primarily
of the cost of royalties, product media and duplication,
manuals, packaging materials and shipping expense. Cost of
revenues also consisted of compensation and other
personnel-related costs of providing consulting services. We
expensed all development costs incurred in connection with the
Microsoft Development Agreement as incurred in cost of other
revenues. Our cost of revenues excludes amortization of core
technology, which is shown as a component of amortization
expense in our consolidated statements of income. During 2001,
we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system. As a
result of this implementation, we have an enhanced ability to
obtain information regarding personnel-related costs of
providing consulting services revenues. The decrease in the cost
of revenues for 2002 as compared to 2001, is primarily
attributable to our ability to identify certain non-revenue
generating services expenses and classify such costs as
operating expenses. Volume-based license sales are typically
fulfilled with a nominal level of product media and the licenses
are delivered electronically. The cost of fulfilling such sales
is less than traditional packaged product sales, thereby
reducing costs of revenues as a percentage of revenue.

The increase in cost of revenues for 2001 was due
to an overall increase in our packaged product sales and
increases in compensation and other costs of providing services
revenues. These increases were offset in part by a reduction of
the level of inventory necessary to fulfill customer orders due
to increased market acceptance of volume-based licenses.

Gross Margin.

Gross
margin as a percent of revenue was 96.4% for 2002, 95.0% for
2001 and 93.8% for 2000. The increase in gross margin as a
percentage of net revenue from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to
the decrease in cost of revenues as discussed above. The
increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue from
2000 to 2001 was primarily due to larger reserves for obsolete
inventory recorded in 2000. To a lesser extent, the increase in
gross margin during 2001 was also due to an increase in
volume-based licensing, as discussed above. We currently
anticipate that in the next 12 months, gross margin as a
percentage of net revenues will remain relatively unchanged as
compared with current levels. However, gross margin could
fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors
attributable to the cost of revenues as described above.

As further discussed below, during 2002 we
reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately 10%
(approximately 200 employees) and consolidated certain
functions from our Salt Lake City, Utah and Columbia, Maryland
facilities into our Fort Lauderdale, Florida facility. As a
result of such actions, we incurred expenses of approximately
$10.9 million, primarily for severance and related facility
expenses, of which approximately $7.0 million were included
in research and development expenses, $2.8 million were
included in sales, marketing and support expenses and
$1.1 million were included in general and administrative
expenses. We currently expect that increases in insurance
premiums and higher foreign currency expenses, impacted by a
weaker dollar exchange rate, and investments in new products,
will offset savings from these actions.

Research and Development
Expenses.

Research and development
expenses consisted primarily of personnel-related costs. We
expensed all development costs included in the research and
development of software products and enhancements to existing
products as incurred except for core technologies acquired.
Research and development expenses increased during 2002
primarily from an increase in staffing and associated salaries
that primarily related to the Sequoia acquisition in the second
quarter of 2001, additional costs for severance for the
worldwide workforce reduction, and relocation and facility
related charges associated with the consolidation of our Salt
Lake City, Utah and Columbia, Maryland development teams into
our remaining engineering facilities during 2002. These
increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs for
third party software, external consultants and developers and a
decrease in personnel costs due to the worldwide workforce
reduction.

Research and development expenses increased in
2001 primarily from additional staffing, associated salaries and
related expenses. The increase in 2001 was also due to costs
incurred for third party software and



external consultants and developers used to
expand and enhance our product lines, including feature releases
of MetaFrame and research and development efforts on anticipated
future product offerings.

Sales, Marketing and Support
Expenses.

Sales, marketing and support
expenses increased during 2002 primarily from additional
end-customer sales personnel hired during 2001 and 2002
particularly for medium to large customers, an increase in
staffing and associated salaries related to the Sequoia
acquisition during 2001, and severance charges associated with
our worldwide workforce reduction. To a lesser extent, the
reallocation of certain non-revenue generating services expense
from cost of revenues to operating expenses also contributed to
the increase. The increase was partially offset by a reduction
in marketing costs due to a refocus in marketing programs
spending based on the current operating environment, and the
reallocation of certain overhead expenses to other departments,
primarily depreciation expense to certain general and
administrative cost centers.

Sales, marketing and support expenses increased
in 2001 primarily from increased personnel for sales, services
and marketing and associated salaries, commissions and related
expenses focused on our sales, consulting and marketing efforts.
Included in such marketing efforts in 2001 was the expansion of
our end-customer sales force in connection with marketing to
large corporate enterprise accounts. The increase was also due
to a higher level of marketing programs directed at customer and
business partner acquisition and retention, and additional
promotional activities related to specific products, such as
MetaFrame XP introduced in February 2001.

General and Administrative
Expenses.

General and administrative
expenses increased in 2002 primarily from a reallocation of
certain overhead expenses from other departments to general and
administrative expenses, primarily depreciation expense from
certain sales, marketing and support cost centers into certain
general and administrative cost centers.

General and administrative expenses increased in
2001 primarily from increased staff, associated salaries and
related expenses necessary to support overall increases in the
scope of our operations. The increase during 2001 also resulted
from increased depreciation from our enterprise resource
planning system implemented in 2001, as well as the reallocation
of certain overhead costs from other departments into certain
general and administrative cost centers and an increase in
consulting and accounting fees.

Amortization of Intangible
Assets.

On January 1, 2002, we
adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. Under the new rules, we no longer amortize goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives but
subject them to an annual impairment test. At the date of
adoption, we had unamortized goodwill, including acquired
workforce, in the amount of $152.4 million, which is no
longer amortized. The decrease in amortization of intangible
assets during 2002 was substantially due to the adoption of SFAS
No. 142. Other intangibles of $36.6 million at
January 1, 2002 continue to be amortized over their useful
lives. As of December 31, 2002, we had unamortized
identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the
net amount of $30.8 million. We recorded $11.3 million
during 2002 and $48.8 million, during 2001 in amortization
expense.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we
completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets at the date of adoption and
again during the fourth quarter of 2002. There were no
impairment charges recorded as a result of the adoption of SFAS
No. 142 or impairment tests. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect
Future Results.”

The increase in amortization of goodwill and
identifiable intangible assets in 2001 was primarily due to our
acquisition of Sequoia in April 2001. This acquisition resulted
in additional goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of
approximately $169.9 million at the date of acquisition.
Additionally, for 2001, the increase was also due to additional
goodwill of approximately $16.2 million associated with
contingent purchase price payments related to the acquisition of
Innovex.

In-Process Research and
Development.

In April 2001, we
acquired Sequoia, of which $2.6 million of the purchase
price was allocated to in-process research and development, or
IPR&D. The amounts allocated to



IPR&D had not yet reached technological
feasibility, had no alternative future use and were written off
at the time of the acquisition. There were no write-offs of
IPR&D during 2002.

Write-Down of
Technology.

We periodically review our
finite lived intangible assets to determine if any impairment
exists. In June 1998, we completed the acquisition of APM Ltd.,
or APM. The acquired core technology consisted primarily of a
Java software product that would operate in a MetaFrame server
environment. At the time of the acquisition, we anticipated that
there would be a growing demand for Java client applications.
After the acquisition, the market did not develop as we
originally anticipated. In the second quarter of 2000, we
changed the Java application server product to a Java
Performance Pack product, which adds performance enhancements
and management tools to our other products. By the fourth
quarter of 2000, we had developed a Java Performance Pack and
had assessed the market demand for this technology. As of
December 31, 2000, we did not believe that there were
sufficient projected cash flows to support the net book value of
the core technology associated with the APM acquisition. In
addition, we determined that there was no alternative future use
for the acquired technology. As a result, we recorded a
write-down of $7.3 million, representing the net book value
of the APM core technology as of December 31, 2000.

In July 1998, we completed the acquisition of
VDOnet Corporation Ltd., or VDOnet. The acquired core technology
consisted primarily of the ICA Video Services project, which
allowed video applications and applications containing videos to
be viewed on an ICA client. Subsequent development efforts
resulted in the VideoFrame™ 1.0 product, which shipped in
the third quarter of 1999, but resulted in few sales to
end-customers. After the acquisition, we explored alternative
uses for the acquired technology. By the third quarter of 2000,
we had explored uses related primarily to delivering video
applications in a server-based computing environment and video
streaming with ICA devices. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we
reviewed potential modifications to our cash flow projections
based on identified alternative uses for the technology. As a
result of our evaluation, we did not believe that there were
sufficient projected cash flows to support the carrying value of
the core technology. As a result, we recorded a write-down of
$1.8 million, representing the net book value of the VDOnet
core technology as of December 31, 2000.

Interest Income.

Interest income decreased during 2002 primarily due to a
decrease in interest rates. During 2002, we terminated an
interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of
$174.6 million and in December 2002, we sold the
investments underlying this swap agreement. As a result, the
decrease in interest income during 2002 was partially offset by
interest income of approximately $3.4 million recognized as
a result of the termination of this interest rate swap and the
hedging relationship. For more information see “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” and note 13 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Interest income increased in 2001 as compared to
2000 principally from our decision to change the composition of
our investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2000 from
tax-exempt and taxable to predominantly taxable securities,
partially offset by a decrease in interest rates during 2001.

Interest Expense.

The decrease in interest expense for 2002 as compared to 2001
was due primarily to interest expense incurred during 2001 on
contingent payments associated with the Innovex acquisition.

The increase in interest expense for 2001 as
compared to 2000 was primarily due to interest on contingent
payments associated with the Innovex acquisition, as well as the
accretion of the original issue discount related to the zero
coupon convertible subordinated debentures issued in March 1999.

Other Expense, Net.

Other expense, net is primarily comprised of
other-than-temporary declines in the value of our equity
investments and realized gains (losses) on the sale of
available-for-sale investments, as well as, remeasurement and
foreign currency transaction gains (losses). The increase in
other expense, net for 2002 as compared to other expense, net in
2001 was the result of $2.1 million of losses from
other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain of
our equity investments and realized losses on the sale of
available-for-sale securities, as well as approximately
$1.1 million in remeasurement and foreign currency
transaction losses.

The change in other expense, net for 2001 as
compared to other expense, net for 2000 was the result of
$7.7 million of losses recorded in 2001 resulting from
other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain of
our equity investments, as well as approximately
$2.4 million in remeasurement and foreign currency



transaction losses partially offset by realized
gains of $8.0 million associated with purchases and sales
of available-for-sale securities and associated contracts.

Income Taxes.

The
decrease in the effective tax rate from 31% in 2001 to 17% in
2002 was due primarily to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,
pursuant to which amortization of goodwill, which previously
increased taxable income in the determination of our effective
tax rate, ceased. The reduction in the tax rate was also due to
higher tax credits related to our foreign operations and
research and development, and the cessation of revenues from the
Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002.

The increase in the effective tax rate from 30%
in 2000 to 31% in 2001 resulted primarily from non-deductible
goodwill associated with the acquisition of Sequoia offset in
part by a rate decrease resulting from increased foreign
earnings which were taxed at lower foreign tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2002, we generated positive operating cash
flows of $187.1 million. These cash flows related primarily
to net income of $93.9 million, adjusted for, among other
things, tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock
options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock
options of $25.7 million, non-cash charges, including
depreciation and amortization expenses of $41.4 million,
provisions for product returns of $25.3 million (primarily
due to our stock rotation program) and the accretion of original
issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our
convertible subordinated debentures of $17.7 million. These
cash inflows were partially offset by an aggregate decrease in
cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of
$16.9 million. Our investing activities provided
$0.1 million of cash consisting primarily of the net
proceeds, after reinvestment, from sales and maturities of
investments of $29.0 million, offset by the expenditure of
$19.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment
and net cash paid for acquisitions (a contingent payment
resulting from the February 2000 Innovex acquisition) of
approximately $10.7 million. Our financing activities used
cash of $184.2 million related primarily to the expenditure
of $192.1 million for the stock and debt repurchase
programs, partially offset by the proceeds received from
employee stock compensation plans and the sale of put warrants
of $8.0 million.

During 2001, we generated positive operating cash
flows of $229.8 million. These cash flows related primarily
to net income of $105.3 million, adjusted for, among other
things, tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock
options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock
options of $28.0 million, non-cash charges, including
depreciation and amortization expenses of $79.6 million,
provisions for product returns of $22.5 million (primarily
due to our stock rotation program) and the accretion of original
issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our
convertible subordinated debentures of $17.9 million. These
cash inflows were partially offset by an aggregate decrease in
cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of
$38.3 million. Our investing activities used
$382.2 million of cash consisting primarily of net cash
paid for acquisitions (primarily in connection with the
acquisition of Sequoia) of $183.8 million, the net purchase
of investments of $137.9 million and $60.6 million for
our purchase of property and equipment and costs associated with
our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system implementation.
Approximately $12.0 million was capitalized through
December 31, 2001, related to our ERP system. We used
$83.0 million in cash in financing activities related
primarily to our expenditure of $210.2 million for stock
repurchase programs, partially offset by the proceeds from the
issuance of common stock under our employee stock compensation
plans of $117.4 million and $12.0 million generated
from premiums received upon the sale of put warrants.

Cash and Investments

As of December 31, 2002, we had
$719.4 million in cash and investments, including
$142.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition,
we had $186.4 million in working capital at
December 31, 2002. The $27.3 million decrease in cash
and investments as compared to December 31, 2001, is due
primarily to continued common stock and debt repurchases,
capital expenditures and a contingent acquisition payment as
discussed above, partially offset by positive cash flow from
operations. We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in
investment grade, highly liquid securities to allow for
flexibility in the event of immediate cash



needs. Our short and long-term investments, other
than $0.2 million of equity investments, consist of
interest bearing securities.

In December 2000, we invested $158.1 million
in a trust managed by an investment advisor. The purpose of the
trust is to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event that our
debentures are redeemed in March 2004. Our investment in the
trust matures on March 22, 2004, and comprises all of the
trust’s assets. The trust’s assets primarily consist
of AAA-rated zero-coupon corporate securities. The trust entered
into a credit risk swap agreement with the investment advisor,
which effectively increased the yield on the trust’s assets
and for which value the trust assumed the credit risk of ten
investment-grade companies. The effective yield of the trust,
including the credit risk swap agreement, is 6.72% and the
principal balance will accrete to $195 million in March
2004. Therefore, beginning with the quarter ending
March 31, 2003, we will classify the investment as a
short-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet to
reflect the amount that will be due within one year of the
balance sheet date. We record our investment in the trust and
the underlying investments and swap as held-to-maturity
zero-coupon corporate security in our consolidated financial
statements. We do not recognize changes in the fair value of the
held-to-maturity investment unless a decline in the fair value
of the trust is other-than-temporary, in which case we would
recognize a loss in earnings. Our investment is at risk to the
extent that one of the underlying corporate securities has a
credit event resulting in non-payment to the counterparty that
may include bankruptcy, dissolution, or insolvency of the
issuers. There have been no losses associated with the
trust’s underlying corporate securities to date. The
amortized cost of our investment in the trust was approximately
$180.4 million at December 31, 2002 and
$169.0 million at December 31, 2001, which we
classified as long-term corporate investments in our
consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2002, the fair
value of the trust’s assets was $180.2 million.

In addition, we have invested in other
instruments with similar credit risk features. This means that
these investments are at risk to the extent that the entities
issuing the underlying corporate securities have credit events
above specified amounts that result in a loss to the
counterparty. There have been no credit events associated with
the entities issuing the underlying corporate securities to
date. For more information see notes 4 and 13 to our
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2001, we entered into an interest
rate swap agreement with a notional amount of approximately
$174.6 million. The interest rate swap agreement
effectively converted a like amount of floating rate notes in
our investment portfolio to a synthetic zero coupon investment
due in March 2004 with a maturity value of approximately
$190 million. In October 2002, we terminated this interest
rate swap agreement. Upon termination, we received a cash
payment of $9.2 million as settlement under the swap
agreement, and gained approximately $2.4 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. We
previously accounted for the interest rate swap as a cash flow
hedge in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133.
During December 2002, certain investments underlying the swap
were sold, and hedge accounting was terminated and the
associated other comprehensive income was recognized through
earnings.

Accounts Receivable, Net

At December 31, 2002, we had approximately
$69.5 million in accounts receivable, net of allowances.
The modest increase in accounts receivable as compared to 2001
is primarily attributed to an increase in sales in the
Asia-Pacific region for the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared
to the fourth quarter of 2001, partially offset by an increase
in worldwide allowances. From time to time, we could maintain
individually significant accounts receivable balances from our
distributors or customers, which are comprised of large business
enterprises, governments and small and medium-sized businesses.
If the financial condition of our distributors or customers
deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected.
One such distributor accounted for approximately 7% of gross
accounts receivable as of December 31, 2002. In 2001, this
distributor accounted for 14% of gross accounts receivable.
During these periods, no other distributor or customer accounted
for more than 10% of accounts receivable.



Convertible Subordinated Debentures

In March 1999, we sold $850 million
principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures due in March 2019, in a private
placement. The debentures were priced with a yield to maturity
of 5.25%. Our net proceeds were approximately
$291.9 million, net of original issue discount and net of
debt issuance costs of $9.6 million. Except under limited
circumstances, we will pay no interest prior to maturity. The
security holders can convert the debentures at any time on or
before the maturity date at a conversion rate of 14.0612 shares
of our common stock for each $1,000 principal amount at maturity
of the debentures, subject to adjustment in certain events. We
can redeem the debentures on or after March 22, 2004, and
the holders of the debentures can require us to repurchase the
debentures on fixed dates and at set redemption prices (equal to
the issue price plus accrued original issue discount) beginning
on March 22, 2004. Accordingly, beginning with the quarter
ended March 31, 2003, we will classify the debentures as a
current liability on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect
the amount that will be payable on demand within one year of the
balance sheet date. We will maintain sufficient liquidity in the
event that holders of the debentures require us to redeem or we
elect to repurchase the debentures.

In October 2000, our board of directors approved
a program authorizing us to spend up to $25 million to
repurchase debentures in open market purchases. Additionally, in
April 2002 our board of directors granted us the additional
authority to repurchase up to $100 million in debentures
through private transactions, bringing our total repurchase
authority up to $125 million. As of December 31, 2002,
we have repurchased 76,000 units for approximately
$29.9 million, which represents $76.0 million in
principal amount at maturity. During 2002, we adopted SFAS
No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44,
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections

earlier than required, and therefore we recorded
an operating gain of approximately $1.6 million during 2002
as a result of our debenture repurchases. The board of
directors’ limited authorization to repurchase the
debentures allows us to repurchase debentures when market
conditions are favorable.

In December 2000, we invested $158.1 million
in investments accounted for as held-to-maturity corporate
securities to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event that
our debentures are redeemed in March 2004. Based on the
$195.0 million expected maturity value of the investments
in March 2004, the proceeds of the investments will be
sufficient to fund the redemption of approximately 55% of the
debentures, if required. We believe that we will have sufficient
cash and investments to fund the redemption of the remaining
debentures in 2004, if required.

Stock Repurchase Program

Our board of directors has authorized
$600 million of repurchase authority under our stock
repurchase program, in order to manage actual and anticipated
dilution. We record all repurchased shares as treasury stock.

We are authorized to make open market purchases
of our common stock using general corporate funds. During 2002,
we purchased 9,300,000 shares of outstanding common stock on the
open market for approximately $75.7 million (at an average
per share price of $8.14).

From time to time, we enter into arrangements
with financial institutions as part of our share repurchase
program in order to lower our average cost to acquire shares.
These arrangements are described below.

We were party to two agreements, executed during
2001 and 2000, with a large financial institution, to purchase
approximately 7.3 million shares of our common stock at
various times in private transactions. Under the terms of the
agreements, we paid this institution an aggregate of
$150 million, with the ultimate number of shares
repurchased dependent on market conditions. In May 2002, the
agreements were terminated and, upon termination, we received
3.0 million of the remaining shares. We received a total of
7,209,286 shares pursuant to these agreements. During 2002, we
entered into a new agreement, as amended, with this financial
institution in a private transaction to purchase up to
3.8 million shares of our common stock at various times
through February 2003. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement,
we paid $25 million to this institution during the third
quarter of 2002. During 2002, we received 2,655,469 shares under
this agreement with a total value of



$18.5 million. The agreement matured in
February 2003 and we received 390,830 of the remaining shares
with a total value of $6.5 million.

During 2002, we entered into two private
structured stock repurchase transactions with a large financial
institution. Under the terms of the first agreement and in
exchange for an up front payment of $25 million, we were
entitled to receive shares of our common stock or a
predetermined cash amount at the expiration of the agreement
dependent upon the closing price of our common stock at
maturity. Upon expiration of the agreement in December 2002, we
received approximately $29.3 million in cash. Under the
terms of the second agreement and in exchange for an up front
payment of $25 million, we are entitled to receive
approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock or a
predetermined cash amount at expiration of the agreement in
March 2003. The form of settlement at maturity of the second
transaction will be dependent upon the closing market price of
our common stock.

We sell put warrants that entitle the holder of
each warrant to sell to us, generally by physical delivery, one
share of our common stock at a specified price. During 2002, we
sold 2,300,000 put warrants at an average strike price of $11.10
and received premium proceeds of $3.3 million. During 2002,
we paid $42.9 million for the purchase of 2,050,000 shares
upon the exercise of outstanding put warrants, and 600,000 put
warrants expired unexercised. As of December 31, 2002,
950,000 put warrants with exercise prices ranging from $7.18 to
$12.58 were outstanding, and expired on various dates between
January and March 2003. As of December 31, 2002, we had a
total potential repurchase obligation of approximately
$9.9 million associated with the outstanding put warrants,
of which $7.3 million is classified as a put warrant
obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. The remaining
$2.6 million of outstanding put warrants permit a net-share
settlement at our option and are not recorded as a put warrant
obligation in our consolidated balance sheet. The outstanding
put warrants classified as a put warrant obligation in our
consolidated balance sheet will be reclassified to
stockholders’ equity when the warrant is exercised or when
it expires. Under the terms of the put warrant agreements, we
must maintain certain levels of cash and investment balances. As
of December 31, 2002, we were in compliance with those
required levels.

In December 2002, we entered into an agreement
with a counterparty, which required that the counterparty sell
to us up to 1,560,000 shares of our common stock at fixed prices
if our common stock trades at designated levels between
December 16, 2002 and January 23, 2003. As of
December 31, 2002, we had a potential remaining repurchase
obligation associated with this agreement of approximately
$9.1 million, which is classified as common stock subject
to repurchase in our consolidated balance sheet. During January
2003, this agreement expired and no shares were repurchased.

We expended an aggregate of $161.1 million
during 2002 and $198.2 million during 2001, net of premiums
received under all stock repurchase transactions. Since
inception of our stock repurchase programs, the average cost of
shares acquired was $16.41 per share compared to an average
close price during open trading windows of $20.26 per share. Due
to the fact that the amount of certain shares received will not
be determined until contract maturity, these per share amounts
exclude up front payments under structured stock repurchase
contracts that had a maturity subsequent to December 31,
2002.

Commitments

In April 2002, we entered into a synthetic lease
with a substantive lessor totaling approximately
$61.0 million for our corporate headquarters office space
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease represents a
form of off-balance sheet financing under which an unrelated
third party lessor funded 100% of the costs of acquiring the
property and leases the asset to us. The synthetic lease
qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a
financing lease for tax purposes. We do not include the property
or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our consolidated
balance sheet. Consequently, we include payments made pursuant
to the lease as operating expenses in our consolidated
statements of income. We entered into the synthetic lease in
order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable
terms than under our previous lease arrangements.

The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven
years. Upon approval by the lessor, we can renew the lease twice
for additional two-year periods. The lease payments vary based
on the London Interbank Offered Rate,



or LIBOR, plus a margin. At any time during the
lease term, we have the option to sublease the property, and
upon thirty-days’ written notice, we have the option to
purchase the property for an amount representing the original
property cost and transaction fees of approximately $61.0
million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts
owed. Upon at least 180 days notice prior to the
termination of the initial lease term, we have the option to
remarket the property for sale to a third party. If we choose
not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, we
have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately
$51.9 million and possession of the buildings will be
returned to the lessor. If the fair value of the building were
to decline below $51.9 million, we would have to make up the
difference under our residual value guarantee, which could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

The synthetic lease includes certain financial
covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a pledged
balance of approximately $63.0 million in cash and/or
investment securities as collateral. We manage the composition
of the pledged investments and investment earnings are available
for operating purposes. Additionally, we must maintain a minimum
cash and investment balance of $100.0 million, excluding
our debentures, collateralized investments and equity
investments, as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of
December 31, 2002, we had approximately $113.5 million
in cash and investments in excess of those required levels. The
synthetic lease includes non-financial covenants including the
maintenance of the properties and adequate insurance, prompt
delivery of financial statements to the lender of the lessor and
prompt payment of taxes associated with the properties. As of
December 31, 2002 we were in compliance with all material
provisions of the arrangement.

Estimated future payments due under this lease
are $1.4 million for 2003, $2.6 million for 2004,
$3.6 million for 2005, $3.7 for 2006 million and $3.7
million for 2007. Estimated lease payments thereafter total
$4.8 million. We have subleased to other entities some of
our leased real property under the synthetic lease.

We lease a significant portion of our worldwide
facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. Future
payments due under these non-cancelable operating leases are
$18.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2003,
$15.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2004,
$15.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2005,
$14.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2006
and 11.6 million for the year ending December 31,
2007. Thereafter, payments due total $41.2 million.

Capital expenditures were $19.1 million
during 2002, $60.6 million during 2001 and
$43.5 million during 2000. During 2002, capital
expenditures were primarily related to leasehold improvements on
newly occupied buildings. The decrease, as compared to 2001, is
due to expenditures in 2001 for buildings, land and our ERP
system. In the normal course of business, we enter into
commitments related to capital expenditures, however, we
currently have no material contractual commitments for capital
expenditures over the next 12 months.

During 2002 and 2001, we took actions to
consolidate certain of our offices, including the exit of
certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain
leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these
existing operating leases continue to October 2018 with a
total remaining obligation of approximately $28.5 million,
of which $6.8 million, net of anticipated sublease income,
was accrued for as of December 31, 2002, and is reflected
in accrued expenses in our consolidated financial statements. In
calculating this accrual, we made estimates, based on market
information, including the estimated vacancy periods and
sublease rates and opportunities. If actual circumstances prove
to be materially worse than management has estimated, the total
charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly
higher.

During 2002 and 2001, significant portions of our
cash inflows were generated by operations. Although we believe
existing cash and investments together with cash flow expected
from operations will be sufficient to meet operating and capital
expenditures requirements for the next 12 months, future
operating results and expected cash flow from operations could
vary if we experience a decrease in customer demand or a
decrease in customer acceptance of future product offerings. We
could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through
the issuance of debt or equity securities. We continue to search
for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make
investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic
objectives. Such



investments could reduce our available working
capital. We currently expect that the difficult economic
conditions that existed during 2002 will persist in 2003.

Certain Factors Which May Affect Future
Results

Our operating results and financial condition
have varied in the past and could in the future vary
significantly depending on a number of factors. From time to
time, information provided by us or statements made by our
employees could contain “forward-looking” information
that involves risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements
contained in this Form 10-K, and in the documents
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, that are not
historical facts, including, but not limited to statements
concerning new products, product development and offerings,
product and price competition, deferred revenues, the Microsoft
source licensing agreement, economic and market conditions,
revenue recognition, growth of revenues, product concentration,
market competition, marketing efforts, technology relationships,
investments in foreign operations and markets, reinvestment of
foreign earnings, gross margins, goodwill, intangible assets,
impairment charges, accounts receivable, amortization, reserves,
in-process research and development valuation, foreign currency
hedging transactions, interest income, anticipated operating and
capital expenditure requirements, reductions in operating
expenses, expenses related to workforce reductions, leasing and
subleasing activities, acquisitions, debt redemption
obligations, stock repurchases, investment transactions,
litigation matters, intellectual property matters, including
proprietary technology protection, distribution channels,
packaged product inventories, stock price, deferred tax assets,
licensing models, sales cycles, trading plans and potential debt
or equity financings constitute forward-looking statements and
are made under the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are
neither promises nor guarantees. Our actual results of
operations and financial condition have varied and could in the
future vary significantly from those stated in any
forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others,
could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in forward-looking statements made in this
Form 10-K, in the documents incorporated by reference into
this Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by our management
from time to time. Such factors, among others, could have a
material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

If Microsoft terminates or fails to renew our
    license agreement, fails to continue to commercialize Windows or
    designs Windows so that it is no longer interoperable with our
    products, our business could be adversely affected.

Microsoft is the leading provider of desktop
operating systems. We depend upon the license of key technology
from Microsoft, including certain source and object code
licenses and technical support. In May 2002, we signed an
agreement with Microsoft to formalize continued access to
Microsoft Windows Server source code. Under this agreement, we
will have access to source code for current and future Microsoft
server operating systems, including access to terminal services
source code, during the three year term of the agreement. Our
relationship with Microsoft is subject to the following risks
and uncertainties, which individually, or in the aggregate,
could cause a material adverse effect in our business, results
of operations and financial condition:

•

Dependence on Microsoft for
    Commercialization.

Our ability to
    successfully commercialize Citrix MetaFrame access
    infrastructure depends on Microsoft’s ability to market
    Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Editions and
    Windows 2000 Servers and the upcoming Windows Server 2003, or
    collectively Windows Server Operating Systems, products. We do
    not have control over Microsoft’s distributors and
    resellers and, to our knowledge, Microsoft’s distributors
    and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from
    Microsoft. Additionally, there could be delays in the release
    and shipment of future versions of Windows Server Operating
    Systems.

•

Termination of the Microsoft Source Licensing
    Agreement.

Microsoft could terminate
    the current agreement before the expiration of the three-year
    term for breach and upon our change of control. If Microsoft
    does terminate the current agreement, our restricted access to
    source code for current and future Microsoft server operating
    systems could negatively impact our ability to release future
    products and enhancements.



•

Interoperability.

Future product offerings by Microsoft may not provide for
    interoperability with our products. The lack of interoperability
    between present or future Microsoft products and our products,
    could cause a material adverse effect on our business, results
    of operations and financial condition.

Our agreements with Microsoft are short in
duration. There can be no assurances that our current agreements
with Microsoft will be extended or renewed by Microsoft after
their respective expirations or that, if renewed such agreements
will be on terms favorable to us. Our failure to renew certain
terms of these agreements with Microsoft could result in an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our business could be adversely impacted by
    conditions affecting the information technology market in
    particular.

The demand for our products depends substantially
upon the general demand for business-related computer hardware
and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors,
including capital spending levels, the spending levels and
growth of our current and prospective customers and general
economic conditions. Fluctuations in the demand for our products
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In 2002, adverse economic
conditions decreased demand for our products and negatively
impacted our financial results. If the current trend of
decreased and slower informational technology spending
continues, it could continue to negatively impact our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Our long sales cycle for enterprise-wide sales
    could make it difficult to predict our quarterly operating
    results.

In recent quarters, a growing number of our large
and medium-sized customers have decided to implement our
volume-based licensing programs on a department or
enterprise-wide basis. For convenience, the licenses under these
arrangements are electronically delivered to our customers. Our
long sales cycle for these large-scale deployments makes it
difficult to predict when these sales will occur, and we may not
be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis. For
example, our electronically delivered licensing arrangements
constituted 39% of our product sales in the year ended
December 31, 2002, a portion of which has been deferred.

We have a long sales cycle for these
enterprise-wide sales because:

The continued long sales cycle for these
large-scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict
the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could
cause significant variability in our revenue and operating
results for any particular period.

Our accounting policies could require us to
    take an impairment charge to earnings, particularly during
    difficult economic conditions.

We have adopted accounting policies that could
require us to take a charge to earnings related to our Sequoia
acquisition. In July 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations,

and in January 2002, we
adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. As a result, we no longer amortize goodwill



and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
lives. However, we continue to amortize certain product and core
technologies, trademarks, patents and other intangibles. We
periodically evaluate our intangible assets, including goodwill,
for impairment. If we determine that any of our intangible
assets are impaired, we could be required to take a related
charge to earnings.

In particular, at December 31, 2002, we had
$30.8 million, net, of unamortized identified intangibles
with estimable useful lives, of which $24.5 million
consists of product and core technology we purchased in the
acquisition of Sequoia. We commercialized and currently market
the Sequoia technology through our secure access infrastructure
software, which includes Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access Manager.
However, our channel distributors and entities with which we
have technology relationships, customers or prospective
customers may not purchase or widely accept our new line of
products. If we are unsuccessful in selling this new line of
products, we could determine that the value of the purchased
technology is impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to
earnings. An impairment charge could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

If we do not develop new products and
    enhancements to our existing products, we may not be
    successful.

The markets for our products are characterized by:

Our future success depends on our ability to
continually enhance our current products and develop and
introduce new products that our customers choose to buy. If we
are unable to keep pace with technological developments and
customer demands by introducing new products and enhancements,
our business, results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely affected. Our future success could be
hindered by:

•

delays in our introduction of new products;

•

delays in market acceptance of new products or
    new releases of our current products; and

•

our, or a competitor’s, announcement of new
    product enhancements or technologies that could replace or
    shorten the life cycle of our existing product offerings.

For example, we cannot guarantee that our secure
access infrastructure software, Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access
Manager, will achieve the broad market acceptance by our channel
and entities with which we have a technology relationship,
customers and prospective customers necessary to generate
significant revenue. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we
will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or
new product announcements by others. If we experience material
delays or sales shortfalls with respect to our new products or
new releases of our current products, those delays or shortfalls
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We believe that we could incur additional costs
and royalties as we develop, license or buy new technologies or
enhancements to our existing products. These added costs and
royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating
expenses. However, we cannot currently quantify the costs for
such transactions that have not yet occurred. In addition, we
may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and
investments to fund these additional costs.

We face intense competition, which could
    result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and
    margins.

We compete in intensely competitive markets. Some
of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly
greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other
resources than us.



Microsoft includes its Remote Desktop Protocol,
or RDP, as a component in certain Windows Server Operating
Systems, which has certain of the capabilities of our ICA®
protocol, and offers customers a competitive solution. Further,
our ability to market the MetaFrame product suite, the MetaFrame
Secure Access Manager products and other future product
offerings could be affected by Microsoft’s licensing and
pricing scheme for client devices, which attach to Windows
Server Operating Systems and utilize our products. Moreover, the
announcement of the release, and the actual release, of new
Window based server operating systems or products incorporating
similar features to our products could cause our existing and
potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license
certain of our existing and future product offerings, which
could adversely impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Future product offerings by Microsoft could
be competitive with our current MetaFrame software suite, and
any of our future product offerings.

Furthermore, the Microsoft Development Agreement
expired in May 2002. Consequently, Microsoft is no longer
contractually restricted from changing its Windows Server
Operating Systems to render them inoperable with our MetaFrame
product offerings. Further, Microsoft is no longer restricted
from assisting third parties to compete with our MetaFrame
products.

In addition, alternative products for Web
applications in the Internet software market directly and
indirectly compete with our current products and anticipated
future product offerings. Existing or new products that extend
Internet software to provide Web-based information access or
interactive computing (such as Microsoft Windows Server 2003
products) can materially impact our ability to sell our products
in this market. Our competitors in this market include
Microsoft, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and other makers of Web
application server software.

As the markets for our products continue to
develop, additional companies, including companies with
significant market presence in the computer hardware, software
and networking industries could enter the markets in which we
compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we
believe price competition could become a more significant
competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be
able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could
adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

We could change our licensing models or the
    percentage of our revenue represented by deferred revenues could
    increase, which could negatively impact our recognition of
    revenue.

We continually re-evaluate our licensing
programs, including specific license models, delivery methods,
and terms and conditions, to market our current and future
products and services. We could implement new licensing
programs, including offering specified and unspecified
enhancements to our current and future product and service
lines. For example, on October 1, 2002, we implemented new
volume-based licensing programs. We could recognize revenues
associated with those enhancements after the initial shipment or
licensing of the software product or over the product’s
life cycle. We could implement different licensing models in
certain circumstances, for which we would recognize licensing
fees over a longer period, which could decrease our current
revenue. For example, we recognize Citrix Subscription Advantage
and Technical Services revenues from customer maintenance fees
or ongoing customer support ratably over the term of the
contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Deferred
revenues from Citrix Subscription Advantage and Technical
Services increased by approximately $32 million in 2002 as
compared to 2001. The timing of the implementation of new
licensing programs, the timing of the release of such
enhancements and other factors could impact the timing of our
recognition of revenues and related expenses associated with our
products, related enhancements and services and could adversely
affect our operating results and financial condition.

As our international sales and operations
    grow, we could become increasingly subject to additional risks
    that could harm our business.

We conduct significant sales and customer support
operations in countries outside of the United States. For the
year ended December 31, 2002, we derived 53.7% of our
revenues from sales outside the United States. Our continued
growth and profitability could require us to further expand our
international operations.



To successfully expand international sales, we
must establish additional foreign operations, hire additional
personnel and recruit additional international resellers. Our
international operations are subject to a variety of risks,
which could cause international revenues to fluctuate. These
risks include:

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to
anticipate and address these risks. We cannot guarantee that
these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or
operating results. In particular, a decrease in demand for
software and services in any particular region could adversely
affect our future operating results.

Our results are subject to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of foreign
currencies in 2002 relative to the value of the U.S. dollar were
generally hedged to minimize adverse impacts on our operating
profit. However, since we generally hedge only one year in
advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses, operations
will be impacted adversely in fiscal 2003. The U.S. dollar
weakened during 2002 relative to other currencies. If the value
of the U.S. dollar continues to weaken relative to other
currencies in which we do business, our results could be
adversely affected in 2004 as well when these currencies are
remeasured for the purposes of converting them to U.S. dollars
for our financial statements.

Sales of our MetaFrame product suite
    constitutes a substantial majority of our revenue.

We anticipate that sales of our MetaFrame product
suite and related enhancements will constitute a substantial
majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Our ability
to continue to generate revenue from our MetaFrame product line
will depend on market acceptance of Windows Server Operating
Systems and/or UNIX Operating Systems. Declines in demand for
our MetaFrame products could occur as a result of:

If our customers do not continue to purchase our
MetaFrame products as a result of these or other factors, our
revenue would decrease and our results of operations and
financial condition would be adversely affected.

Our synthetic lease is an off-balance sheet
    arrangement that could negatively affect our financial condition
    and results.

In April 2002, we entered into a seven-year
synthetic lease with a substantive lessor for our headquarters
office buildings in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic
lease qualifies for operating lease accounting



treatment under SFAS No. 13,

Accounting
for Leases

, so we do not include the property or the lease
debt on our consolidated balance sheet. If new or proposed
accounting standards are adopted by accounting standards
organizations and governmental authorities, we may be required
to include the property and the lease debt in our consolidated
financial statements, and as a result we would incur additional
depreciation expenses.

Under the lease, we must maintain a pledged
balance of approximately $63 million in cash and/or
investment securities with an affiliate of the lessor, serving
as collateral agent. We are able to manage the composition of
the pledged investments and investment earnings are available
for operating purposes. If we default on our commitments under
the synthetic lease and cannot remedy the default in a timely
manner, the lessor could take the pledged assets and transfer
ownership of the real estate to us.

We could purchase the property at any time during
the lease term, with thirty days’ written notice, for the
original property cost plus transaction fees and lease breakage
fees. If we purchase the property, we will be required to add
the property to our consolidated balance sheet. At any time
during the lease term, we could also re-lease the property or
remarket the property for sale to a third party. If we remarket
the property for sale to a third party, we could be required to
find alternate headquarter facilities on terms that may not be
as favorable as the current arrangement. If we elect not to
purchase the property at the end of the lease term, we have
guaranteed a minimum residual value of approximately
$51.9 million to the lessor. Therefore, if the fair value
of the property declines below $51.9 million, we would have
to make up the difference under our residual value guarantee,
which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. For further information on
our synthetic lease, please refer to “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” and note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements.

Our proprietary rights could offer only
    limited protection. Our products could infringe third-party
    intellectual property rights, which could result in material
    costs.

Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may
not be successful. We rely primarily on a combination of
copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to
protect our proprietary rights. The loss of any material trade
secret, trademark, trade name, patent or copyright could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Despite our
precautions, it could be possible for unauthorized third parties
to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or
to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. If we
cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized
copying or use, we may not remain competitive. Any patents owned
by us could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of
our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being
currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope we seek,
if at all, and if issued, may not provide any meaningful
protection or competitive advantage.

In addition, our ability to protect our
proprietary rights could be affected by:

•

Differences in International Law;
    Enforceability of Licenses.

The laws
    of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual
    property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States
    and Canada. For example, we derive a significant portion of our
    sales from licensing our packaged products under “shrink
    wrap” license agreements that are not signed by licensees
    and electronic volume-based licensing agreements that could be
    unenforceable under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions.

•

Third Party Infringement
    Claims.

As the number of products and
    competitors in our industry segments increases and the
    functionality of these products overlap, we could become
    increasingly subject to infringement claims. Companies and
    inventors are more frequently seeking to patent software and
    business methods because of developments in the law that could
    extend the ability to obtain such patents. As a result, we could
    receive patent infringement claims. Responding to any
    infringement claim, regardless of its validity, could result in
    costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to
    intellectual property rights of those third parties. Licenses
    may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. In addition,
    attention to these claims could divert our management’s
    time and attention from developing our business. If a successful
    claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license



a substitute technology, our business, results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows could be
    materially adversely affected.

We are subject to risks associated with our
    technology relationships.

Our business depends on technology relationships.
We cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in
the future. In addition to our relationship with Microsoft, we
rely on technology relationships with IBM, HP, Dell and others.
We depend on the entities with which we have technology
relationships to successfully test our products, to incorporate
our technology into their products and to market and sell those
products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain
our current technology relationships or to develop additional
technology relationships. If any entities in which we have a
technology relationship are unable to incorporate our technology
into their products or to market or sell those products, our
business, operating results and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.

If we lose access to third party licenses,
    shipments of our products could be delayed.

We believe that we will continue to rely, in
part, on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our
products. Third party licensing arrangements are subject to a
number of risks and uncertainties, including:

•

undetected errors in the third party’s
    software;

•

disagreement over the scope of the license and
    other key terms, such as royalties payable; and

•

infringement actions brought by third party
    licensees.

If we lose or are unable to maintain any of these
third party licenses, it could delay the shipment or release of
our products. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our success depends on our ability to attract
    and retain large enterprise customers.

We must retain and continue to expand our ability
to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding
effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting
services. Our inability to attract and retain large enterprise
customers could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Large enterprise
customers usually request special pricing and generally have
longer sales cycles, which could negatively impact our revenues.
Additionally, as we attempt to attract and penetrate large
enterprise customers, we could need to increase corporate
branding and marketing activities, which could increase our
operating expenses. These efforts may not proportionally
increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits.

Our business could be adversely affected if we
    are unable to expand and diversify our distribution
    channels.

We intend to continue to expand our distribution
channels by leveraging our relationships with independent
hardware and software vendors and system integrators to
encourage them to recommend or distribute our products. In
addition, an integral part of our strategy is to diversify our
base of channel relationships by adding more channel members
with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers. This will
require additional resources as we will need to expand our
internal sales and service coverage of these customers. If we
fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our
distribution channels, our business could be adversely affected.
In addition to this diversification of our base, we will need to
maintain a healthy mix of members who cater to smaller
customers. We could need to add and remove distribution members
to maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of
our products, which could increase our operating expenses. We
are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest,
significant resources to develop these channels, which could
reduce our profits.



If we do not generate sufficient cash flow
    from operations in the future, we may not be able to fund our
    operations and fulfill our future obligations.

Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations to fund our product development and offerings and
make payments on our debt and other obligations depends on a
range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of
which are outside our control. We cannot assure you that our
business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations,
that currently anticipated cost savings and operating
improvements will be realized on schedule or at all, or that we
will be able to liquidate our investments, sell assets or raise
equity when needed or desirable. In December 2000, we invested
$158.1 million in a trust managed by an investment advisor
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event that our
debentures are redeemed in March 2004. If the value of the
investments in the trust significantly decreases, the proceeds
of the trust combined with our other cash and investments may
not be sufficient to fund the redemption of our outstanding
debentures in 2004, if required. An inability to fund our
operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. For further information, please refer to
“Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

We rely on indirect distribution channels and
    major distributors that we do not control.

We rely significantly on independent distributors
and resellers to market and distribute our products. We do not
control our distributors and resellers. Additionally, our
distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products
and could also represent other lines of products. Some of our
distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged
products for resale to our smaller end-user customers. If
distributors and resellers reduce their inventory of our
packaged products, our business could be adversely affected. In
the quarter ended December 31, 2002, we believe that our
distributors and resellers held smaller inventories of packaged
products as compared to inventories they held in prior quarters.
Further, we could maintain individually significant accounts
receivable balances with certain distributors. For example, one
of our distributors accounted for approximately 7% of gross
accounts receivable as of December 31, 2002. As of
December 31, 2001, the same distributor accounted for 14%
of gross accounts receivable. The financial condition of our
distributors could deteriorate and distributors could
significantly delay or default on their payment obligations. Any
significant delays or defaults could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Our products could contain errors that could
    delay the release of new products and may not be detected until
    after our products are shipped.

Despite significant testing by us and by current
and potential customers, our products, especially new products
or releases, could contain errors. In some cases, these errors
may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been
made. Errors in our products could delay the development or
release of new products and could adversely affect market
acceptance of our products. Additionally, our products depend on
third party products, which could contain defects and could
reduce the performance of our products or render them useless.
Because our products are often used in mission-critical
applications, errors in our products or the products of third
parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty
or other claims by our customers.

Our research and development purchased in
    acquisitions is subject to certain risks.

In the past we have re-evaluated the amounts
charged to in-process research and development in connection
with acquisitions and licensing arrangements. The amount and
rate of amortization of those amounts are subject to a number of
risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties include the
effects of any changes in accounting standards or guidance
adopted by the SEC or the accounting profession. Any changes in
accounting standards or guidance adopted by the SEC could
materially adversely affect our future results of operations
through increased amortization expense. We cannot assure you
that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to
acquired in-process research and development will match the
projections we used to initially value in-process research and
development when we acquired it. Ongoing operations and



financial results for acquired assets and
licensed technology, and for our business as a whole, are
subject to a variety of risks, which we may not have known or
been able to estimate at the time of the transactions.

Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will
succeed in our efforts to integrate and further develop our
acquired technologies. In 1999 and 2001, we acquired certain
in-process software technologies from ViewSoft and Sequoia. We
are currently working on integrating some of the acquired
technologies into our anticipated future product offerings and
on associated design, development and rework required to
integrate the technologies. However, we cannot guarantee we will
be successful in our efforts to integrate and further develop
these technologies. If we fail to complete the development of
our anticipated future product offerings, or if we fail to
complete them in a timely manner, our financial condition and
results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We
cannot currently determine the impact those delays could have on
our business, future results of operations and financial
condition. We could incur additional charges in later periods to
reflect costs associated with completing those projects.

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may
    not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at
    the time of an acquisition.

Acquisitions of high-technology companies are
inherently risky. We cannot assure anyone that our previous
acquisitions, including the purchase of Sequoia, or any future
acquisitions will be successful. The risks we commonly encounter
are:

These factors could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We cannot guarantee that the combined company
resulting from any acquisition can continue to support the
growth achieved by the companies separately. We must also focus
on our ability to manage and integrate any acquisition. Our
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate
acquired companies could adversely affect our business and
operating results.

If we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough
    qualified employees, our ability to manage our business could be
    adversely affected.

Our success depends, in large part, upon the
services of a number of key employees. We do not have long-term
employment agreements with any of our key personnel. Any officer
or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any
time. The effective management of our growth, if any, could
depend upon our ability to retain our highly skilled technical,
managerial, finance and marketing personnel. If any of those
employees leave, we will need to attract and retain replacements
for them. We could also need to add key personnel in the future.
The market for these qualified employees is competitive. We
could find it difficult to successfully attract, assimilate or
retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Also, we could need to
hire additional personnel to develop new products, product
enhancements and technologies. If we cannot add the necessary
staff and resources, our ability to develop future enhancements
and features to our existing or future products could be
delayed. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.



If product returns or price adjustments exceed
    our reserves, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

We provide most of our distributors with product
return rights only for the purpose of stock balancing, which
generally permit our distributors to return products to us,
subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products. We
also provide price protection rights to most of our
distributors. Price protection rights require that we grant
retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products
held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products
within a specified time period. To cover our exposure to these
product returns and price adjustments, we establish reserves
based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current
marketing plans. However, we cannot assure you that our reserves
will be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price
adjustments. If we inadequately forecast reserves, our operating
results could be adversely affected.

Increased political and social turmoil could
    adversely impact our business.

Increasing political and social turmoil, such as
terrorist and military actions, can be expected to put further
pressure on economic conditions in the United States and foreign
jurisdictions. These conditions make it difficult for us, and
our customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business
activities and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our stock price could be volatile, and you
    could lose the value of your investment.

Our stock price has been volatile and has
fluctuated significantly to date. The trading price of our stock
is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide
fluctuations. Your investment in our stock could lose value.
Some of the factors that could significantly affect the market
price of our stock include:

The stock market in general, The Nasdaq National
Market and the market for software companies and technology
companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations. These broad market and industry factors
could materially and adversely affect the market price of our
stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

If we fail to manage our operations and
    control expenses effectively, our future operating results could
    be adversely affected.

Historically, the scope of our operations, the
number of our employees and the geographic area of our
operations have grown rapidly. In addition, we have acquired
both domestic and international companies. This growth and the
assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could
continue to place a significant strain on our managerial,
operational and financial resources. To manage our growth, if
any, effectively, we need to continue to implement and improve
additional management and financial systems and controls. We may
not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or
future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities
for our products and services in a timely and cost-effective
way. Our future operating results could also depend on our
ability to manage:

•

our expanding product line,

•

our marketing and sales organizations, and

•

our client support organization as installations
    of our products increase.



We took steps to reduce operating expenses
commencing in the fourth quarter of 2002, however our operating
expenses in 2003 could exceed our operating expenses in 2002. An
increase in operating expenses could reduce our income from
operations and cash flows from operating activities in the
future.

Our business and investments could be
    adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions.

General economic and market conditions, and other
factors outside our control, could adversely affect our business
and impair the value of our investments. Any further downturn in
general economic conditions could result in a reduction in
demand for our products and services and could harm our
business. In addition, an economic downturn could result in an
impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to
record losses related to such investments. An impairment in the
value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and
distract management. As of December 31, 2002, we had
$576.7 million of short and long-term investments with
various issuers and financial institutions. In many cases we do
not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these
investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of
these investments. Fluctuations in economic and market
conditions could adversely effect the value of our investments,
and we could lose some of our investment portfolio. A total loss
of an investment could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition. For further information on
these investments, please refer to “Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

Our revenue may not grow, and if we do not
    successfully manage our expenses, our business could be
    negatively impacted.

We attribute most of our growth during recent
years to the introduction of the MetaFrame software for Windows
operating systems in mid-1998. We cannot assure you that the
infrastructure software markets in which we operate, will grow.
We cannot assure that the release of our secure access
infrastructure software suite, including the MetaFrame Secure
Access Manager, or other new products will increase our revenue
growth rate.

In addition, to the extent our revenue grows, if
at all, we believe that our cost of revenues and certain
operating expenses could also increase. In the third quarter of
2002, we took actions to reduce operating expenses starting in
the fourth quarter of 2002. We cannot assure you that our
operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual
revenues in any given quarter. If we experience a shortfall in
revenue in any given quarter, we likely will not be able to
further reduce operating expenses quickly in response. Any
significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely
affect our results of operations for that quarter. Also, due to
the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current
expectation for revenue growth, our income from operations and
cash flows from operating and investing activities could be
lower than in recent years.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
    ABOUT MARKET RISK

The following discussion about our market risk
includes “forward-looking statements” that involve
risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The
analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed
below should not be considered projections of future events,
gains or losses.

We are exposed to financial market risks,
including changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition. To mitigate foreign currency
and interest rate risk, we utilize derivative financial
instruments. The counter-parties to our derivative instruments
are major financial institutions. All of the potential changes
noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our
financial position as of December 31, 2002. Actual results
could differ materially.

Discussions of our accounting policies for
derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes 2 and
13 to our consolidated financial statements.

Exposure
to Exchange Rates

A substantial majority of our overseas expense
and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local
currencies, primarily British pounds sterling, Euros, Swiss
francs, Japanese yen and Australian dollars. To reduce exposure
to reduction in U.S. dollar value and the volatility of future
cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have
established a hedging program. We use foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
expenditures. Our hedging program significantly reduces, but
does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange
rate movements.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had in
place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional
amount of $48.9 million and $13.1 million,
respectively, and foreign currency forward purchase contracts
with a notional amount of $128.4 million and
$60.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2002 and
2001, these contracts had an aggregate fair value of
$3.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Based on a
hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from
December 31, 2002 market rates the fair value of our
foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by
$8.3 million. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% depreciation
of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2002 market rates
would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward
contracts by $8.3 million. Foreign operating costs in these
hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction.
This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to
the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified
above, changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar
value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors
products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity
analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates does not factor in a potential change in levels of local
currency prices or sales reported in U.S. dollars. We do not
anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a
result of these forward foreign exchange contracts.

Exposure
to Interest Rates

In order to better manage our exposure to
interest rate risk, in December 2002 we entered into 12 interest
rate swap agreements. The swap agreements, with an aggregate
notional amount of $208.0 million convert the fixed rate
return on 12 of our available-for-sale securities, to a floating
rate. The aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps at
December 31, 2002 was a liability of $3.4 million.
Based upon a hypothetical 1% increase in the market interest
rate as of December 31, 2002, the fair value of these
aggregated liabilities would have decreased by approximately
$8.2 million. Based on a hypothetical 1% decrease in the
market interest rate as of December 31, 2002, the fair
value of these aggregated liabilities would have increased by
approximately $8.4 million. The underlying assets would
experience offsetting gains and losses. We also maintain
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments in debt
securities, which limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one issue, issuer, or type of instrument. The securities in our
investment portfolio are not leveraged. The securities
classified as available-for-sale are subject to interest rate
risk. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair
values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market
interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include
principal plus accrued interest, dividends and reinvestment
income. If



market interest rates were to increase by 100
basis points from December 31, 2002 and 2001 levels, the
fair value of the available-for-sale portfolio would decline by
approximately $0.6 million and $1.1 million,
respectively. This sensitivity analysis on our
available-for-sale portfolio excludes the underlying investments
to our 12 interest rate swaps discussed above, as the interest
rate risk related to those investments has been effectively
hedged. For more information see note 13 to our consolidated
financial statements.

These amounts are determined by considering the
impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our interest rate
swap agreements and its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
investment portfolios. This analysis does not consider the
effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of
overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.

In April 2002, we entered into a synthetic lease
with a substantive lessor totaling approximately
$61 million related to office space utilized for our
corporate headquarters. Payments under this synthetic lease are
indexed to a variable interest rate (LIBOR plus a margin). Based
upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at
December 31, 2002, a 100 basis point change in the current
interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial
position and results of operations. In addition to interest rate
exposure, if the fair value of our headquarters building in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida were to significantly decline, there could
be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Citrix Systems, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Citrix Systems, Inc. as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Citrix Systems, Inc. at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
certain intangible assets as a result of adopting Statement of

1.     ORGANIZATION

Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix” or the
“Company”), a Delaware corporation founded on
April 17, 1989, is a leading supplier of corporate
application and information access infrastructure software and
services that enable the effective and efficient enterprise-wide
deployment and management of applications and information,
including those designed for Microsoft® Windows®
operating systems, for UNIX® operating systems, such as Sun
Solaris

TM

, HP-UX, or IBM®-AIX®
(collectively, “UNIX operating systems”) and for
Web-based information systems. The Company’s
MetaFrame® products permit organizations to provide secure
access to Windows based, Web-based and UNIX applications without
regard to location, network connection or type of client
hardware platforms. The Company markets and licenses its
products through multiple channels such as value-added
resellers, distributors, system integrators and independent
software vendors, managed by the Company’s worldwide sales
force.

2.     SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation Policy

The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in
the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. All significant
transactions and balances between the Company and its
subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents at December 31,
2002 include marketable securities, which are primarily
municipal securities, money market funds, corporate securities
and commercial paper with initial or remaining contractual
maturities when purchased of three months or less. The Company
minimizes its credit risk associated with cash and cash
equivalents by investing primarily in investment grade, highly
liquid instruments and periodically evaluating the credit
quality of its primary financial institutions.

Investments

Short and long-term investments at
December 31, 2002 primarily consist of corporate
securities, government securities and municipal securities.
Investments classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Investments
classified as held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost. The
Company does not recognize changes in the fair value of certain
investments in income unless a decline in value is considered
other-than-temporary.

From time to time, the Company makes equity
investments that are accounted for under the cost method due to
the limited extent of the Company’s ownership interest and
the lack of the Company’s ability to exert significant
influence over the investees. As of December 31, 2002 and
2001, such investments were recorded at the lower of cost or
estimated net realizable value. The Company periodically
evaluates the carrying value of its investments to determine if
there has been any impairment of value that is
other-than-temporary. During 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded
$2.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of losses
resulting from sales of available-for-sale securities and
other-than-temporary declines in fair value of certain of the
Company’s investments. Amounts included in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in prior periods are
reclassified to earnings using the specific identification
method. At December 31, 2002, the Company’s remaining
equity investments were approximately $0.2 million.

The Company minimizes its credit risk associated
with investments by investing primarily in investment grade,
highly liquid securities. The Company maintains investments with
various financial institutions and the Company’s policy is
designed to limit exposure to any one institution depending on
credit quality. Periodic

F-7


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

evaluations of the relative credit standing of
those financial institutions are considered in the
Company’s investment strategy.

At December 31, 2002, approximately
$63 million in investment securities were pledged as
collateral for specified obligations under the Company’s
synthetic lease. In addition, at December 31, 2002,
approximately $109 million in investment securities were
pledged as collateral for the Company’s credit default
contracts. The Company maintains the ability to manage the
composition of the pledged investments. Accordingly, these
securities are not reflected as restricted investments in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For further
information see Notes 10 and 13.

The Company relies on third party valuations to
adjust the carrying value of certain of its investments and
derivative instruments to fair value at the end of each period.
Fair values are based on valuation models that use market quotes
and, for certain investments, assumptions as to the
creditworthiness of the entities issuing those underlying
investments.

Accounts Receivable

Substantially all of the Company’s accounts
receivable are due from value-added resellers and distributors
of computer software. Collateral is not required. Credit losses
and expected product returns are provided for in the
consolidated financial statements and have been within
management’s expectations. If the financial condition of a
significant distributor or customer were to deteriorate, the
Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.
One distributor accounted for approximately 7% and 14% of gross
accounts receivable at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. No other distributor or customer accounted for
more than 10% of gross accounts receivable.

Inventories

Inventories, consisting primarily of raw
materials, are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the
first-in, first-out method) or market. When necessary, a
provision has been made to reduce obsolete or excess inventories
to market.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three
years for computer equipment, software, office equipment and
furniture, the lesser of the lease term or five years for
leasehold improvements, seven years for the enterprise resource
planning system and 40 years for buildings. Assets under capital
leases are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the
remaining lease term. Amortization of assets under capital
leases is included in depreciation expense. Accumulated
amortization of equipment under capital leases approximated
$0.4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

F-8


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

Property and equipment consist of the following:

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and
used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment
loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the
fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
During 2002, the Company recognized $2.0 million in asset
impairment charges primarily due to the consolidation of certain
of its offices resulting in the abandonment of certain leasehold
improvements. These charges are reflected in operating expenses
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and
primarily related to the Americas geographic segment. As of
December 31, 2002, we have determined that there were no
other triggering events requiring additional impairment analysis.

Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
    Use

The Company accounts for internal use software
pursuant to Statement of Position No. (“SOP”) 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use

. Pursuant to the SOP, the Company
capitalizes external direct costs of materials and services used
in the project and internal costs such as payroll and benefits
of those employees directly associated with the development of
the software. The amount of costs capitalized in 2002 and 2001
relating to internal use software were $3.4 million and
$16.7 million, respectively, consisting principally of
purchased software and services provided by external vendors.
These costs are being amortized over the estimated useful life
of the software developed, which is generally three to seven
years and are included in property and equipment in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Software Development Costs

Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(“SFAS”) No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,

requires certain software development costs to be capitalized
upon the establishment of technological feasibility. The
establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing
assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires
considerable judgment by manage-

CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

ment with respect to certain external factors
such as anticipated future revenue, estimated economic life, and
changes in software and hardware technologies. Software
development costs incurred beyond the establishment of
technological feasibility have not been significant.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the
Company’s goodwill and certain intangible assets are no
longer amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test.
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased
amortizing goodwill with a net book value at January 1,
2002 of $152.4 million, including $10.1 million of acquired
workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets.
There was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets
as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142 or the annual
impairment completed during the fourth quarter of 2002.
Excluding goodwill, the Company has no intangible assets deemed
to have indefinite lives. Substantially all of the
Company’s goodwill at December 31, 2002 was associated
with the Americas reportable segment. See Note 12 for segment
information.

The following table provides a reconciliation of
reported net income for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000 to net income adjusted as if SFAS No. 142 had been
applied as of the beginning of 2000. Some amounts may not add
due to rounding.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are recorded at cost, less
accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three
to five years, except for patents, which are amortized over
10 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, the Company
carries core and product technology at net realizable value and
reviews this technology for impairment on a periodic basis by
comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized
cost of the technology. There has been no impairment of these
assets to date.

Intangible assets consist of the following (in
thousands):

Revenue Recognition

The Company markets and licenses software
products through value-added resellers, channel distributors,
system integrators and independent software vendors, managed by
the Company’s worldwide sales force. The Company’s
software licenses are generally perpetual, and are delivered by
means of traditional packaged products and electronically,
typically under volume-based licensing programs. The
Company’s packaged products are typically purchased by
medium and small-sized businesses with fewer locations and the
software license is delivered with the packaged product.

Volume-based license arrangements are used with
more complex multi-server environments typically found in larger
business enterprises that deploy the Company’s products on
a department or enterprise-wide basis, which could require
differences in product features and functionality at various
customer locations. The end-customer license agreement with
enterprise customers is typically customized based on these
factors. Once the Company receives a purchase order from the
channel distributor, the volume-based licenses are
electronically delivered to the customer with “software
activation keys” that enable the feature configuration
ordered by the end-customer. Depending on the size of the
enterprise, software may be delivered indirectly by the channel
distributor or directly by the Company pursuant to a purchase
order from the channel distributor.

Revenue is recognized when it is earned. The
Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance
with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2 (as amended by
SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9) and related interpretations,

Software Revenue Recognition

. The Company recognizes
revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of the arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and
the Company has no remaining obligations; the fee is fixed or
determinable; and collectibility is probable. The Company
defines these four criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists.
    The Company recognizes revenue on packaged product upon shipment
    to distributors and resellers. For packaged product sales, it is
    the Company’s customary practice to require a purchase
    order from distributors who have previously negotiated a master
    packaged product distribution or resale agreement. For
    volume-based licensing, the Company typically requires a
    purchase order from the distributor or reseller and an executed
    standard software license agreement from the end-customer. The
    Company requires a purchase order for training and services.

F-11


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Delivery has occurred and the Company has no
    remaining obligations. The Company’s standard delivery
    method is free-on-board shipping point. Consequently, it
    considers delivery of packaged product to have occurred when the
    products are shipped to distributors pursuant to an agreement
    and purchase order. The Company considers delivery of licenses
    under electronic licensing agreements to have occurred when the
    related products are shipped and the end-customer has been
    electronically provided with the licenses that include the
    activation keys that allow the end-customer to take immediate
    possession of the software. For training and service revenue
    recognition, the Company fulfills its obligation when the
    services are performed.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable. In the normal
    course of business, the Company does not provide end-customers
    the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees or
    extended payment terms. When the Company sells its software
    products separately, vendor specific objective evidence
    (“VSOE”) is determined by the price charged for each
    product. In software arrangements that include the rights to
    multiple software products, post-contract customer support
    (“PCS”) and/or other services, the Company allocates
    the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the
    relative fair value of each of the deliverables based on VSOE.
    If management cannot objectively determine the fair value of
    each undelivered element based on VSOE, revenue recognition is
    deferred until all elements are delivered, all services have
    been performed, or until fair value can be objectively
    determined.

•

Collectibility is probable. The Company
    determines collectibility on a customer-by-customer basis. The
    Company typically sells to distributors or resellers for whom
    there are histories of successful collection. New customers are
    subject to a credit review process that evaluates the
    customers’ financial position and ultimately their ability
    to pay. Customers are subject to an ongoing credit review
    process. If the Company determines from the outset of an
    arrangement that collectibility is not probable, revenue
    recognition is deferred until customer payment is received and
    the other parameters of revenue recognition described above have
    been achieved. Management’s judgment is required in
    assessing the probability of collection, which is generally
    based on evaluation of customer specific information, historical
    experience and economic market conditions. If market conditions
    decline, or, if the financial condition of distributors or
    end-customers deteriorates, the Company may be unable to
    determine that collectibility is probable, and it could be
    required to defer the recognition of revenues until the Company
    receives customer payment.

For certain software products that are only sold
bundled with PCS, the Company allocates revenue to the delivered
software product using the residual method. Under the residual
method, the Company does not sell the software products
separately and thus is generally unable to determine VSOE of
fair value for the product. Therefore, the Company allocates
discounts inherent in the arrangement entirely to the software
product and the portion of the fee initially allocated to PCS
and deferred is generally higher than in arrangements with
established VSOE for the software product. Depending on future
product releases or changes in customer demand, the Company may
offer additional products that are only sold bundled with PCS.
If the Company does this, the use of the residual method will
become more prevalent, which could impact the timing of revenue
recognition since more of the sales proceeds would be allocated
to the PCS portion of the arrangement and recognized over the
PCS period. The Company also sells PCS separately through the
Subscription Advantage renewal program, and it determines VSOE
by the renewal price charged. The Company bases technical
service and PCS revenues from customer maintenance fees for
ongoing customer support and product updates and upgrades on the
price charged or derived value of the undelivered elements and
are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is
typically 12 to 24 months. The Company includes technical
service revenues in net revenues in the consolidated statements
of income.

In the normal course of business, the Company
does not permit product returns, but it does provide most of its
distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and
price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit
distributors to return products to the Company, subject to
ordering an equal dollar amount of products.

F-12


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Price protection rights require that the Company
grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of its
products held by distributors or resellers if it lowers prices
for such products. The Company establishes provisions for
estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection
rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the
recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based
upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among
other things, historical return rates for both specific products
and distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by
product, the impact of any new product releases and projected
economic conditions. Actual product returns for stock balancing
and price protection provisions incurred are, however, dependent
upon future events, including the amount of stock balancing
activity by distributors and the level of distributor
inventories at the time of any price adjustments. The Company
continually monitors the factors that influence the pricing of
its products and distributor inventory levels and makes
adjustments to these provisions when it believes actual returns
and other allowances could differ from established reserves. The
Company’s ability to recognize revenues upon shipment to
distributors is predicated on its ability to reliably estimate
future product returns and rotation. If actual return experience
or changes in market condition impairs the Company’s
ability to estimate returns and rotation, it would be required
to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the
product to the end-user customer. Allowances for estimated
product returns amounted to approximately $10.5 million at
December 31, 2002 and $8.3 million at
December 31, 2001. The Company has not reduced and has no
current plans to reduce its prices for inventory currently held
by distributors or resellers. Accordingly, there were no
reserves required for price protection at December 31, 2002
or 2001. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for
customer programs and incentive offerings including volume-based
incentives. If market conditions were to decline, the Company
could take actions to increase its customer incentive offerings
and possibly result in an incremental reduction to its revenue
at the time the incentive is offered.

The Company provides consulting services to
certain license customers. The services consist of network
configuration and optimization and are typically performed prior
to the customers’ purchase and implementation of the
Company’s software products. Services are not essential to
the functionality of the Company’s software and do not
constitute modifications to the Company’s software. Revenue
from services, support arrangements and training programs and
materials, which totaled $44.5 million, $40.7 million
and $30.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, is recognized when the
services are provided and the other criteria of revenue
recognition have been met. Such items are included in net
revenues. The costs for providing consulting services are
included in cost of sales. The costs of providing training and
services are included in sales, marketing and support expenses.

In May 1997, the Company entered into a five year
joint license, development and marketing agreement with
Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) (as amended, the
“Microsoft Development Agreement”), pursuant to which
the Company licensed its multi-user Windows NT extensions to
Microsoft for inclusion in certain versions of Windows NT server
software. Revenue from the Microsoft Development Agreement was
recognized ratably over the five-year term of the contract,
which expired in May 2002. Revenues recognized pursuant to the
Microsoft Development Agreement are included in other revenues
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Product Concentration

The Company derives a substantial portion of its
revenues from one software product and anticipates that this
product and future derivative products and product lines based
upon this technology, if any, will constitute a majority of its
revenue for the foreseeable future. The Company could experience
declines in demand for products, whether as a result of general
economic conditions, new competitive product releases, price
competition, lack of success of its strategic partners,
technological change or other factors.

F-13


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues consist primarily of
compensation and other personnel-related costs of providing
consulting services, as well as, the cost of royalties, product
media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials and shipping
expense. The Company is a party to licensing agreements with
various entities, which give the Company the right to use
certain software code in its products or in the development of
future products in exchange for the payment of a fixed fee or
certain amounts based upon the sales of the related product. The
licensing agreements generally have terms ranging from one to
five years, and generally include renewal options. However, some
agreements may be perpetual unless expressly terminated.
Royalties and other costs related to these agreements are
included in cost of revenues. All development costs incurred in
connection with the Microsoft Development Agreement, were
expensed as incurred as cost of other revenues. The
Company’s cost of revenues excludes amortization of
acquired core and product technologies, which is included in
amortization of intangible assets in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of each of the
Company’s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S.
dollar. Assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are
remeasured into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are remeasured at average rates prevailing
during the year. Remeasurement and foreign currency transaction
losses of approximately $1.1 million, $2.4 million and
$0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively, are included in other expense, net
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

In accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

and its related interpretations and amendments, the Company
records derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value.
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, if any, are
adjusted to fair value through earnings as other income
(expense) in the current period. For derivatives that are
designated as and qualify as effective cash flow hedges, the
portion of gain or loss on the derivative instrument effective
at offsetting changes in the hedged item is reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and reclassified into earnings as operating income
(expense) when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For
derivative instruments that are designated as and qualify as
effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current
earnings as interest income (expense) during the period of
the change in fair values. The application of the provisions of
SFAS No. 133 could impact the volatility of earnings.

The Company formally documents all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions. This process includes attributing all
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to floating
rate assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and
attributing all derivatives that are designated as fair value
hedges to fixed rate assets or liabilities. The Company also
formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an
ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged
item. Fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments
are generally offset by changes in the hedged item; however, if
it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge,
the Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for
the affected derivative.

F-14


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

Advertising Expense

The Company expenses advertising costs as
incurred. The Company has cooperative advertising agreements
with certain distributors and resellers whereby the Company will
reimburse distributors and resellers for qualified advertising
of Citrix products. Reimbursement is made once the distributor
or reseller provides substantiation of qualified expenditures.
The Company estimates the impact of this program and recognizes
it at the time of product sale as a component of sales,
marketing and support expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. The Company recognized advertising
expenses of approximately $10.0 million, $11.1 million
and $10.7 million, during the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company is required to estimate income taxes
in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of the
process of preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based
upon differences between the financial statement and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The realization of deferred tax assets is based on
historical tax positions and expectations about future taxable
income. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred
tax assets if their realization does not meet the “not more
likely than not” criteria of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Except for amounts
previously provided for in the consolidated financial
statements, earnings of overseas subsidiaries are considered
permanently reinvested.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant
estimates made by management include the provision for doubtful
accounts receivables, provision for sales returns and stock
rotation, valuation of the Company’s goodwill and acquired
workforce, net realizable value of core and product technology
and the amortization and depreciation periods for intangible and
long-lived assets. While the Company believes that such
estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with the
consolidated financial position and results of operations taken
as a whole, the actual amounts of such estimates, when known,
will vary from these estimates.

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,

defines a fair value method of accounting for
issuance of stock options and other equity instruments. Under
the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the
grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting
period. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, companies are not
required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for
employee stock-based transactions. Companies are permitted to
account for such transactions under Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,

but are required to disclose in a note
to the consolidated financial statements pro forma net income
and per share amounts as if a company had applied the methods
prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for its plans, stock
options granted to employees and non-employee directors and has
complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123.
Except for non-employee directors, the Company has not granted
any options to non-employees. See Note 6 for more

3.     ACQUISITIONS

In April 2001, the Company completed the
acquisition of Sequoia Software Corporation
(“Sequoia”) for approximately $182.6 million. A
portion of the purchase price was allocated to in-process
research and development (“IPR&D”), which the
Company concluded had not reached technological feasibility and
for which there was no alternative future use after taking into
consideration the potential use of technologies in different
products, the stage of development and life cycle of each
project, resale of the software and internal use. The value of
the respective purchased IPR&D was expensed at the time of
the transaction and resulted in a pre-tax charge to the
Company’s operations of approximately $2.6 million in
2001.

In February 2000, the Company acquired all of the
operating assets of the Innovex Group, Inc.
(“Innovex”) for approximately $47.8 million. At
the date of acquisition, the Company paid approximately
$28.7 million in consideration and $0.2 million in
transaction costs, respectively. Pursuant to the acquisition
agreement, the remaining purchase consideration, plus interest,
was contingently payable based on future events. During 2001,
these contingencies were met, resulting in approximately
$16.2 million of additional purchase price and
$2.9 million in compensation to the former owners. Pursuant
to the acquisition agreement, payment of $10.5 million of
the contingent amounts and associated interest was made in
August 2001 and $10.7 million was paid in 2002. There are
no remaining contingent obligations.

Each acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. The consolidated financial
statements reflect the operations of the acquired businesses for
the periods after their respective dates of acquisition. The
purchase consideration was allocated to the acquired assets and
liabilities based on fair values as follows:

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
did not believe that there were sufficient projected cash flows
or alternative future uses to support the net book value of core
technology associated with certain acquisitions made prior to
2000. As a result, the Company wrote off $9.1 million of
certain core technology as of December 31, 2000.

4.     CASH AND
INVESTMENTS

The summary of the Company’s cash and cash
equivalents and investments consists of the following:

The unrealized gain (loss) associated with
each individual category of cash and investments was not
significant for either of the periods presented.

In December 2000, the Company invested
$158.1 million in a trust managed by an investment advisor.
The purpose of the trust is to maintain sufficient liquidity in
the event that the Company’s debentures are redeemed in
March 2004. The Company’s investment in the trust matures
on March 22, 2004, and comprises all of the trust’s
assets. The trust’s assets primarily consist of AAA-rated
zero-coupon corporate securities. The trust entered into a
credit risk swap agreement with the investment advisor, which
effectively increased the yield on the trust’s assets and
for which value the trust assumed the credit risk of ten
investment-grade companies. The effective yield of the trust,
including the credit risk swap agreement, is 6.72% and the
principal balance will accrete to $195 million in March
2004. The Company records its investment in the trust and the
underlying investments and swap as held-to-maturity zero-coupon
corporate security in its consolidated financial statements. The
Company does not recognize changes in the fair value of the
held-to-maturity investment unless a decline in the fair value
of the trust is other-than-temporary, in which case the Company
would recognize a loss in earnings. The Company’s
investment is at risk to the extent that one of the underlying
corporate securities has a credit event resulting in non-payment
to the counterparty that may include bankruptcy, dissolution, or
insolvency of the issuers. There have been no losses associated
with the trust’s underlying corporate securities to date.
The amortized cost of the Company’s investment in the trust
was approximately $180.4 million at December 31, 2002
and $169.0 million at December 31, 2001, which was

F-17


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

classified as long-term corporate investments in
our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2002, the
fair value of the trust’s assets was $180.2 million.

Other than the Trust investments described above,
the Company’s short and long-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.
Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of
securities and other-than-temporary write downs of investments
classified as available-for-sale, using the specific
identification method, were $0.7 million and
$2.8 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2002 and $8.1 million and
$7.7 million respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, the average
original contractual maturity of the Company’s short-term
available-for-sale investments was approximately 17 months.
The Company’s long-term available-for-sale investments at
December 31, 2002 include $297.2 million of
investments with original contractual maturities ranging from
one to five years, $20.5 million of investments with
original contractual maturities ranging from five to
10 years and $1.1 million of investments with
contractual maturities of 35 years. The average remaining
maturities of the Company’s short and long-term
available-for-sale investments at December 31, 2002 was
four and 42 months, respectively. The Company also owns
$0.2 million in equity investments not due at a single
maturity date classified as long-term investments.

During 2002 the Company invested in two
instruments with an aggregate amount of $38 million that
include structured credit risk features whereby the
Company’s investment is at risk to the extent that several
of the underlying corporate securities, above specified
threshold amounts, have credit events that result in a loss to
the counterparty that may include bankruptcy, dissolution or
insolvency of the issuers. The risk level of these instruments
is equivalent to an “AA” single security. There have
been no credit events associated with the underlying corporate
securities to date. If, in the future, one of these instruments
has credit events, which would accrue to the Company, the
Company’s investment will be reduced to fund the loss, not
to exceed the principal value of the investment.

The change in net unrealized securities gains
(losses) recognized in other comprehensive income includes
unrealized gains (losses) that arose from changes in market
value of securities that were held during the period and gains
(losses) that were previously unrealized, but have been
recognized in current period net income due to sales of
available-for-sale securities. This reclassification has no
effect on total comprehensive income or stockholders’
equity and was immaterial for all periods presented.

In connection with the Company’s efforts to
manage the credit quality and maturities of its investment
portfolio, during 2001 the Company sold corporate debt
securities with an accreted value of $165.5 million that
were previously designated as held-to-maturity and purchased
higher credit quality corporate debt securities with interest
rates that reset quarterly. Additionally, during 2001, the
Company terminated a forward bond purchase agreement previously
designated as a hedge of forecasted purchases of corporate
security investments. The sale of securities and the termination
of the forward bond purchase agreement resulted in a realized
gain of approximately $8.0 million, which is included in
other expense, net in the 2001 consolidated statement of income.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of
the following:

6.     EMPLOYEE STOCK
COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS

Stock Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2002, the Company has
five stock-based compensation plans, which are described below.
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to
employees with an exercise price equal to or above the fair
value of the shares at the date of grant. As mentioned in
Note 2, the Company applies the intrinsic value method
under APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for its fixed stock plans and its stock purchase
plan. However, the impact on the Company’s financial
statements from the use of options is reflected in the
calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution (see
Note 14).

The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion
No. 25 because the alternative fair value accounting
provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option
valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, that were
developed for use with traded options which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable, as opposed to employee
stock options, which are typically non-transferable and last up
to ten years. Currently, management believes there is not one
agreed upon option valuation method that is comparable among all
reporting companies. Specifically, the Black-Scholes model
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
assumptions related to the expected stock price volatility over
the expected life of the option. Because the Company’s
stock-based awards to employees have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion,
the existing pricing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock-based
awards to employees. Since the Black-Scholes model is based on
statistical expectations, the calculation can result in
substantial earnings volatility that may not agree, as to timing
or amount, with the actual gain or loss accrued or realized by
the option holder.

Had compensation cost for the Company’s five
stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for grants under those plans consistent
with the method of SFAS No. 123,

F-19


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company’s cash flows would have remained
unchanged, however net income and earnings per share would have
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

For purposes of the pro forma calculations, the
fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, assuming no
expected dividends and the following assumptions:

Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a
stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected life of
the option. Much of the value of a stock option is derived from
its potential for appreciation. This potential is reflected in
the volatility of the underlying stock, which can be measured by
periodic changes in the historical stock price. The higher the
volatility, the higher the fair value of the option.

The risk-free interest rate represents the
current rate associated with zero coupon U.S. Government
securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life of
the options being valued. The risk-free interest rate is used in
determining the stock’s forward value, and only modestly
impacts the fair value of the option. The higher the risk-free
interest rate, the higher the fair value of the option.

The expected life of the option is a measure of
the amount of time it is expected to take for an employee to
exercise their option. Estimating expected lives involves
consideration of several factors, including the characteristics
of employees receiving the option awards, the vesting period of
the awards, historical exercise patterns of employees, and the
expected volatility of the underlying stock. The longer the
expected life, the more time the option holder has available to
allow the stock price to increase, and thus the higher the
option’s fair value.

The determination of the fair value of all
options is based on the assumptions described in the preceding
paragraphs, and because additional option grants are expected to
be made each year and forfeitures will occur when employees
leave the Company, the above pro forma disclosures are not
representative of pro forma effects on reported net income
(loss) for future years.

Fixed Stock Option Plans

The Company’s amended and restated 1995
Stock Plan (the “1995 Plan”) was originally adopted by
the Board on September 28, 1995 and approved by the
Company’s stockholders in October 1995. Under the
terms of the 1995 Plan the Company is authorized to grant
incentive stock options (“ISOs”) and nonqualified
stock options (“NSOs”), make stock awards and provide
the opportunity to purchase stock to employees, directors and
officers and consultants of the Company. The 1995 Plan, as
amended, provides for the issuance of a maximum of 69,945,623
(as adjusted for stock splits) shares of Common Stock, plus,
effective January 1, 2001 and each year thereafter, a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to 5% of the total number
of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
December 31 of the preceding year. Under the 1995 Plan, a
maximum of 60,000,000 ISOs may be granted and ISOs must be
granted at exercise prices no less than market value at the date
of grant, except for ISOs granted to employees who own more than
10% of the Company’s combined voting power, for which the
exercise prices will be no less than 110% of the market value at
the date of grant. NSOs, stock awards or stock purchases may be
granted or authorized, as applicable, at prices no less than the
minimum legal consideration required. Under the 1995 Plan, as
amended, ISOs must be granted at exercise prices no less than
market value at the date of grant, provided however, that if an
NSO is expressly granted in lieu of a reasonable amount of
salary or cash bonus, the exercise price may be equal to or
greater than 85% of the fair market value at the date of such
grant. ISOs and NSOs expire ten years from the date of grant.
All options are exercisable upon vesting. The options typically
vest over four years at a rate of 25% of the shares underlying
the option one year from the date of grant and at a rate of
2.08% monthly thereafter.

The Company’s amended and restated 2000
Director and Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the
“2000 Plan”) was originally adopted by the Board of
Directors and approved by the Company’s stockholders on
May 18, 2000. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, the Company
is authorized to make stock awards, provide eligible individuals
with the opportunity to purchase stock, grant ISOs and grant
NSOs to officers and directors of the Company. The 2000 Plan
provides for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares, plus,
effective on January 1, 2001, on January 1 of each
year, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to one-half of
one percent (0.5%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of December 31 of the preceding
year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no more than 3,000,000
shares of Common Stock may be issued pursuant to the exercise of
incentive stock options granted under the 2000 Plan. Under the
2000 Plan, ISOs must be granted at exercise prices no less than
market value at the date of grant, provided however, that if an
NSO is expressly granted in lieu of a reasonable amount of
salary or cash bonus, the exercise price may be equal to or
greater than 85% of the fair market value at the date of such
grant. ISOs and NSOs expire ten years from date of grant. All
options are exercisable upon vesting. The options typically vest
over four years at a rate of 25% of the shares underlying the
option one year from date of grant and at a rate of 2.08%
monthly thereafter.

The amended and restated 1995 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan (the “Director Option
Plan”) was adopted by the Board of Directors on
September 28, 1995 and approved by the Company’s
stockholders in October 1995. The Director Option Plan
provides for the grant of options to purchase a maximum of
3,600,000 (as adjusted for stock splits) shares of Common Stock
of the Company to non-employee directors of the Company.

Under the current terms of the Director Option
Plan, each director who is not also an employee of the Company
and who is first elected as a director will receive, upon the
date of his or her initial election, an option to purchase
60,000 shares of Common Stock. Such options will vest at a rate
of 33.33% per year from the date of the grant for the first year
and vest at a rate of 2.78% monthly thereafter. In addition, in
the calendar year following a director’s first election to
the Board of Directors, on the first business day of the month
following the Annual Stockholders’ meeting, such director
would receive an additional option to purchase 20,000 shares of
Common Stock, which shall vest at a rate of 8.33% per month,
provided such

director continues to serve on the Board of
Directors at the time of grant. All options granted under the
Director Option Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and a term
of ten years from the date of grant. Options are exercisable to
the extent vested only while the optionee is serving as a
director of the Company or within 90 days after the
optionee ceases to serve as a director of the Company.

The Company’s 1989 Stock Option Plan (the
“1989 Plan”) as amended, permitted the Company to
grant ISOs and NSOs to purchase up to 25,256,544 (as adjusted
for stock splits) shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
Under the 1989 Plan, options may be granted at exercise prices
no less than market value at the date of grant. All options are
fully exercisable from the date of grant and are subject to a
repurchase option in favor of the Company which lapses as to
25.00% of the shares underlying the option one year from the
date of grant and as to 2.08% monthly thereafter. If the
purchaser of stock pursuant to the 1989 Plan is terminated from
employment with the Company, the Company has the right and
option to purchase from the employee, at the price paid for the
shares by the employee, the number of unvested shares at the
date of termination. No shares have been repurchased under this
Plan. Effective November 1999 no further options may be granted
under this Plan.

Stock Purchase Plan

The amended and restated 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “1995 Purchase Plan”) was
originally adopted by the Board of Directors on
September 28, 1995 and approved by the Company’s
stockholders in October 1995. The 1995 Purchase Plan provides
for the issuance of a maximum of 9,000,000 shares of Common
Stock upon the exercise of nontransferable options granted to
participating employees. All U.S.-based employees of the
Company, whose customary employment is 20 hours or more per
week and more than five months in any calendar year, and
employees of certain international subsidiaries, are eligible to
participate in the 1995 Purchase Plan. Employees who would
immediately after the grant own 5% or more of the Company’s
Common Stock, and directors who are not employees of the
Company, may not participate in the 1995 Purchase Plan. To
participate in the 1995 Purchase Plan, an employee must
authorize the Company to deduct an amount (not less than 1% nor
more than 10% of a participant’s total cash compensation to
a maximum of $25,000) from his or her pay during six-month
periods (each a Plan Period).

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock an
employee may purchase in any Plan Period is 6,000 shares subject
to certain other limitations. The exercise price for the option
for each Plan Period is 85% of the lesser of the market price of
the Common Stock on the first or last business day of the Plan
Period. If an employee is not a participant on the last day of
the Plan Period, such employee is not entitled to exercise his
or her option, and the amount of his or her accumulated payroll
deductions are refunded. An employee’s rights under the
1995 Purchase Plan terminate upon his or her voluntary
withdrawal from the 1995 Purchase Plan at any time or upon
termination of employment. Under the 1995 Purchase Plan, the
Company issued 248,027 shares, 213,907 shares and
77,781 shares in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Benefit Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) benefit plan (the
“Plan”) allowing eligible U.S.-based employees to
contribute up to 15% of their annual compensation, limited to an
annual maximum amount as set periodically by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Company, at its discretion, may contribute
up to $0.50 on each dollar of employee contribution, limited to
a maximum of 6% of the employee’s annual contribution. The
Company’s matching contributions for 2002, 2001 and 2000
were $2.0 million, $1.8 million and $1.2 million,
respectively. The Company’s contributions vest over a
four-year period at 25% per year.

STOCK

Common Stock

The Company has reserved for future issuance
71,221,641 shares of Common Stock for the exercise of stock
options outstanding or available for grant and
10,880,486 shares for the conversion of the zero coupon
convertible debentures into Common Stock.

On May 18, 2000, the stockholders approved
an increase of authorized Common Stock from
400,000,000 shares, $0.001 par value per share to
1,000,000,000 shares, $0.001 par value per share.

Stock Repurchase Programs

The Company’s Board of Directors has
authorized $600 million of repurchase authority under the
Company’s stock repurchase program, the objective of which
is to manage actual and anticipated dilution. All shares
repurchased are recorded as treasury stock.

The Company is authorized to make open market
purchases paid out of general corporate funds. During the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company purchased
9,300,000 and 3,135,500 shares, respectively of outstanding
Common Stock on the open market for approximately
$75.7 million and $90.7 million (at an average per
share price of $8.14 and $28.92), respectively.

From time to time, the Company enters into
arrangements with financial institutions as part of the share
repurchase program in order to lower the Company’s average
cost to acquire shares. These arrangements are described below.

The Company was a party to two agreements,
executed during 2001 and 2000, with a large financial
institution, to purchase approximately 7.3 million shares
of the Company’s Common Stock at various times in private
transactions. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, an
aggregate of $150 million was paid to this institution,
with the ultimate number of shares repurchased dependent on
market conditions. In May 2002, the agreements were terminated
and, upon termination, the Company received 3.0 million of
the remaining shares. The Company received a total of
7,209,286 shares pursuant to these agreements. During 2002,
the Company entered into a new agreement, as amended, with this
financial institution in a private transaction to purchase up to
3.8 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock at
various times through February 2003. Pursuant to the terms of
the agreement, $25 million was paid to this institution
during the third quarter of 2002. During 2002, the Company
received 2,655,469 shares under this agreement with a total
value of $18.5 million. The agreement matured in February
2003 and the Company received 390,830 of the remaining shares
with a total value of $6.5 million.

During 2002, the Company entered into two private
structured stock repurchase transactions with a large financial
institution. Under the terms of the first agreement and in
exchange for an up front payment of $25 million, the
Company was entitled to receive shares of its Common Stock or a
predetermined cash amount at the expiration of the agreement
dependent upon the closing price of the Company’s Common
Stock at maturity. Upon expiration of the agreement in December
2002, the Company received approximately $29.3 million in
cash. Under the terms of the second agreement and in exchange
for an up front payment of $25 million, the Company is
entitled to receive approximately 2.2 million shares of its
Common Stock or a predetermined cash amount at expiration of the
agreement in March 2003. The form of settlement at maturity of
the second transaction will be dependent upon the closing market
price of the Company’s Common Stock.

The Company sells put warrants that entitle the
holder of each warrant to sell to the Company, generally by
physical delivery, one share of the Company’s Common Stock
at a specified price. During 2002, the Company sold 2,300,000
put warrants at an average strike price of $11.10 and received
premium proceeds of approximately $3.3 million. During
2002, the Company paid $42.9 million for the purchase of
2,050,000 shares upon the exercise of outstanding put
warrants, while 600,000 put warrants expired unexercised. As of

F-24


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2002, 950,000 put warrants were
outstanding, with exercise prices ranging from $7.18 to $12.58,
and expired on various dates between January and March 2003. As
of December 31, 2002, the Company has a total potential
repurchase obligation of approximately $9.9 million
associated with outstanding put warrants, of which
$7.3 million is classified as a put warrant obligation in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The remaining
$2.6 million of outstanding put warrants permit a net-share
settlement at the Company’s option and are not recorded as
a put warrant obligation in the consolidated balance sheet. The
outstanding put warrants classified as a put warrant obligation
on the consolidated balance sheet will be reclassified to
stockholders’ equity when each warrant is exercised or when
it expires. Under the terms of certain put warrant agreements,
the Company must maintain certain levels of cash and investment
balances. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in
compliance with the required levels.

In December 2002, the Company entered into an
agreement with a large financial institution requiring that this
institution sell to the Company up to 1,560,000 million
shares of the Company’s Common Stock at fixed prices if the
Company’s common stock trades at designated levels between
December 16, 2002 and January 23, 2003. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company had a potential remaining
repurchase obligation associated with this agreement of
approximately $9.1 million, which is classified as common
stock subject to repurchase in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet. During January 2003, this agreement expired and
no shares were repurchased.

Stock Splits

On January 19, 2000, the Company announced a
two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on
February 16, 2000, to stockholders of record as of
January 31, 2000.

The number of options issuable and previously
granted and their respective exercise prices under the
Company’s stock option plans have been proportionately
adjusted to reflect stock splits. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect
stock splits.

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. The
Company has no present plans to issue such shares.

8.     CONVERTIBLE
SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

In March 1999, the Company sold $850 million
principal amount at maturity of its zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”) due
March 22, 2019, in a private placement. The Debentures were
priced with a yield to maturity of 5.25% and resulted in net
proceeds to the Company of approximately $291.9 million,
net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of
$9.6 million. Except under limited circumstances, no
interest will be paid on the Debentures prior to maturity. The
Debentures are convertible at the option of the security holder
at any time on or before the maturity date at a conversion rate
of 14.0612 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for each
$1,000 principal amount at maturity of Debentures, subject to
adjustment in certain events. The Company could redeem the
Debentures on or after March 22, 2004. Holders could
require the Company to repurchase the Debentures, on fixed dates
and at set redemption prices (equal to the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount), beginning on March 22,
2004. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a program
authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25 million of
the Debentures in open market purchases. Additionally, in April
2002, the Board of Directors granted additional authority of
$100 million to the Company to repurchase Debentures
through private transactions, bringing the total repurchase
authority to $125 million. The Board of Directors’
authorization to repurchase the Debentures allows the Company to
repurchase Debentures when market conditions are favorable. As
of December 31, 2002, 76,000 units of the Company’s
Debentures representing $76.0 million in principal amount at
maturity, have been repurchased under these programs for
$29.9 million.

9.     FAIR VALUES OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these
items. The Company’s investments classified as
available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, based primarily on
quoted market prices for such financial instruments. The
aggregate fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale
investments was $396.3 million and $437.9 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
Company’s held-to-maturity investments had a carrying value
of $180.4 million and $169.0 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and an aggregate
fair value of $180.2 million and $170.7 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, based on dealer
quotation. The carrying amount of the Company’s Debentures
at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately
$333.5 million and $346.2 million, respectively. The
fair value of the Debentures, based on the quoted market price
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately
$334.0 million and $388.0 million, respectively.

10.     COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases certain office space and
equipment under various operating leases. In addition to rent,
the leases require the Company to pay for taxes, insurance,
maintenance and other operating expenses. Certain of these
leases contain stated escalation clauses while others contain
renewal options.

Rental expense for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled approximately
$24.4 million, $17.1 million and $8.7 million,
respectively. Rental expense for 2002 includes lease losses
associated with the vacancy of certain of the Company’s
leased properties, as discussed below. Sublease income for the
year ended December 31, 2002 was approximately
$1.7 million and there was no sublease income during 2001.
Lease commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with
initial or remaining terms in excess of one year and sublease
income associated with non-cancelable subleases are as follows:

In April 2002, the Company entered into a
synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately
$61.0 million for its corporate headquarters office space
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease represents a
form of off-balance sheet financing under which an unrelated
third party lessor funded 100% of the costs of acquiring the
property and leases the asset to the Company. The synthetic
lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes
and as a financing lease for tax purposes. The Company does not
include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a
liability on its consolidated balance sheet. Consequently,

F-26


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

payments are made pursuant to the lease as
operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements
of income. The Company entered into the synthetic lease in order
to lease its headquarters properties under more favorable terms
than under its previous lease arrangements.

The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven
years. Upon approval by the lessor, the Company can renew the
lease twice for additional two-year periods. The lease payments
vary based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus
a margin. At any time during the lease term, the Company has the
option to sublease the property and upon thirty-days’
written notice, the Company has the option to purchase the
property for an amount representing the original property cost
and transaction fees of approximately $61.0 million plus
any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed. Upon at
least 180 days notice prior to the termination of the
initial lease term, the Company has the option to remarket the
property for sale to a third party. If the Company chooses not
to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, it has
guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately
$51.9 million and possession of the buildings will be
returned to the lessor. If the fair value of the building were
to decline below $51.9 million, the Company would have to
make up the difference under its residual value guarantee, which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition.

The synthetic lease includes certain financial
covenants including a requirement for the Company to maintain a
pledged balance of approximately $63.0 million in cash
and/or investment securities as collateral. The Company manages
the composition of the pledged investments and investment
earnings are available for operating purposes. Additionally, the
Company must maintain a minimum cash and investment balance of
$100.0 million, excluding the Company’s Debentures,
collateralized investments and equity investments, as of the end
of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2002, the
Company had approximately $113.5 million in cash and
investments in excess of those required levels. The synthetic
lease includes non-financial covenants including the maintenance
of the properties and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of
financial statements to the lender of the lessor and prompt
payment of taxes associated with the properties. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all
material provisions of the arrangement.

During 2002 and 2001, the Company took actions to
consolidate certain of its offices, including the exit of
certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain
leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these
existing operating leases continue to 2018 with a total
remaining obligation at December 31, 2002 of approximately
$28.5 million, of which $6.8 million, net of
anticipated sublease income, was accrued for as of
December 31, 2002, and is reflected in accrued expenses in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In
calculating this accrual, the Company made estimates, based on
market information, including the estimated vacancy periods and
sublease rates and opportunities. If actual circumstances prove
to be materially worse than management has estimated, the total
charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly
higher.

11.     INCOME
TAXES

income before income taxes are as follows:

The components of the provision for income taxes
are as follows:

The significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

During the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000, the Company recognized tax benefits related to
the exercise of employee stock options in the amount of
$25.7 million, $28.0 million and $63.9 million,
respectively. This benefit was recorded to additional paid-in
capital. At December 31, 2002, the Company had
approximately $35.4 million of U.S. net operating loss
carryforwards, a substantial portion of which begins to expire
in 2020. The Company will record the benefit of the net
operating loss carryforwards generated from the exercise of
employee stock options, through additional paid-in capital when
the net operating loss carryforwards are utilized.

During 2001, the Company acquired an entity with
approximately $37.9 million of net operating loss
carryforwards. Additionally, the Company had approximately
$6.8 million of net operating loss carryforwards from prior
acquisitions. These net operating loss carryforwards are limited
in any one year pursuant to Internal Revenue Code
Section 382 and begin to expire in 2010. The Company had
approximately $22.9 million of remaining net operating
losses at December 31, 2002 subject to Internal Revenue
Code Section 382 limitations.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had
research and development tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $9.0 million that expire beginning in 2018.
The Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards

F-28


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of approximately $10.7 million at
December 31, 2002 that expire beginning in 2003.
Additionally, the Company had alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $2.1 million at
December 31, 2002. These credits do not expire.

The Company does not expect to remit earnings
from its foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, during 2002 and 2001
the Company did not provide for deferred taxes on foreign
earnings.

A reconciliation of the Company’s effective
tax rate to the statutory federal rate is as follows:

12.     GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS

The Company operates in a single market
consisting of the design, development, marketing, sales and
support of access infrastructure software and services for
enterprise applications. The Company’s revenues are derived
from sales in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa
(“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific regions. These three
geographic regions constitute the Company’s reportable
segments.

The Company does not engage in intercompany
revenue transfers between segments. The Company’s
management evaluates performance based primarily on revenues in
the geographic locations in which the Company operates. Segment
profit for each segment includes certain sales, marketing,
general and administrative expenses directly attributable to the
segment and excludes certain expenses that are managed outside
the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment profit
primarily consist of research and development costs,
amortization of intangible assets, interest, corporate expenses
and income taxes, as well as, non-recurring charges for
in-process research and development and write-down of
technology. Corporate expenses are comprised primarily of
corporate marketing costs, operations and certain general and
administrative expenses, which are separately managed.
Accounting policies of the segments are the same as the
Company’s consolidated accounting policies.

Previously, the Company formed wholly-owned
subsidiaries in various locations within EMEA and Asia-Pacific.
These subsidiaries are responsible for sales and distribution of
the Company’s products. Prior to the formation of these
subsidiaries, sales in these geographic segments were classified
as export sales from the Americas segment. For purposes of the
presentation of segment information, the sales previously
reported as Americas export sales have been reclassified to the
geographical segments where the sale was made for each of the
periods presented.

In July 2001, the Company implemented a new
enterprise resource planning system. The new system was designed
to provide a structure that would meet the growing demands of
the Company and to provide management improved focus on the
results of operations and the Company’s financial
resources. The features and functionality of the new system
allowed the Company to summarize and classify information
included in

F-29


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the results of operations differently than that
provided by the Company’s legacy information systems. The
Company began planning for the new information system in 2000,
and as a result, detailed transaction information for 2001 and
2000, prior to the implementation of the new system, was
retained and converted to the new system. Information for the
years ended 2001 and 2000 has been reclassified to reflect these
changes.

Net revenues and segment profit for 2002, 2001
and 2000 classified by the major geographic area in which the
Company operates, are presented below.

(1)

Represents royalty fees in connection with the
    Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002.

Identifiable assets classified by major
geographic area in which the Company operates are shown below.
Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment, net:

To purchase certain investments during 2002, the
Company initiated an inter-segment loan whereby the Americas
transferred approximately $134 million to EMEA. The
decrease in the Americas identifiable assets and increase in
EMEA’s identifiable assets is primarily the result of this
agreement. This loan was repaid during early 2003.

Export revenue represents shipments of finished
goods and services from the United States to international
customers. As of July 1, 2000, the Company was shipping
finished goods to European and Asia-Pacific customers from its
warehouse location in Europe. Shipments from the United States
to international customers were as follows:

Represents Latin America and Canada geographic
    locations, which are included as part of the Americas geographic

The Company had net revenue attributed to
individual distributors in excess of 10% of total net sales as
follows. There were no individual end-customers that represented
greater than 10% of net sales for any of the years presented.

The Company also tracks revenue according to the
following three categories: License Revenue, Technical Services
Revenue and Royalty Revenue, but does not track expenses or
identifiable assets by category. As a result, these revenue
categories do not constitute segments in accordance with SFAS
No. 131,

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information.

Additional information regarding
revenue by categories is as follows:

13.     DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cash Flow Hedges.

A
substantial portion of the Company’s anticipated overseas
expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in
local currencies. To protect against reductions in value and the
volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency
exchange rates, the Company has established a hedging program.
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce a
portion of its exposure to these potential changes. The terms of
such instruments, and the hedging transactions to which they
relate, generally do not exceed 12 months. Principal
currencies hedged are British pounds sterling, Euros, Swiss
francs, Japanese yen and Australian dollars. The Company could
choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange transaction
exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of
hedging particular exposures, and availability of appropriate
hedging instruments. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
Company had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts
with a notional amount of $48.9 million and
$13.1 million, respectively, and foreign currency forward
purchase contracts with a notional amount of $128.4 million
and $60.9 million, respectively. The aggregate net fair
value of these contracts at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were
recorded as assets of $3.6 million and $0.2 million,
respectively.

In order to manage its exposure to interest rate
risk, in November 2001, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement with a notional amount of
$174.6 million that was to expire in March 2004. The swap
converted the floating rate return on certain of the
Company’s available for sale investment securities to a
fixed interest rate. In October 2002, the Company terminated
this interest rate swap agreement. Upon termination, the Company
received a cash payment of $9.2 million as settlement under
the swap agreement, and there was approximately
$2.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, net
of taxes. The swap was previously accounted for as an effective
cash flow hedge, and in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 133, the remaining $2.4 million, net of taxes, in
accumulated other comprehensive income was to be recognized in
interest income ratably along with the interest cash flows from
the investments through the original termination date of the
swap in March 2004. As a result of the sale of certain
investments underlying this swap agreement in December 2002, the
forecasted interest cash flows from the investments were no
longer probable and interest income of approximately
$3.4 million related to the terminated swap was recognized.

In connection with the efforts to manage the
credit quality and maturities of its available-for-sale
investment portfolio, during 2001 the Company terminated a
forward bond purchase agreement previously designated as a hedge
of forecasted purchases of corporate security investments. As a
result, the Company recorded a realized gain of
$1.4 million, which is included in other expense, net on
the 2001 consolidated statements of income. At the time of the
sale, the Company realized approximately $0.5 million of
amounts previously classified in accumulated other comprehensive
loss.

F-32


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair Value Hedges.

The Company uses derivatives to hedge against the change in fair
value of certain of its available-for-sale securities due to
changes in interest rates. During December 2002, the Company
entered into 12 interest rate swap agreements with an
aggregate notional amount of $208.0 million related to
12 specific available-for-sale securities. The swaps
qualify for the short-cut method of accounting and expire on
various dates through November 2007. The instruments swap the
fixed rate interest on the underlying investments to a variable
rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. Changes in the fair
value of the derivatives are recorded in earnings along with
related designated changes in the value of the underlying
investments.

Derivatives not Designated as
Hedges.

The Company utilizes credit
default contracts for investment purposes that either do not
qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting treatment
under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, changes in the fair value
of these contracts are recorded in other expense, net, if any.
Under the terms of these contracts, the Company assumes the
default risk, above a certain threshold, of a portfolio of
specified high credit quality referenced issuers in exchange for
a fixed yield that is recorded in interest income. In the event
of default by underlying referenced issuers above specified
amounts, the Company will pay the counterparty an amount
equivalent to its loss, not to exceed the notional value of the
contract. The primary risk associated with these transactions is
the default risk of the underlying issuers. The risk levels of
these instruments are equivalent to “AAA” and
“Super AAA” single securities. The purpose of the
credit default contracts is to increase the effective yield on
certain of the Company’s available-for-sale investments.

During December 2002, the Company entered into
two credit default contracts with an aggregate notional amount
of $100.0 million that expire during December 2007. The
Company has pledged $104 million of investment securities
as collateral for these contracts. The Company maintains the
ability to manage the composition of the pledged investments.
Accordingly, these securities are not reflected as restricted
investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
fixed yield earned on these contracts was not material at
December 31, 2002, and is included in interest income in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the year
ended December 31, 2002, there was no change in fair value
of these credit default contracts and there were no credit
events related to the underlying reference issuers.

The ineffectiveness of hedges on existing
derivative instruments for the year ended December 31,
2002, was not material. As of December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded $6.3 million of derivative assets and
$6.2 million of derivative liabilities, representing the
fair values of the Company’s outstanding derivative
instruments in other current assets and accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The change in net unrealized derivative gains
(losses) recognized in other comprehensive income includes
unrealized gains (losses) that arose from changes in market
value of derivatives that were held during the period, and gains
(losses) that were previously unrealized, but have been
recognized in current period net income due to termination or
maturities of derivative contracts. This reclassification has no
effect on total comprehensive income or stockholders’
equity.

The following table presents these components of
other comprehensive income, net of tax:

because their effects were antidilutive for the respective
periods.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,

establishes accounting standards for
the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement
obligation and its associated asset retirement cost. It also
provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. SFAS
No. 143 is effective in fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2002, with early adoption permitted. The Company
expects that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows upon adoption. The Company plans to
adopt SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission
of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”

SFAS
No. 145, among other things, requires gains and losses on
extinguishment of debt to be classified as part of continuing
operations rather than treated as extraordinary, as previously
required in accordance with SFAS 4. SFAS No. 145 also
modifies accounting for subleases where the original lessee
remains the secondary obligor and requires certain modifications
to capital leases to be treated as a sale-leaseback transaction.
The Company early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 145,
during 2002 and recorded $1.6 million in gains from the
repurchase of the Debentures as part of continuing operations in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

. SFAS No. 146 nullifies the guidance
previously provided under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

F-34


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).” Among other things, SFAS No. 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred
as opposed to when there is commitment to a restructuring plan
as set forth under the nullified guidance. The Company will
adopt SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003 and expects no
material impact from adoption on its financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

. SFAS
No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. This statement also
amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements regarding the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company
expects no material impact on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows from adoption.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others

. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be
made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that
it has issued. FIN No. 45 also clarifies requirements for
the recognition of guarantees at the onset of an arrangement.
The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN
No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure
requirements of FIN No. 45 are effective for interim or
annual financial statements after December 15, 2002. The
Company implemented the disclosure requirements of FIN
No. 45 at December 31, 2002. The Company had no
material impact on its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows as a result of this implementation.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

which
addresses consolidation by a business of variable interest
entities in which it is the primary beneficiary. FIN No. 46
is effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and
for variable interest entities created after January 1,
2003, and in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003 for all other variable interest
entities. The Company is currently in the process of determining
the effects, if any, on its financial position, results of
operations and cash flows that will result from the adoption of
FIN No. 46.

16.

LEGAL MATTERS

In February 2002, a stockholder filed a complaint
(the “Complaint”) in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware against the Company and certain of its current
and former officers and directors. The Complaint purported to
state a direct claim on behalf of a putative class of
stockholders and a derivative claim nominally on behalf of the
Company for breach of fiduciary duty based on the Company’s
alleged failure to disclose all material information concerning
the Company’s business and operations in connection with a
proposal to be voted on at the Company’s annual meeting of
stockholders in May 2000. The Complaint asserted claims similar
to those alleged by such stockholder in a suit that was filed in
September 2000, and subsequently voluntarily dismissed without
prejudice in July 2001. The Complaint sought compensatory
damages, rescission of the Company’s 2000 Director and
Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and other related
relief. The parties have since agreed to a non-monetary
settlement of the action not involving the validity of the 2000
Director and Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The
settlement is subject to approval by the court. A hearing on the
approval of the settlement has not yet been scheduled.

In addition, the Company is a defendant in
various matters of litigation generally arising out of the
normal course of business. Although it is difficult to predict
the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, based
on discussions with counsel, that any ultimate liability would
not materially affect the Company’s financial position,
result of operations or cash flows.
