TEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

Citrix
Systems, Inc. (“Citrix” or the “Company”), is a Delaware corporation founded on April 17, 1989. The Company designs, develops and markets access infrastructure software, services and appliances. The Company markets and licenses
its products through multiple channels such as value-added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators, independent software vendors and its websites. The Company also promotes its products through relationships with a wide variety of
industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”).

Business Strategy

Citrix is committed to
achieving its vision of making every organization an on-demand enterprise where information is securely, easily and instantly accessible from virtually anywhere using any device. The Company’s business strategy leverages its ability to create
and lead new markets through innovation and execution in all phases of product development, marketing and fulfillment.

The Company’s first wave of innovation, in the mid-1990s, enabled the virtualization of the Windows desktop, which made thin-client computing
possible. The Company’s second wave of innovation, in the late-1990s, enabled the virtualization and centralization of most application types, making server-based computing possible. The Company’s third and ongoing wave of innovation is
focused on creating access infrastructure that connects devices, networks and applications into a core business system that makes on-demand computing a reality.

Citrix Access Infrastructure as a Core Business System

The Company believes that access infrastructure has the potential of being viewed as a core business system because it solves a core business problem:
getting the right information securely, easily and instantly to everyone who needs it, when they need it, wherever they are. This is becoming more difficult to accomplish as more and more people conduct business in remote and mobile situations
– unpredictably moving from location to location, using multiple access devices, and connecting with a wide range of heterogeneous applications over wired, wireless and Web networks.

To meet this challenge, Citrix’s access infrastructure addresses one of the basic technical challenges businesses face
today: the need to provide secure access to private information over both trusted and untrusted networks. Access infrastructure accomplishes this by connecting devices, networks and applications into a system that provides secure, easy and instant
access to virtually any information source, for any authorized user, from virtually anywhere, using any connection.

The Company believes that its Citrix access infrastructure helps to transform any organization into an on-demand enterprise. This means that, for a single
investment in access infrastructure, businesses get two key benefits: improved operational efficiency that reduces the cost of running Citrix’s business, and accelerated agility that enables the business to capitalize on more opportunities for
growing the business.

When used together, Citrix access
infrastructure products, including software, services and appliance-based solutions provide a set of capabilities that meet the access needs of end-users on the demand side of the information supply chain, as well as the needs of IT administrators
on the supply side of the information supply chain. These capabilities include:

•

SmartAccess

– Senses and responds to any access scenario for tailored secure access control.

•

SmoothRoaming

– Delivers continuous access across devices, networks and locations for maximum mobility.

•

Instant collaboration

– Easily shares workspaces and information from anywhere to increase workgroup and meeting productivity.

•

On-Demand assistance

– Instantly access remote user support to increase business productivity and customer loyalty.



•

•

Integrated identity management

– Activate and manages the complete access lifecycle for improved workforce agility.

•

•

Citrix

®

Access Gateway.

The Citrix Access Gateway is a new alternative to Internet Protocol Security (“IPSec”) and traditional Secure Socket Layer Virtual Private Networks (“SSL
VPN”) that combines the strengths of IPSec and SSL VPN without their typical weaknesses, offered in an easy-to-deploy appliance. The gateway allows end-users to access IT resources in the same secure way whether they are in front of or behind
the firewall, and gives end-users the same experience regardless of their location. For an IT administrator, installation and configuration of both the appliance and client is quick and easy. In addition, as the single point of access, the gateway
greatly reduces the complexity and cost involved in managing a variety of different access scenarios for end-users.

•

Citrix

®

Application Gateway.

The Citrix Application Gateway delivers productivity applications to end-users of Internet Protocol (“IP”) telephones and mobile devices, enabling enterprises
to further leverage their IP telephony investment and increase workforce productivity by delivering converged applications to the screens and speakers of IP telephones. The Application Gateway delivers applications to end-users of IP telephones from
leading IP PBX vendors including Avaya, Cisco, Mitel, NEC, Nortel Networks and Siemens.

These services accounted for approximately 8% of the Company’s net revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002 and are included in services revenue in the
Company’s accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Citrix
Technology

Citrix products are based on a full range of
industry-standard technologies. In addition, some Citrix products also include the Company’s proprietary technologies known as the Independent Computing Architecture (“ICA”) protocol, which allows an application’s graphical
end-user interface to be displayed on virtually any client device while the application logic is executed on a central server. Because the ICA

®

protocol moves client-based application processing to the server, this approach enables centralized management of applications, end-users, servers,
licenses and other system components for greater efficiency and lower cost.

The Company’s ICA

®

technology also minimizes the amount of data traveling across an end-user’s network as only encrypted screen refreshes, keystrokes and mouse clicks are transported to and from the client device. This increases
remote access security, improves application performance and allows even wireless access to the latest, most powerful applications and information.



Citrix products are also based on the industry-standard Extensible Markup Language (“XML”).
Leveraging XML assures open systems interaction for customers regardless of data source or platform. And by supporting XML, which is the standard for future Web services-based applications, Citrix helps customers get from the client/server world of
today to the Web services environments of tomorrow.

Citrix Customers

Citrix offers a portfolio of products and services that
target small, medium and large sized organizations in the commercial, government and education sectors. Currently, Citrix has more than 160,000 customers worldwide, including 100% of the

Fortune

100, 99% of the

Fortune

500 and 97% of
the

Fortune

Global 100.

The Company offers perpetual
software licenses for MetaFrame Access Suite products, annual subscriptions for Web-based Citrix Online services, and beginning in 2005 specialized hardware appliances for Citrix Access Gateway products. Perpetual license software products come in
both “shrink wrapped” and electronic-based forms. The Company distributes the software in various formats including traditional “boxed” packages for small projects and customers and electronically downloaded formats for its large
projects and enterprise customers. The Company’s Web-based services can be accessed over any Internet connection during the subscription period. Hardware appliances come pre-loaded with software for which customers can purchase perpetual
licenses.

Technology Relationships

The Company has entered into a number of technology relationships to develop
customer markets for its products, broaden the use of the ICA protocol as an industry standard technology for distributed Windows and non Windows applications and to accelerate the development of its existing and future product lines.

Microsoft.

Since its inception, the Company has
had a number of license agreements with Microsoft, including licenses relating to Microsoft OS/2, Windows 3.x, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT

®

, Windows CE and Internet Explorer. These agreements have provided the Company with access to certain Microsoft source and object code, technical
support and other materials.

In May 1997, the Company entered
into a five-year joint license, development and marketing agreement with Microsoft, (as amended, the “Microsoft Development Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company licensed its multi-user Windows NT extensions to Microsoft for inclusion
in future versions of Windows NT server software. Pursuant to the Microsoft Development Agreement, the Company’s multi-user Windows NT extensions technology was incorporated into Microsoft’s NT Terminal Server, which was released in July
1998, and Windows 2000 Server, which was released in February 2000.

In May 2002, the Company signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide the Company with access to Microsoft Windows Server source code for current and future Microsoft Server operating systems, including access to Windows Server 2003 and
terminal services source code, during the three year term of the agreement. This agreement was terminated in December 2004 and did not provide for payments to or from Microsoft.

In December 2004, the Company entered into a technology collaboration agreement with Microsoft to further enhance the
overall extensibility of Windows

®

Terminal Server.
In conjunction with the technology collaboration agreement, the Company and Microsoft entered into a patent cross license and source code licensing agreements to renew the Company’s access to source code for current versions of Microsoft
Windows Server that had previously been provided to the Company pursuant to the agreement between Microsoft and the Company dated May 2002. The technology collaboration agreement also provides for access by the Company to the source code for the
forthcoming Microsoft Windows Server codenamed “Longhorn.” The technology collaboration agreement has a five-year term which expires in December 2009. The technology collaboration, patent cross license and source code licensing agreements
do not provide for payments to or from Microsoft.

There can be
no assurances that the Company’s agreements with Microsoft will be extended or renewed by Microsoft upon their respective expirations or that, if renewed or extended, such agreements will be on terms favorable to the Company. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results.”



Additional Relationships.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had entered
into approximately 100 ICA license agreements. Currently, numerous devices incorporate Citrix ICA, including Windows CE devices, Macintosh clients, Linux Terminals, and other information appliances, such as wireless phones and other handheld
devices. ICA licensees include Wyse Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, Neoware, Fujitsu, MaxSpeed and SAP AG, among others.

In addition, the Citrix accessPARTNER network includes Citrix Alliance Partners

™

, which are a coalition of industry-leading companies from across the IT spectrum who work with the Company to design
and market complementary solutions for the Company and the customers of Citrix Alliance Partners. The Company’s existing alliance and channel programs, including the Citrix Business Alliance, are now included as part of the Citrix accessPARTNER
network. For further information on the Citrix accessPARTNER network see “— Sales, Marketing and Support.” By the end of 2004, the number of Citrix Alliance Partners had grown to approximately 1,800 members, including hardware,
software, global and regional consulting alliances. Citrix Premier Plus Alliance Partners include Microsoft, Dell, IBM, EMC


, Hewlett-Packard, Siebel Systems, SAP AG, Sun Microsystems and Oracle.

Research and Development

The Company focuses
its research and development efforts on developing new products and core technologies for its access infrastructure markets and further enhancing the functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing products. In 2004, the Company
acquired additional expertise in Web-based services, telephony, voice over internet protocol and secure access appliances. The Company solicits extensive input concerning product development from end-users, both directly from end-customers and
indirectly through its channel distributors.

The Company
believes that its software development team and core technologies represent a significant competitive advantage for the Company. Included in the software development team is a group focused on research activities that include prototyping ways to
integrate emerging technologies and standards into the Company’s product offerings, such as emerging Web services technologies and Microsoft’s newest Windows Server technologies. Other groups within the software development team have
expertise in XML-based software development, integration of acquired technology, multi-tier Web-based application development and deployment and secure sockets layers-based (“SSL”) secure access. The Company maintains a team working
on-site at Microsoft focused on enhancing and adding value to the next generation of Microsoft Windows Server products and operating systems.

The software development team also includes a number of key employees who were instrumental in the release of Microsoft’s Window’s NT 4.0
Terminal Server Edition, have expertise in current Microsoft and UNIX operating system environments (Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and Linux), and were key members from the engineering team that developed the original version of OS/2 at IBM. During 2004,
2003 and 2002, the Company incurred research and development expenses of approximately $86.4 million, $64.4 million and, $68.9 million, respectively.

Sales, Marketing and Support

The Company markets and licenses its products primarily through multiple channels worldwide, including value added resellers, channel distributors, system
integrators (“SI”s) and independent software vendors (“ISV”s), managed by the Company’s worldwide sales force. The Company provides training and certification to integrators, value-added resellers and consultants for a
full-range of Citrix-based application deployment and management solutions and services through its accessPARTNER network.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had relationships with approximately 90 distributors and approximately 4,700 Citrix Solution Advisors worldwide. A
number of entities with which the Company has channel relationships provide additional end-customer sales channels for the Company’s products under either a Citrix brand or embedded in the licensee’s own software product. For information
regarding entities with which the Company has technology relationships, including Citrix Alliance Partners, see “— Technology Relationships.”

In 2004, the Company established the global network of partners called Citrix accessPARTNER. This network spans the system
integrators, value-added distributors, resellers, alliance partners, developers, and certified and education professionals who advise on, sell, implement, and provide training for Citrix products and services. At the core of this community are the
Citrix Solution Advisors who deliver strategic and successful access infrastructure solutions to Citrix



customers. Early in 2004, the Company introduced a new program called Citrix Advisor Rewards designed to reward partners for registering projects, submitting
forecasts early in the sales process, and providing value-based solutions around Citrix access infrastructure.

The Company regularly takes actions to improve the effectiveness of and strengthen its channel relationships, including eliminating non-performing
partners, adding new partners with expertise in selling into new markets, and forming additional relationships with global and regional SIs and ISVs. During 2004 and 2003, the Company particularly focused on streamlining and simplifying sales
processes, improving channel incentive programs to reward solution-selling, and training. The Company combined its existing channel programs, including the Citrix Solutions Network

™

, into the Citrix accessPARTNER network, a single, global network that spans the
solution advisors, SIs, value-added distributors, resellers, alliance partners, and certified education professionals who advise on, sell, implement and provide training for the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite and related products and services. At the
core of this community are Solution Advisors — value-added resellers who deliver strategic and successful access infrastructure solutions for customers. SIs and ISVs are becoming a more central part of Citrix’s strategy in the large
enterprise and government markets. The SI program includes members such as IBM, HP, Computer Sciences Corporation, Electronic Data Systems Corporation, Schlumberger, Siemens and Northrop Grumman. The ISV program has a strong representation from
targeted industry verticals such as healthcare, financial services and telecommunications. Members in the ISV program include Amdocs, Cerner, Dell, McKesson, Siemens Medical Health Solutions, Reynolds & Reynolds, ESRI and Ericsson, among others.

The Company’s sales and marketing organization actively
supports its distributors and resellers. The Company’s sales organization consists of field-based systems sales engineers and corporate sales professionals. Additional sales personnel, based in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and
South America, support these field personnel. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” and Note 12 to the Company’s Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information regarding the Company’s segments. These additional sales personnel recruit prospective customers, provide technical advice with respect to the Company’s products and work closely with key distributors and
resellers of the Company’s products. During 2004 and 2003, the Company grew its sales force of sales professionals that work closely with partners to sell to medium and large enterprise customers to achieve the appropriate combination of
relationships for licensing, integration and consulting to meet customers’ needs. These and other account penetration efforts are part of the Company’s strategy to increase the usage of Citrix software within the customer’s IT
organization.

The Company’s marketing department provides
training, sales event support, sales collateral, advertising, direct mail and public relations coverage to its indirect channels to aid in market development and in attracting new customers. In 2003, the Company launched a multi-million-dollar,
worldwide advertising campaign. Beginning September 2003, and extending throughout 2004 and into 2005, this multi-media campaign combines CIO-targeted and customer-focused print, Web, billboard and radio advertisements to raise Citrix’s brand
awareness using the CIOs of household-name customers to describe the benefits of becoming an on-demand enterprise with Citrix access infrastructure.

The Company provides most of its distributors with stock balancing and price protection rights. These transactions are estimated and provided for at the
time of sale as a reduction of revenue. Stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to the Company up to the forty-fifth day of the fiscal quarter, subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of other Citrix products prior to the
last day of the same fiscal quarter. The Company is not obligated to accept product returns from its distributors under any other conditions, unless the product item is defective in manufacture. Product items returned to the Company under the
stock-balancing program must be in new, unused and unopened condition. Price protection rights require that the Company grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of Citrix products held by distributors or resellers if the Company lowers
its prices for such products. In the event that the Company decides to reduce its prices, it will establish a reserve to cover exposure to distributor inventory. The Company has not reduced and has no current plans to reduce the prices of its
products for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 2 to the Company’s Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s revenue recognition policy.

Except for the Web-based desktop access services offered by the Citrix Online division, the Company’s other service activities are related to
post-sale technical support, pre- and post-sale consulting and product training services. Post-sale technical support is offered through Citrix-operated support centers located in the United States, Ireland, Tokyo and Australia. In most cases, the
Company provides technical advice to channel distributors and entities with which the Company has a technology relationship, who act as the first line of technical assistance for end-customers. In some cases, end-customers can also choose from a
Citrix-delivered fee-based support program ranging from one-time incident charges



to an enterprise-level support agreement covering multiple sites and servers. In addition, the Company also provides free technical advice through on-line
support systems, including its Web-based “Knowledge Center.” For pre- and post-sale consulting, Citrix Consulting, a consulting services organization, provides both exploratory and fee-based consulting services. These services include
on-site systems design and implementation services targeted primarily at enterprise-level clients with complex IT environments. Citrix Consulting is also responsible for the development of best practice knowledge that is disseminated to businesses
with which Citrix has a business relationship and end-customers through training and written documentation. Leveraging these best practices enables the Company’s integration resellers to provide more complex systems, reach new buyers within
existing customer organizations and provide more sophisticated system proposals to prospective customers. Training services for business, end-customers and partners are provided through the Company’s CALC program and eLearning. CALCs are
staffed with instructors that have been certified by Citrix and teach their students using Citrix-developed courseware. Over 300 of the world’s leading IT training organizations are CALCs. eLearning is available through both CALCs and from
Citrix’s website.

Operations

The Company controls all purchasing, inventory, scheduling, order processing
and accounting functions related to its operations. Production, warehousing and shipping are performed internally in the United States and by independent contractors on a purchase order basis in Ireland, depending upon the customer’s geographic
market. Master software CD-ROMs, development of user manuals, packaging designs, initial product quality control and testing are performed at the Company’s facilities. In some cases, independent contractors duplicate CD-ROMs, print
documentation, and package and assemble product to the Company’s specifications. To date, the Company has not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of its products. Internal manufacturing capabilities
and independent contractors provide a redundant source of manufacture and assembly.

The Company generally ships products upon receipt of an order. As a result, the Company does not have significant backlog at any given time, and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future
performance.

Competition

As the markets for the Company’s products continue to develop,
additional companies, including Microsoft and other companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware, software and networking industries could enter the markets in which the Company competes and further intensify competition.

In addition, alternative products for secure, remote access in
the Internet software and hardware markets directly and indirectly compete with the Company’s current products and anticipated future product offerings. Existing or new products that extend Internet software and hardware to provide Web-based
information and application access or interactive computing can materially impact the Company’s ability to sell its products in this market. The Company’s competitors in this market include Cisco, Juniper Networks, Oracle, Sun
Microsystems, WebEx Communications, Inc. and other makers of secure remote access solutions.

See “— Technology Relationships” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results.” The
announcement of the release, and the actual release, of products competitive to the Company’s existing and future product lines, could cause existing and potential customers of the Company to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of its
existing and future product offerings, which would adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

While the Company’s competitive position could be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary
information, the Company believes that because of the rapid pace of technological change in the industry, factors such as the technical expertise, knowledge and innovative skill of the Company’s management and technical personnel, its
technology relationships, name recognition, the timeliness and quality of support services provided by the Company and its ability to rapidly develop, enhance and market software products could be more significant in maintaining the Company’s
competitive position. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results.”

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We design, develop and market access infrastructure software, services and appliances. We market and license our products through multiple channels such
as value-added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators, independent software vendors and our websites. We also promote our products through relationships with a wide variety of industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation
(“Microsoft”).

Acquisitions

Net6

On December 8, 2004, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Net6, Inc. or Net6, a leader in
providing secure access gateways. The acquisition extends our ability to provide easy and secure access to virtually any resource, both data and voice, on-demand. The results of operations of Net6 are included in our results of operations beginning
after December 8, 2004 as part of our Americas geographic segment. The consideration for this transaction was approximately $49.2 million paid in cash. In addition to the purchase price, there were direct transaction costs associated with the
acquisition of approximately $1.7 million. The sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments.

Expertcity

On February 27, 2004, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Expertcity.com, Inc. or Expertcity, a market leader in Web-based
desktop access as well as a leader in Web-based training and customer assistance products. The results of operations of Expertcity are included in our results of operations beginning after February 27, 2004.

The consideration for this transaction was approximately $241.4 million,
comprised of approximately $112.6 million in cash, approximately 5.9 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $124.4 million and direct transaction costs of approximately $4.4 million. These amounts include additional common stock
earned by Expertcity upon the achievement of certain revenue and other financial milestones during 2004 pursuant to the merger agreement, which will be issued during 2005. The fair value of the common stock earned as additional purchase price
consideration was recorded as goodwill on the date earned. The sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments and our authorized common stock. There is no further contingent consideration
related to the transaction.

Purchase Accounting for Our Acquisitions

Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase
price was allocated to Expertcity’s and Net6’s respective net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Independent valuation specialists assisted us in determining the fair values of a significant portion of the
net assets associated with these transactions.

The allocation
of the purchase price is summarized below (in thousands):



Net assets acquired from Expertcity consisted mainly of cash and investments, accounts receivable,
deferred revenues and other current liabilities. Net liabilities acquired from Net6 consisted mainly of cash, accounts receivable, deferred revenues and other current and long-term liabilities.

Intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition are comprised of
core and product technologies, trade names, covenants not to compete and customer relationships. Intangible assets acquired in the Net6 acquisition are comprised of core and product technologies, customer relationships and covenants not to compete.
The goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. The valuation of the trade names for Expertcity was determined based on assigning a royalty rate to the revenue stream that was expected from the services
using the trade name. The pre-tax royalty rate was applied to the product revenue and discounted to a present value. The valuation of core and product technology was based on the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with
Expertcity’s and Net6’s existing products. The value of customer relationships was determined based on Expertcity’s and Net6’s estimated future discounted cash flows of the relationships in place after considering historical
attrition rates.

We expensed purchased in–process
research and development of approximately $18.7 million related to the Expertcity acquisition and $0.4 million related to the Net6 acquisition immediately upon the closing of the mergers. For more information regarding the in-process research and
development acquired from Expertcity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations” and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically evaluate these estimates and
judgments based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of
operations could be materially impacted.

We believe that the
accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that could have been
used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting
policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.”

Other significant accounting policies,
primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our
accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.

Revenue Recognition.

The accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry
practices, both of which are subject to change. As a result, revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments. In addition, our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on
evaluation of customer-specific information, historical collection experience and economic market conditions.

We sell most of our MetaFrame Access Suite products bundled with an initial subscription for software license updates that provide the end-user with free
enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis. Customers may also elect to purchase technical support, product training or consulting services. We allocate revenue to software license updates and any other
undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective



evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria
have been met. The balance of the revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is allocated to the delivered software product using the residual method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the software licenses are
delivered. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on VSOE, we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively
determined. We must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the VSOE of fair value for each element, considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for software license updates.

In the normal course of business, we do not permit product
returns, but we do provide most of our distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty-fifth day of the fiscal quarter,
subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter. Price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or
resellers if we lower our prices for such products. We establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are
established based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by product, the impact of any new
product releases and projected economic conditions. Actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are, however, dependent upon future events, including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors
and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments. We continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe
actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves. Our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns. If actual experience or
changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns, we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end-user. Allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately $2.3
million at December 31, 2004 and $3.0 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease in allowances for estimated product returns is a reflection of the decrease in stock rotation experience primarily due to a reduction in packaged product inventory held
by our distributors resulting from an increase in enterprise customer license arrangements, which are typically delivered electronically. We have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors
or resellers. Accordingly, there were no reserves required for price protection at December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003. We also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume-based incentives, at the
time the sale is recorded. If market conditions were to decline, we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings, which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered.

Core and Product Technology Assets.

We review
acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology. We have acquired our core and product technology assets primarily from our
Net6, Expertcity and Sequoia acquisitions as well as under other third party agreements. The core and product technology assets acquired in our Net6 acquisition will extend our ability to provide easy and secure access through our MetaFrame Access
Suite of products. The core and product technology assets acquired in our Expertcity acquisition form the basis of our Citrix Online division and the assets acquired in our Sequoia acquisition, as well as under other third party agreements, form the
basis for our MetaFrame Secure Access Manager product. The recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize these products. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased Sequoia and other technology
is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with our MetaFrame Secure Access Manager. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased Expertcity technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
associated with our Citrix Online services. Our revenues are forecasted based on historical sales, data received from rate projections on our subscribing customer base and estimates from our sales channels and end-customer sales force. Our
assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of MetaFrame Secure Access Manager and our Citrix Online products. Actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted
amounts. As of December 31, 2004, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from core and product technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value. If these products are not ultimately accepted by
our customers, and there is no alternative future use for this technology, we could determine that some or all of their remaining $36.3 million carrying value is impaired. In the event of impairment, we would record an impairment charge to earnings
that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



On December 8, 2004, we acquired Net6, which resulted in additional core and product technology of $13.3
million, net of amortization, at December 31, 2004. For more information concerning our acquisition of Net6, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Acquisitions.”

Goodwill.

At December 31, 2004, we had
$361.5 million in goodwill primarily related to our acquisitions of Net6, Expertcity and Sequoia. The goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. We operate in a single market consisting of the design,
development, marketing and support of access infrastructure software, hardware and services for enterprise applications. Our revenues are derived from sales in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific regions and
from our Citrix Online division. These three geographic regions and the Citrix Online division constitute our reportable segments. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments. We
evaluate goodwill along these segments, which represent our reporting units. Substantially all of our goodwill at December 31, 2004 was associated with our Americas and Citrix Online reportable segments.

On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard or
SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, our goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill with a
net book value at January 1, 2002 of $152.4 million, including $10.1 million of acquired workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets. Excluding goodwill, we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives.

We use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed
for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent
with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we completed the required impairment tests of goodwill at the date of adoption and annually as required. There were no impairment
charges recorded as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 or annual impairment tests. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill
could change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Current and Deferred Tax Assets.

We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we
operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2004, the Company has $40.8 million in net deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

requires a valuation allowance to
reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for
recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income, gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2004, we
determined that a valuation allowance of approximately $1.3 million relating to foreign tax credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. If the estimates and assumptions
used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes.

In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which
the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as
appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings.
Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which
may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Stock-based Compensation Disclosures

Our stock option program is a broad based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and reward talented employees and align stockholder and
employee interests. The number and frequency of stock option grants are based on competitive practices, our operating results, the number of options available for grant under our shareholder approved plans, and other factors. All employees are
eligible to participate in the stock option program.



As of December 31, 2004, we had six stock-based compensation plans, including plans assumed in
acquisitions. We typically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the shares at the date of grant. As discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements,
we apply the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board or APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and related interpretations in accounting for our plans except for 51,546 options assumed as part of the
Net6 acquisition, which were accounted for in with FASB Interpretation No. 44,

Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25)

because they had an exercise price below market value.
No stock-based compensation cost has been reflected in net income except for the amounts related to the 51,546 options assumed as part of the Net6 acquisition. The impact of our fixed stock plans and our stock purchase plan on our consolidated
financial statements from the use of options is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution.

The following table (in thousands, except option price) provides information as of December 31, 2004 about the securities authorized for issuance to our
employees and directors under our fixed stock compensation plans, consisting of our Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Plan, the Third Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Amended and Restated 1995 Non-Employee Director Option
Plan and the Second Amended and Restated 2000 Director and Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan:

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data and presentation of that data as a percentage of change from period-to-period.

not meaningful.

Net Revenues.

Our operations consist of the design, development, marketing and support of access infrastructure software and
services that enable effective and efficient enterprise-wide deployment and management of applications and information.

Net revenues include the following categories: Software Licenses, Software License Updates, Services, and Other. Software Licenses primarily represents
fees related to the licensing of our MetaFrame Access Suite products. These revenues are reflected net of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return rights. The MetaFrame Presentation Server product accounted for approximately 93.3%
of our Software License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004, 97.6% of our Software License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 97.7% of our Software License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. Software License Updates
consists of fees related to our Subscription Advantage program (our terminology for post contract support) that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Subscription Advantage is an annual renewable
program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades, enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription. Services consist primarily of technical support services and
Web-based desktop access services revenue recognized ratably over the contract term, revenue from product training and certification, and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our software products, which are recognized as the
services are provided. In May 1997, we entered into a five-year joint license, development and marketing agreement with the Microsoft Corporation or the Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002. Other revenues in 2002 represents
the royalty fees recognized in connection with the Microsoft Development Agreement.

Net revenues increased $152.5 million during 2004 compared to 2003. Software License revenue decreased $4.6 million during 2004 primarily due to a weakness in our packaged product sales which are typically purchased
by medium and small-sized businesses. Software License Updates revenue increased $102.8 million during 2004 primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewal rates related to our Subscription Advantage program. Services revenue
increased



$54.4 million during 2004 primarily due to the addition of the Citrix Online division resulting from our February 2004 Expertcity acquisition. We currently
expect Subscription Advantage to continue to be of strategic importance to our business in 2005 because it fosters long-term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue
stream.

In January 2004, we launched our Advisor Rewards
Program which gives sales incentives to resellers for the sale of certain license types. In the third quarter of 2004, we extended our Advisor Rewards Program to a broader range of license types, which we anticipate will continue to stimulate demand
for our MetaFrame products from smaller customers and projects. Revenues associated with our Advisor Rewards Program is partially offset by the associated incentives to our resellers.

Net revenues increased $61.2 million during 2003 compared to 2002. Software License revenue increased $11.3 million during
2003 primarily due to an increase in Software Licenses, revenue from the sale of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server, under enterprise customer license arrangements. Also, the increase over 2002 was partially due to weakness during 2002 in packaged
product sales to our distributors and resellers, associated with a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors and overall weakness in IT spending during 2002. Software License Updates revenue increased $63.1 million during 2003
compared to 2002 primarily due to the continued acceptance of our renewable Subscription Advantage program. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Other revenue of $14.1 million during 2003 associated with the expiration of the
Microsoft Development Agreement in May 2002.

Deferred
revenues, primarily related to Citrix Subscription Advantage and Services revenues, increased approximately $60.1 million compared to December 31, 2003. The significant increase was due primarily to increased renewals of Citrix Subscription
Advantage, and the services sold by our Citrix Online division, which were acquired from Expertcity. We expect deferred revenue to increase in 2005 due primarily to currently expected increases in both annual contract adoptions for Citrix Online
services and Subscription Advantage renewals.

International
and Segment Revenues.

International revenues (sales outside of the United States) accounted for approximately 53.2% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, 54.6% of our net revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2003, and 53.7% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002.

An analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below:

(1)

Our Americas segment is comprised of the United States, Canada and Latin America.

(2)

Defined as Europe, Middle East and Africa.

(3)

Represents royalty fees in connection with the Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002.

With respect to our segment revenues, the increase in net revenues during
2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all geographic segments, particularly Europe. The increase in net revenues during 2003 as compared to 2002 was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all
geographic segments. For additional information on international revenues, please refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues consists primarily of the compensation costs and other personnel-related costs of
providing services and amortization of core and product technology, as well as costs of product media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials and shipping expense service capacity costs and royalties. Cost of software licenses revenues
decreased $9.7 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due primarily to a decrease in royalties due to the expiration of certain



license agreements. Cost of services revenues increased $10.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the addition of our Citrix Online division
resulting from the February 2004 Expertcity acquisition. Amortization of core and product technology decreased $4.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the reclassification of certain intangible tax assets related to a 2001
acquisition from a product technology intangible asset to goodwill resulting in an approximately $7.2 million reduction in amortization expense partially offset due to an increase in amortization expense related to core and product technology
intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition. Cost of revenues for software licenses revenues, cost of services revenues and amortization of core and product technology for 2003 remained relatively unchanged compared to 2002.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin as a percent of
revenue was 96.4% for 2004, 94.7% for 2003 and 94.3% for 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the decrease in cost of revenues as discussed above. We currently anticipate
that in the next twelve months, gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively unchanged as compared with current levels. Gross margin, however, will fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors attributable to the
cost of revenues as discussed above.

Operating
Expenses.

As further discussed below, during 2002 we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately 10% (approximately 200 employees) and consolidated certain functions from our Salt Lake City, Utah and Columbia,
Maryland facilities into our Fort Lauderdale, Florida facility. As a result of such actions, we incurred expenses of approximately $10.9 million, primarily for severance and related facility expenses, of which approximately $7.0 million were
included in research and development expenses, $2.8 million were included in sales, marketing and support expenses and $1.1 million were included in general and administrative expenses.

Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impact on
our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. As a result of this policy, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the
current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year. Since the U.S. dollar was generally weak in 2004, we currently expect that operating expenses will be higher in 2005 but further dollar weakness in 2005 will not
have a further material adverse impact on our operating expenses until 2006.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-based Compensation,

we currently account for share-based payments to employees using the APB Opinion No. 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally
recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment.

SFAS No. 123R requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options
and similar awards. SFAS No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: A “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on
the effective date. A “prospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123R for purposes
of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing
cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current literature. We are currently in the process of determining the effects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows that will result from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and
development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs. We expense substantially all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products as incurred except for certain core
technologies with alternative future use. Research and development expenses increased approximately $21.9 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel costs, as well as an increase in staffing
and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition. During 2005, we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to make investments in our business and hire personnel to achieve our product development
goals.



Research and development expenses decreased approximately $4.5 million during 2003 as compared to 2002,
primarily due to severance, relocation and reduced headcount costs and related facility charges associated with the consolidation of our Salt Lake City, Utah and Columbia, Maryland development teams into our remaining engineering facilities in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida during 2002. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs for external consultants and developers.

Sales, Marketing and Support Expenses.

Sales, marketing and support expenses increased approximately $84.8 million during
2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel and related personnel costs and increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals and an increase in
staffing and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition. In addition, there was an increase in marketing program costs resulting from our worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign and from the marketing of services
related to our Citrix Online division, which were introduced in the first quarter of 2004. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the allocation of certain revenue generating services expenses from operating expense to cost of
services revenues. During 2005, we currently expect sales, marketing and support expenses to increase as we continue to make investments in our business to achieve our strategic goals.

Sales, marketing and support expenses increased approximately $17.4 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to
increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals. In addition and to a lesser extent, the increase in marketing program costs resulted primarily from our launch of a worldwide brand
awareness and advertising campaign and increases in product training costs and reseller commissions associated with the increase in our software license updates.

General and Administrative Expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased
approximately $20.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in external consulting and services associated with regulatory compliance requirements and information systems, an increase in headcount and related personnel
costs as well as an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition.

General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.3 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to a decrease in depreciation
expense resulting from asset maturities and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements during 2002 and a decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation resulting
from the achievement of our financial targets and an increase in insurance costs.

Amortization of Other Intangible Assets.

Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $5.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in
amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition. As of December 31, 2004, we had unamortized other identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of $29.4 million. Amortization of
intangible assets remained relatively unchanged in 2003 compared to 2002. Amortization expense totaled $6.2 million during 2004, $0.3 million during 2003 and $0.5 million in 2002. We currently expect amortization expense to increase during 2005 as a
result of our acquisitions. For more information regarding the Net6 and Expertcity acquisitions see, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Acquisitions” and note 3 to our
consolidated financial statements.

In-Process Research and
Development.

During 2004, we acquired Expertcity and Net6 and an aggregate of approximately $19.1 million of the respective purchase prices were allocated to in-process research and development, or IPR&D. The amounts
allocated to IPR&D had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and were written off at the date of the acquisitions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4,

Applicability
of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method

. There were no write-offs of IPR&D during 2003 and 2002. For more information regarding the acquisitions, see “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Acquisitions” and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

Our efforts with respect to the acquired technologies currently consist of design and development that may be required to support the release of the
technologies into updated versions of existing service offerings and potentially new product and service offerings by our Citrix Online division. We currently expect that we will successfully develop new products or services utilizing the acquired
in-process technology, but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of future product or service offerings will be achieved. Furthermore, future developments in the software industry, changes in



technology, changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon product plans. Failure to complete the development
of projects in their entirety, or in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The fair value assigned to IPR&D was based on valuations prepared using methodologies and valuation techniques consistent with those used by
independent appraisers. All fair values were determined using the income approach, which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a project’s sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after-tax cash flows attributable to
the projects. The future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return, which ranged from 17% to 25%. The rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the IPR&D.

Interest
Income.

Interest income decreased approximately $6.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to lower levels of cash and investments held in 2004 that resulted from the maturity of AAA-zero coupon corporate securities
of $195.4 million in March 2004, the payment of approximately $355.7 million for the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures in March 2004 and our payment of approximately $161.8 million in cash for our Expertcity and Net6
acquisitions. Interest income decreased approximately $9.8 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to decreases in interest rates. For more information see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Acquisitions” and “— Liquidity and Capital Resources” and notes 3 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased $13.9 million during 2004 compared to 2003
primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures on March 22, 2004. Interest expense remained relatively unchanged during 2003 compared to 2002 and primarily represented non-cash interest accretion on our convertible
subordinated debentures. For more information see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

Write-off of Deferred Debt Issuance
Costs.

In 2004, we incurred a charge of approximately $7.2 million for our remaining prepaid issuance costs as a result of the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures. For more information on our convertible
subordinated debentures see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

Other income
(expense), net is primarily comprised of remeasurement and foreign currency transaction gains (losses), other-than-temporary declines in the value of our equity investments and realized gains (losses) on the sale of available-for-sale investments.
Other income (expense), net remained relatively constant during 2004 compared to 2003. The $6.9 million increase in other income (expense), net during 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to a decline in remeasurement and foreign currency
transaction losses, as well as, realized gains on the sale of certain of our available-for-sale investments in 2003.

Income Taxes.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA includes a
deduction for 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. We have started an evaluation of the repatriation provision; however, we
do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides guidance concerning key elements of the provision. We expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within
a reasonable period of time following the publication of the anticipated guidance. Based on the provisions of the AJCA, the range of possible amounts that we are eligible to repatriate under this provision is between zero and $500 million. As such,
the related potential range of income tax is between zero and $52 million.

We maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates. Other than through the one-time repatriation provision within the
AJCA, we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, since 2000 we have not provided for deferred taxes on foreign earnings.

In 2004, our effective tax rate decreased to 20% from 21% in 2003, primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that
are taxed at a lower rate. In 2003, our effective tax rate increased to 21% from 17% in 2002 primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed at a higher rate. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate
throughout 2005 based on a number of factors including variations in estimated taxable



income in our geographic locations, repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the AJCA, completed and potential acquisitions, and changes in
statutory tax rates, among others.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2004, we generated positive operating cash flows
of $265.3 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $131.5 million, adjusted for, among other things, tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of $20.9
million, non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $33.6 million, the write off of in-process research and development associated with the Net6 and Expertcity acquisitions of $19.1 million, the write-off of deferred debt issuance
costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of $7.2 million, provision for product returns of $6.7 million, the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs of $4.3 million and an aggregate increase in cash flow from
our operating assets and liabilities of $42.5 million. Our investing activities provided $39.3 million of cash consisting primarily of the net proceeds, after reinvestment, from sales and maturities of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
investments of $221.3 million partially offset by cash paid for the Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $140.8 million, the expenditure of $24.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment and cash paid for licensing
agreements and core technology of $16.8 million. Our financing activities used cash of $414.1 million related to $355.7 million of cash paid for the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures and $121.9 million of cash paid under our
stock repurchase programs partially offset by $63.5 million in proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans.

During 2003, we generated positive operating cash flows of $255.4 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $126.9 million, adjusted
for, among other things, tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of $10.3 million, non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization expenses of $34.3 million,
the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of $18.2 million and an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $60.9 million, primarily
resulting in an increase in deferred revenue due to the success of our Subscription Advantage program. Our investing activities used cash of $89.3 million consisting primarily of purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities,
of $75.3 million and the expenditure of $11.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment. Our financing activities used cash of $65.5 million related primarily to the expenditure of $124.6 million for the stock repurchase program, partially
offset by the proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans of $58.4 million.

Cash and Investments

As of December 31, 2004, we had $417.1 million in cash and investments compared to $751.8 million at December 31, 2003. Additionally, at December 31, 2004, we had $149.1 million of restricted cash equivalents and investments, see
“— Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments” below. The $334.7 million decrease in cash and investments as compared to December 31, 2003, was due primarily to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures and
expenditures related to our Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions partially offset by positive cash flow from operations and stock option exercises. We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade, highly liquid securities to allow
for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs. Our short and long-term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources — Convertible Subordinated Debentures” and notes 3 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Included in short-term investments in 2003 were $192.5 million in AAA-rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as
held-to-maturity investments that matured on March 22, 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had no investments classified as held-to-maturity.

Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments

As of December 31, 2004, we had $149.1 million in restricted cash equivalents and investments. Approximately $62.8 million in investment securities and
cash equivalents were pledged as collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease and approximately $86.3 million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for certain of our credit default contracts and interest rate swaps.
The $2.6 million increase in restricted cash and investments compared to December 31, 2003 is primarily due to an increase in the liability position of the interest rate swaps associated with the contracts being



collateralized. Restricted cash at December 31, 2004 is comprised of cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. We maintain the ability to
manage the composition of the restricted cash equivalents and investments within certain limits to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes. For further information regarding our synthetic lease,
credit default contracts and interest rate swaps, see notes 10 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

Accounts Receivable, Net

At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $108.4 million in accounts receivable, net of allowances. The increase of $20.9 million in accounts receivable
as compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in sales, particularly in the last month of the year. Our allowance for returns is $2.3 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease of $0.7 million is
comprised of $7.4 million in credits issued for stock balancing rights during 2004 partially offset by $6.7 million of provisions for returns recorded during 2004. The overall decrease in our allowance for returns is primarily due to a reduction in
packaged product inventory held by our distributors. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is $2.6 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease of $0.7 million is comprised of $2.7 million of uncollectible
accounts written off, net of recoveries, partially offset by $1.1 million of provisions for doubtful accounts recorded during the year and $0.9 million of provisions for doubtful accounts associated with accounts receivable acquired in our
Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions. From time to time, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises, governments and small and
medium-sized businesses. If the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, no distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of our
accounts receivable. For more information regarding significant customers see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

Convertible Subordinated Debentures

In March 1999, we sold $850 million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures, or the Debentures, due March 22,
2019, in a private placement. The Debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.25% and resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $291.9 million, net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of approximately $9.6
million. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a program authorizing us to repurchase up to $25 million of the Debentures in open market purchases. Additionally, in April 2002, the Board of Directors granted additional authority of $100
million to us to repurchase Debentures through private transactions, bringing the total repurchase authority to $125 million. The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase the Debentures allowed us to repurchase Debentures when market
conditions were favorable. As of December 31, 2003, 76,000 units of our Debentures representing $76.0 million in principal amount at maturity, had been repurchased under these programs for $29.9 million. On March 22, 2004, we redeemed all of the
outstanding Debentures for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $355.7 million. We used the proceeds from our held-to-maturity investments that matured on March 22, 2004 and cash on hand to fund the redemption. At the date of redemption,
we incurred a charge for the associated deferred debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2 million.

Stock Repurchase Program

As of December 31, 2004, our board of directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of $800 million. In February 2005, the Company’s board of directors authorized the
repurchase of an additional $200 million, increasing the total authority to $1 billion. The objective of our stock repurchase program is to manage actual and anticipated dilution and to improve shareholders’ return. At December 31, 2004,
approximately $42.0 million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock.

We are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, from time
to time, we have entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our stock repurchase program in order to lower our average cost to acquire shares. These programs
include terms that require us to make up front payments to a counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the period of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the
agreement. Delivery of stock under certain programs may be dependent on market conditions. Prior to June 2003, we sold



put warrants that entitled the holder of each warrant to sell to us, generally by physical delivery, one share of our common stock at a specified price. At
December 31, 2004 there were no put warrants outstanding.

We
expended an aggregate of $121.9 million and $123.9 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, net of premiums received, under all stock repurchase transactions. During 2004, we took delivery of a total of 4,458,740 shares of outstanding common
stock with an average per share price of $18.77; and during 2003, we took delivery of a total of 8,859,381 shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of $15.86. Some of these shares were received pursuant to prepaid programs.
Since inception of our stock repurchase programs, the average cost of shares acquired was $16.55 per share compared to an average close price during open trading windows of $19.83 per share. In addition, a significant portion of the funds used to
repurchase stock was funded by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. We remain committed to our ongoing stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2004, we have remaining prepaid notional amounts of
approximately $53.1 million under our stock repurchase agreements. As the total shares to be received for the open repurchase agreements at December 31, 2004 is not determinable until the contracts mature in 2005, the above price per share amounts
exclude the remaining shares to be received subject to the agreements.

Historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. We currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2005. We believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from
operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related
to our strategic objectives. We could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement

Contractual Obligations

We have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease
obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 and the future periods in which
such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements (in thousands):

(1)

Total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellation without payment provisions exist.

As of December 31, 2004, we did not have any individually material
long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, purchase obligations, or other material long-term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement

During 2002, we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately $61.0 million for our corporate headquarters office space in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease represents a form of off-balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded 100% of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us. The synthetic lease qualifies as an
operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes. We do



not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Consequently, payments made pursuant
to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements. We do
not materially rely on off-balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources. For information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see “— Contractual Obligations.”

The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years. Upon approval by the
lessor, we can renew the lease twice for additional two-year periods. The lease payments vary based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin. At any time during the lease term, we have the option to sublease the property and
upon thirty days’ written notice, we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately $61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed.
Upon at least 180 days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term, we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party. If we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a
residual value to the lessor of approximately $51.9 million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor. On a periodic basis, we evaluate the property for indications of permanent impairment. If an evaluation were to indicate that
the fair value of the property were to decline below $51.9 million, we would be responsible for the difference under our residual value guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

The synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants
including a requirement for us to maintain a restricted balance of approximately $62.8 million as collateral, which is classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We maintain the ability
to manage the composition of restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes. Additionally, we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment
balance, collateralized investments and equity investments, of $100.0 million, as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $316.7 million in cash and investments in excess of this required level. The synthetic
lease includes non-financial covenants, including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property. As
of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs
a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No.
46 (revised), which replaced FIN No. 46. FIN No. 46 (revised) was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for
other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor, the leased facility or the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance
with FIN No. 46 (revised). Accordingly, there was no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of
other properties that it currently holds, we could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt in a future period.

Commitments

Capital expenditures were $24.4 million during 2004, $11.1 million during 2003 and $19.1 million during 2002. During 2004, capital expenditures were
primarily related to computer equipment purchases associated with our research and development activities and leasehold improvements. The increase of $13.3 million in capital expenditures during 2004 compared to 2003 is due to expenditures in 2004
for purchases of computer equipment related to existing and new research and development projects and leasehold improvements on renovations to currently occupied buildings. In the normal course of business, we enter into commitments related to
capital expenditures, however, we currently have no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures over the next 12 months.

During 2002 and 2001, we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices, including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of
certain leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to 2025 with a total remaining obligation at December 31, 2004 of approximately $22.5 million, of which $3.0 million was accrued for as of December
31, 2004, and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our



consolidated financial statements. In calculating this accrual, we made estimates, based on market information, including the estimated vacancy periods and
sublease rates and opportunities. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates; and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated, the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher.

Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results

Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and
could in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors. From time to time, information provided by us or statements made by our employees contain “forward-looking” information that involves risks and uncertainties. In
particular, statements contained in this Form 10-K, and in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to statements concerning new products, product development and
offerings, Subscription Advantage, product and price competition, Citrix Online division, competition and strategy, product price and inventory, contingent consideration payments, deferred revenues, economic and market conditions, revenue
recognition, profits, growth of revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses, sales, marketing and support expenses, research and development expenses valuations of investments and derivative instruments, technology relationships, reinvestment or
repatriation of foreign earnings, gross margins, amortization expense and intangible assets, interest income, interest expense, impairment charges, anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements, cash inflows, contractual obligations
in-process research and development, advertising campaigns, tax rates, leasing and subleasing activities, acquisitions, stock repurchases, investment transactions, liquidity, litigation matters, intellectual property matters, distribution channels,
stock price, Advisor Rewards Program, third party licenses and potential debt or equity financings constitute forward-looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the Section 27 of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees. Our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and could in the future vary significantly from those stated
in any forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K, in the documents incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. Such factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our long sales cycle for enterprise-wide sales could cause significant variability in
our revenue and operating results for any particular period.

In recent quarters, a growing number of our large and medium-sized customers have decided to implement our enterprise customer license arrangements on a department or enterprise-wide basis. Our long sales cycle for these large-scale
deployments makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur, and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis.

We have a long sales cycle for these enterprise-wide sales because:

•

our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large-scale deployment of our product to potential and existing customers prior to sale;

•

our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services;

•

our customers are typically large and medium size organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures
for software infrastructure; and

•

before making a purchase, our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations, and this process can be lengthy.

The continued long sales cycle for these
large-scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period.



We face intense competition, which could result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and margins.

We compete in intensely competitive markets. Some of
our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do.

For example, our ability to market the Citrix MetaFrame product line, and its individual products including: Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server, Citrix
MetaFrame Secure Access Manager, Citrix MetaFrame Conferencing Manager and Citrix MetaFrame Password Manager, and other future product offerings could be affected by Microsoft’s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices, servers and
applications. Further, the announcement of the release, and the actual release, of new Windows-based server operating systems or products incorporating similar features to our products could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or
cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future product and service offerings.

In addition, alternative products for secure, remote access in the Internet software and hardware markets directly and indirectly compete with our current Citrix MetaFrame product line and our Web-based desk-top
access products and services, including GoToAssist, GoToMyPC and GoToMeeting and anticipated future product and service offerings.

Existing or new products and services that extend Internet software and hardware to provide Web-based information and application access or interactive
computing can materially impact our ability to sell our products and services in this market. Our current competitors in this market include Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Webex Communications, Inc.,
Symantec Corporation, and other makers of secure remote access solutions.

As the markets for our products and services continue to develop, additional companies, including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware, software and networking industries could enter the
markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins,
which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Sales of products within our MetaFrame product line constitute a substantial majority of our revenue.

We anticipate that sales of products within our MetaFrame product line and related enhancements will constitute a substantial majority of our revenue for
the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue to generate revenue from our MetaFrame product line will depend on market acceptance of Windows Server Operating Systems and/or UNIX Operating Systems. Declines in demand for our MetaFrame products
could occur as a result of:

•

new competitive product releases and updates to existing products;

•

price competition;

•

technological change;

•

decreasing or stagnant information technology spending levels;

•

general economic conditions; or

•

lack of success of entities with which we have a strategic or technology relationship.

If our customers do not continue to purchase our MetaFrame products as a result of these or other factors, our revenue would
decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.



If we do not develop new products and services or enhancements to our existing products and services, our business,
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The markets for our products and services are characterized by:

•

rapid technological change;

•

evolving industry standards;

•

fluctuations in customer demand;

•

changes in customer requirements; and

•

frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements.

Our future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and services and develop and introduce new products and services
that our customers choose to buy. If we are unable to keep pace with technological developments and customer demands by introducing new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services, our business, results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our future success could be hindered by:

•

delays in our introduction of new products and services;

•

delays in market acceptance of new products and services or new releases of our current products and services; and

•

our, or a competitor’s, announcement of new product or service enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing product and service
offerings.

For example, we cannot guarantee that
our access infrastructure software will achieve the broad market acceptance by our channel and entities with which we have a strategic or technology relationship, customers and prospective customers necessary to generate significant revenue. In
addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others. If we experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to our new products and services or new
releases of our current products and services, those delays or shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business could be adversely impacted by the failure to renew our agreements with Microsoft for source code access.

In December 2004, we entered into a five-year
technology collaboration and licensing agreement with Microsoft Corporation or Microsoft. The arrangement includes a new technology initiative for closer collaboration on terminal server functionality in future server operating systems, continued
access to source code for key components of Microsoft’s current and future server operating systems, and a patent cross-licensing agreement. This technology collaboration and licensing agreement replaces the agreement we signed with Microsoft
in May 2002, that provided us access to Microsoft Windows Server source code for current and future Microsoft server operating systems, including access to Windows Server 2003 and terminal services source code. There can be no assurances that our
current agreements with Microsoft will be extended or renewed by Microsoft after their respective expirations. In addition, Microsoft could terminate the current agreements before the expiration of the term for breach or upon a change in our
control. The early termination or the failure to renew certain terms of these agreements with Microsoft in a manner favorable to us could negatively impact the timing of our release of future products and enhancements.

Our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information
technology market.

The demand for our products and
services depends substantially upon the general demand for business-related computer hardware and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending levels, the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective
customers and general economic conditions. Fluctuations in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the past, adverse economic conditions
decreased demand for our products and negatively impacted our financial results.



Future economic projections for the IT sector are uncertain. If an uncertain IT spending environment
persists, it could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The anticipated benefits to us of acquiring Expertcity may not be realized.

We acquired Expertcity, now known as Citrix Online in February 2004, with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits including,
among other things, enhanced revenue and profits, greater market presence and development, and enhancements to our product portfolio and customer base. We expect that the acquisition will enhance our position in the access infrastructure market
through the combination of our technologies, products, services, distribution channels and customer contacts with those of Citrix Online, and will enable us to broaden our customer base to include individuals, professionals and small office/home
office customers as well as extend our presence in the enterprise access infrastructure market. We may not fully realize some of these benefits and the acquisition may result in the deterioration or loss of significant business. For example, if our
business or Citrix Online’s business fails to meet the demands of the marketplace, customer acceptance of the products and services of the combined companies could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
and financial condition. Costs incurred and potential liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition also could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

Achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the
integration of Citrix Online’s and our businesses in a timely and efficient manner. The challenges involved in this integration include difficulties integrating Citrix Online’s operations, technologies and products as well as coordinating
the efforts of Citrix Online’s sales organization with our larger and more widely dispersed sales organization. Although the integration of the two businesses is ongoing, it is still complex, time consuming and expensive, disruptive to our
business and may result in the loss of customers or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic
goals we anticipate at the time of an acquisition.

Our growth is dependent upon market growth, our ability to enhance existing products and services, and our ability to introduce new products and services on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products
and services and enhance existing products and services through acquisitions of other companies, product lines and/or technologies.

Acquisitions, including those of high-technology companies, are inherently risky. We cannot assure anyone that our previous acquisitions or any future
acquisitions will be successful in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals either for that acquisition or for us generally. The risks we commonly encounter are:

•

difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, and products of the acquired companies;

•

undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third-party’s code in products of the acquired companies;

•

the risk of diverting management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;

•

potential difficulties in completing products associated with purchased in-process research and development;

•

risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;

•

the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and

•

an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company, which could unexpectedly dilute our earnings.

These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. We cannot guarantee that the combined company resulting from any acquisition can continue to support the growth achieved by



the companies separately. We must also focus on our ability to manage and integrate any acquisition. Our failure to manage growth effectively and
successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect our business and operating results.

If we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets, including technology purchased in acquisitions, are impaired, we would be required to take a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

We have a
significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, such as product and core technology, related to our acquisition of Sequoia Software Corporation in 2001 and Expertcity and Net6 in 2004. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets
that are deemed to have indefinite lives. However, we do amortize certain product and core technologies, trademarks, patents and other intangibles. We periodically evaluate our intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment. As of December
31, 2004 we had $361.5 million of goodwill. We review for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount
rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that
the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

At December 31, 2004, we had $87.2 million, net, of unamortized identified
intangibles with estimable useful lives, of which $5.6 million consists of core technology we purchased in the acquisition of Sequoia, $22.1 million relates to product and core technology purchased in the Expertcity acquisition, $13.3 million
relates to product and core technology purchased in the Net6 acquisition and $16.8 million represents core technology purchased under third party licenses. We have commercialized and currently market the Sequoia and other licensed technology through
our secure access infrastructure software, which includes Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access Manager and Citrix MetaFrame Password Manager. We currently market the technologies acquired in the Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions through our Citrix Online
and Citrix Gateway divisions. However, our channel distributors and entities with which we have technology relationships, customers or prospective customers may not purchase or widely accept our new line of products and services. If we fail to
complete the development of our anticipated future product offerings, if we fail to complete them in a timely manner, or if we are unsuccessful in selling these new products and services, we could determine that the value of the purchased technology
is impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to earnings. We could also incur additional charges in later periods to reflect costs associated with completing those projects that could not be completed in a timely manner. If the actual revenues
and operating profit attributable to acquired product and core technologies are less than the projections we used to initially value product and core technologies when we acquired it, such intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired. If we
determine that any of our intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We recorded approximately $216.6 million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of Expertcity
and $53.8 million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of Net6. If the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired intangible assets are less than the projections we used to initially value these
intangible assets when we acquired them, then these intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired. If we determine that any of the goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of Expertcity or Net6 are impaired, then we
would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off completely by taking a related charge to earnings. If we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of those assets, or if financial analysts or investors
believe we may need to take such action in the future, our stock price and operating results could be materially adversely affected.

If we fail to manage our operations and grow revenue or fail to continue to effectively control expenses, our future operating results could be adversely affected.

Historically, the scope of our operations, the number
of our employees and the geographic area of our operations and our revenue have grown rapidly. In addition, we have acquired both domestic and international companies. This growth and the assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could
continue to place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. To manage our growth, if any, effectively, we need to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls. We may
not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities for our products and services in a timely and cost-effective way. Our future operating results could also depend on our
ability to manage:



•

our expanding product line;

•

our marketing and sales organizations; and

•

our client support organization as installations of our products increase.

In addition, to the extent our revenue grows, if at all, we believe that our cost of revenues and certain operating expenses could also increase. We
believe that we could incur additional costs and royalties as we develop, license or buy new technologies or enhancements to our existing products and services. These added costs and royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating
expenses. However, we cannot currently quantify the costs for such transactions that have not yet occurred. In addition, we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and investments or issue additional shares of our common stock to fund
these additional costs.

We attribute most of our growth during
recent years to the introduction of the MetaFrame software for Windows operating systems in mid-1998. We cannot assure you that the access infrastructure software market, in which we operate, will grow. We cannot assure you that the release of our
access infrastructure software suite of products or other new products will increase our revenue growth rate.

We cannot assure you that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual revenues in any given quarter. If we experience a shortfall in
revenue in any given quarter, we likely will not be able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response. Any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter. Also, due to
the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current expectation for revenue growth, our income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities could be lower than in recent years.

We could change our licensing programs, which could negatively impact the timing of our
recognition of revenue.

We continually re-evaluate
our licensing programs, including specific license models, delivery methods, and terms and conditions, to market our current and future products and services. We could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances, for which we would
recognize licensing fees over a longer period. Changes to our licensing programs, including the timing of the release of enhancements, discounts and other factors, could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products, related
enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

As our international sales and operations grow, we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the United States. During 2004, we
derived approximately 53% of our revenues from sales outside the United States. Our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations. To successfully expand international sales, we must establish
additional foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international operations.
These risks include:

•

compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements;

•

variability of foreign economic, political and labor conditions;

•

changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by United States export laws;

•

longer accounts receivable payment cycles;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences;

•

difficulties in protecting intellectual property; and



•

burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

•

as we generate cash flow in non-U.S. jurisdictions, if necessary, we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner.

Our results of operations are also subject to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impacts on our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. As a result of
this practice, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk. Because the dollar was generally weak in 2004, operating expenses are higher in 2005, but further dollar weakness in 2005 will not have an additional material impact on our operating
expenses until 2006.

Our success depends, in part, on our
ability to anticipate and address these risks. We cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results.

Our proprietary rights could offer only limited protection. Our products could infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which could result in material
costs.

Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights
may not be successful. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary rights. The loss of any material trade secret,
trademark, trade name, patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business. Despite our precautions, it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or to
otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, we may not remain competitive. Any patents owned by us could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any
of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope we seek, if at all, and if issued, may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage.

In addition, our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected
by:

•

Differences in International Law; Enforceability of Licenses. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the
United States and Canada. For example, we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our packaged products under “shrink wrap” or “click-to-accept” license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic
enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically, all of which could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our products.

•

Third Party Infringement Claims. As we expand our product lines, the number of products and competitors in our industry segments increase and the functionality of these products
overlap, we could become increasingly subject to infringement claims and claims to the unauthorized use of a third-party’s code in our products. Companies and inventors are more frequently seeking to patent software and business methods because
of developments in the law that could extend the ability to obtain such patents. As a result, we could receive more patent infringement claims. Responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, could result in costly litigation;
injunctive relief or require us to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of those third parties. Licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, on terms compatible with the protection of our proprietary rights, or at all. In addition,
attention to these claims could divert our management’s time and attention from developing our business. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We are subject to risks associated with our strategic and technology relationships.

Our business depends on strategic and technology relationships. We cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in the future. In addition to
our relationship with Microsoft, we rely on strategic or technology relationships with such companies as SAP, International Business Machines Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, Dell Inc. and others. We depend on the entities with which we have
strategic or technology relationships to successfully test our products, to



incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell those products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current
strategic and technology relationships or to develop additional strategic and technology relationships. If any entities in which we have a strategic or technology relationship are unable to incorporate our technology into their products or to market
or sell those products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

If we lose access to third party licenses, releases of our products could be delayed.

We believe that we will continue to rely, in part, on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our products. Third
party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:

•

undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person’s code in the third party’s software;

•

disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable; and

•

infringement actions brought by third party licensees;

•

termination or expiration of the license.

If we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third party licenses, it could
delay the release of our products. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The market for our Web-based training and customer assistance products is volatile, and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our Citrix
Online division will be harmed.

The market for our
Web-based training and customer assistance products is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success with our Citrix Online division will depend to a
substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of application services in general and for GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting and GoToAssist, in particular. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and
financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to application services. Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use application
services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of application services,
then the market for these services may not further develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our Citrix Online division.

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain and further
penetrate large enterprise customers.

We must retain
and continue to expand our ability to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting services. Our inability to attract and retain large enterprise customers could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles, which could negatively impact our revenues. By granting special
pricing, such as bundled pricing or discounts, to these large customers, we may have to defer recognition of some portion of the revenue from such sales. This deferral could reduce our revenues and operating profits for a given reporting period.
Additionally, as we attempt to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers, we may need to increase corporate branding and marketing activities, which could increase our operating expenses. These efforts may not proportionally increase our
operating revenues and could reduce our profits.

Our success may depend
on our ability to attract and retain small-sized customers.

In order to successfully attract new customer segments to our MetaFrame products and expand our existing relationships with enterprise customers, we must reach and retain small-sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger
enterprise customers. We have begun a marketing initiative to reach these customers that includes extending our Advisor Rewards program to include a broader range of license types. We cannot guarantee that our small-sized customer marketing



initiative will be successful. Our failure to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, as we attempt to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers, we may
need to increase corporate branding and broaden our marketing activities, which could increase our operating expenses. These efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits.

Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and diversify our
distribution channels.

We currently intend to
continue to expand our distribution channels by leveraging our relationships with independent hardware and software vendors and system integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute our products. In addition, an integral part of our
strategy is to diversify our base of channel relationships by adding more channel members with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers. This will require additional resources, as we will need to expand our internal sales and service coverage
of these customers. If we fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our distribution channels, our business could be adversely affected. In addition to this diversification of our base, we will need to maintain a healthy mix of channel
members who cater to smaller customers. We may need to add and remove distribution members to maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of our products, which could increase our operating expenses. Through our accessPARTNER network,
Citrix Authorized Learning Centers and other programs, we are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to develop these channels, which could reduce our profits.

We rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not
control.

We rely significantly on independent
distributors and resellers to market and distribute our products. We do not control our distributors and resellers. Additionally, our distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products and could also represent other lines of products.
Some of our distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged products for resale to smaller end-users. If distributors and resellers reduce their inventory of our packaged products, our business could be adversely affected. Further,
we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors. The financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations. Any
significant delays or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our products could contain errors that could delay the release of new products and may not be detected until after our products are shipped.

Despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers,
our products, especially new products or releases, could contain errors. In some cases, these errors may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been made. Errors in our products could delay the development or release of new products
and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. Additionally, our products depend on third party products, which could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless. Because our products are
often used in mission-critical applications, errors in our products or the products of third parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers.

Our synthetic lease is an off-balance sheet arrangement that could negatively affect
our financial condition and results.

In April 2002,
we entered into a seven-year synthetic lease with a lessor for our headquarters office buildings in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, so
we do not include the property or the associated lease debt on our consolidated balance sheet. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(revised), which was effective immediately for certain
disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We have
determined that we were not required to consolidate the lessor entity, the leased facility or the related debt upon adopting of FIN No. 46 (revised). Accordingly, there was no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows
from adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of our property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds, we could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt at
that time.



If we elect not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a minimum
residual value of approximately $51.9 million to the lessor. Therefore, if the fair value of the property declines below $51.9 million, our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to the lessor, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

If
our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our Citrix Online division customers’ data, our services may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our service.

Use of our GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting or GoToAssist services involves the storage
and transmission of customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action,
employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our online customers’ data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
If any compromises of security were to occur, it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the Web for commerce and communications. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause
interruptions in our services or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses, software programs that disable or impair computers, have been distributed and have
rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or suppliers, which could disrupt our network or make it inaccessible to our Citrix Online division customers. If an actual or
perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers for our Citrix Online division, which would significantly adversely affect our
financial condition and the operating results for our Citrix Online division.

Evolving regulation of the Web may adversely affect our Citrix Online division.

As Web commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased
regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our online customers’ ability to use and share data and
restricting our ability to store, process and share data with these customers. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Web or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Web may also be
imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Web use or restricting information exchange over the Web could result in a decline in the use of the Web and the viability of Web-based services, which would significantly adversely affect our
financial condition and the operating results for our Citrix Online division.

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, we may not be able to fund our operations and fulfill our future obligations.

Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operations and product development, including the
payment of cash consideration in acquisitions and the payment of our other obligations, depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to liquidate our investments, repatriate cash and investments held in our overseas subsidiaries, sell assets or raise equity or debt financings when needed or desirable. An inability to
fund our operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further information, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

If we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.

Our success depends, in large part, upon the services of a number of key employees. Except for certain key employees of
acquired businesses, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel. Any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The effective management of our growth, if any, could depend upon
our ability to retain our highly skilled technical, managerial, finance and marketing personnel. If any of those employees leave, we will need to attract and retain replacements for them. We also need to add key personnel in the future.



The market for these qualified employees is competitive. We could find it difficult to successfully
attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in sufficient numbers. Furthermore, we may hire key personnel in connection with our future acquisitions; however, any of these employees will be able to terminate his or her
relationship with us at any time. If we cannot retain and add the necessary staff and resources for these acquired businesses, our ability to develop acquired products, markets and customers could be adversely affected. Also, we may need to hire
additional personnel to develop new products, product enhancements and technologies. If we cannot add the necessary staff and resources, our ability to develop future enhancements and features to our existing or future products could be delayed. Any
delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to obtain approval from our shareholders of new stock plans could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.

Several of our stock plans terminate in 2005. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has recommend to our shareholders the
approval of new stock plans for the issuance of stock options and other forms of equity-based compensation to our employees, officers and directors. We may not be able to secure approval for these new stock plans from our shareholders. If we do not
get such approvals, we will be forced to curtail our stock option issuances, which will adversely impact our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates.

If stock balancing returns or price adjustments exceed our reserves, our operating results could be adversely affected.

We provide most of our distributors with stock
balancing return rights, which generally permit our distributors to return products to us by the forty-fifth day of a fiscal quarter, subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter. We
also provide price protection rights to most of our distributors. Price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products within a
specified time period. To cover our exposure to these product returns and price adjustments, we establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current marketing plans. However, we cannot assure you that our reserves will
be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price adjustments. If we inadequately forecast reserves, our operating results could be adversely affected.

Our stock price could be volatile, and you could lose the value of your investment.

Our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date.
The trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Your investment in our stock could lose value. Some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include:

•

actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results;

•

analyst reports or recommendations;

•

changes in interest rates; and

•

other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.

The stock market in general, The Nasdaq National Market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations. These broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

Our business and investments could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic
political and social conditions.

General economic and
market conditions, and other factors outside our control including terrorist and military actions, could adversely affect our business and impair the value of our investments. Any further downturn in general economic conditions could result in a
reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business. These conditions make it difficult for us, and our customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an economic downturn could result in an impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to record losses related to such investments. Impairment in the value of these
investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management. As



of December 31, 2004, we had $479.9 million of short and long-term investments, including restricted investments, with various issuers and financial
institutions. In many cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of these investments. Fluctuations in economic and market conditions could adversely
affect the value of our investments, and we could lose some of our investment portfolio. A total loss of an investment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For further information on these investments, please
refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The following discussion about our market risk includes “forward-looking statements” that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could
differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events, gains or losses.

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. To mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk, we utilize derivative financial instruments. The counter-parties to our
derivative instruments are major financial institutions. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2004. Actual results could differ materially.

Discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities
are included in notes 2 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

Exposure to Exchange Rates

A substantial
majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies, including Euros, British pounds sterling, Swiss francs, Australian dollars and Japanese yen. To reduce exposure to reduction in U.S. dollar value
and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a hedging program. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures. Our hedging program
significantly reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of $39.0 million and $37.2 million,
respectively, and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of $165.0 million and $160.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, these contracts had an aggregate fair value of $8.0 million and $7.9 million,
respectively. Based on a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2004 market rates the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by $13.3 million. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% depreciation of
the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2004 market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by $13.3 million. Foreign operating costs in these hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction. This
calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above, changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value
of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of these
forward foreign exchange contracts.

Exposure to Interest Rates

We have interest rate exposures resulting from our
interest-based available-for-sale securities. In order to better manage our exposure to interest rate risk, we are a party to 19 interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of $182.4 million convert the
fixed rate return on certain of our available-for-sale securities, to a floating rate. The aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2004 was an asset of $1.1 million. Based upon a hypothetical 1% increase in the market
interest rate as of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these aggregated assets would have increased by approximately $4.2 million. Based on a hypothetical 1% decrease in the market interest rate as of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these
aggregated liabilities would have increased by approximately $4.2 million. The underlying assets would experience offsetting gains and losses. We also maintain available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments in debt securities, which limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer, or type of instrument. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged. The securities classified as available-for-sale are subject to interest rate risk. The modeling technique used
measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income. If market interest rates were to increase
by 100 basis points from December 31, 2004 and 2003 levels, the fair value of the available-for-sale portfolio would decline by approximately $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively. This sensitivity analysis on our available-for-sale portfolio
excludes the underlying investments to our 19 interest rate swaps



discussed above, as the interest rate risk related to those investments has been effectively hedged. For more information see note 13 to our consolidated
financial statements.

These amounts are determined by
considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our interest rate swap agreements and available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment portfolios. This analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the
reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.

In April 2002, we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately $61.0 million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters. Payments under this synthetic lease are
indexed to a variable interest rate (LIBOR plus a margin). Based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at December 31, 2004, a 100 basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial
position and results of operations. In addition to interest rate exposure, if the fair value of our headquarters building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida were to significantly decline, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULES

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial statement schedule, together with the reports of independent registered public
accounting firm, appear at pages F-1 through F-33 of this Form 10-K.

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

There have been no changes in or disagreements with our independent registered public accountants on accounting or financial disclosure matters during the
Company’s two most recent fiscal years.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s President and Chief
Executive Officer and the Company’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, including
ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended December 31, 2004, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a – 15(f). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding
the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, our management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness or our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Citrix Systems, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Citrix Systems, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Citrix Systems Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Citrix Systems, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Citrix Systems, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Citrix Systems, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Citrix Systems, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citrix Systems, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Citrix Systems, Inc. at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Citrix Systems, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March
10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    ORGANIZATION

Citrix
Systems, Inc. (“Citrix” or the “Company”), is a Delaware corporation founded on April 17, 1989. The Company designs, develops and markets access infrastructure software, services and appliances. The Company markets and licenses
its products through multiple channels such as value-added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators, independent software vendors and its websites, managed by the Company’s. The Company also promotes its products through
relationships with a wide variety of industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”).

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation Policy

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and
Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific. All significant transactions and balances between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004 and 2003 include marketable securities, which are primarily municipal securities, money market funds,
corporate securities, commercial paper and government securities with initial or remaining contractual maturities when purchased of three months or less. The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by investing
primarily in investment grade, highly liquid instruments and periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institutions.

Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments

Restricted cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2004 and 2003 include approximately $62.8 million in investment securities and cash
equivalents were pledged as collateral for specified obligations under the Company’s synthetic lease arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2004 and 2003 approximately $86.3 million and $83.6 million, respectively, in investment securities
were pledged as collateral for certain of the Company’s credit default contracts and interest rate swaps. The Company maintains the ability to manage the composition of the restricted cash equivalents and investments within certain limits and
to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the restricted collateral for operating purposes. For further information, see Notes 10 and 13.

Investments

Short and long-term investments at December 31, 2004 and 2003 primarily consist of corporate securities, government securities, commercial paper and
municipal securities. Investments classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are stated at
amortized cost. The Company does not recognize changes in the fair value of held-to-maturity investments in income unless a decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.

The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with investments by investing primarily in investment grade, highly liquid
securities. The Company maintains investments with various financial institutions and the Company’s policy is designed to limit exposure to any one issuer depending on credit quality. Periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of
those issuers are considered in the Company’s investment strategy. The Company uses information provided by third parties to adjust the carrying value of certain of its investments and derivative instruments to fair value at the end of each
period. Fair values are based on valuation models that use market quotes and, for certain investments, assumptions as to the creditworthiness of the entities issuing those underlying investments.

Substantially all of the Company’s accounts receivable are due from value-added resellers and distributors of computer software. Collateral is not
required. Credit losses and expected product returns are provided for in the consolidated financial statements and have historically been within management’s expectations. If the financial condition of a significant distributor or customer were
to deteriorate, the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected. No distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of gross accounts receivable at December 31, 2004 or 2003.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which is generally three years for computer equipment, software, office equipment and furniture, the lesser of the lease term or five years for leasehold improvements, seven years for the Company’s enterprise resource
planning system and 40 years for buildings. Depreciation expense was $21.2 million, $23.0 million and $30.1 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

During 2003, the Company retired $15.4 million in property and equipment that were no longer in use. At the time of retirement, these assets had no
remaining net book value and no asset retirement obligations associated with them. In 2004 retirements were not material.

Property and equipment consist of the following:

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangible assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted
future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. During 2004 and 2003, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated with its long-lived or intangible assets. During 2002, the
Company recognized $2.0 million in asset impairment charges primarily due to the consolidation of certain of its offices resulting in the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements. These charges are reflected in operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2002 and primarily related to the Americas geographic segment.

Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

The Company accounts for internal use software pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”)
No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

. Pursuant to SOP 98-1, the Company capitalizes external direct costs of materials and services used in the project and internal costs such as
payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software. The amount of costs capitalized in 2004 and 2003 relating to internal use software were $6.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, consisting of
purchased software and services provided by external vendors. These costs are being

F-9


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortized over the estimated useful life of the software developed, which is generally three to seven years and are included in property and equipment in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill

The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 142, requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test. At December 31, 2004
and 2003, the Company had $361.5 million and $152.4 million of goodwill, respectively. There was no impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003. Excluding goodwill, the
Company has no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives. Substantially all of the Company’s goodwill at December 31, 2004 was associated with the Americas and Citrix Online reportable segments and at December 31, 2003 substantially all
of the Company’s goodwill was associated with the Americas reportable segment. See Note 3 for acquisitions and Note 12 for segment information.

Intangible Assets

The Company has intangible assets with definite lives that are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to seven years, except for patents, which are amortized over 10 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed,

the Company records acquired core and product technology at net realizable value and reviews this technology for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology.
There has been no impairment of these assets for any of the periods presented.

Intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):

Amortization of core
and product technology was $6.1 million, $11.0 million and $10.8 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is classified as a component of cost of revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Amortization of other
intangible assets was $6.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Estimated future annual amortization expense is as follows (in thousands):

During 2004, the
Company reclassified certain acquired intangible assets to goodwill to adjust the purchase price allocation resulting from a 2001 acquisition. The adjustment resulted in a $4.4 million reduction of amortization expense, net of related tax effect of
$2.8 million in 2004.

Software Development Costs

SFAS No. 86 requires certain software development costs to be capitalized
upon the establishment of technological feasibility. The establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors
such as anticipated future revenue, estimated economic life, and changes in software and hardware technologies. Software development costs incurred beyond the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant.

Revenue Recognition

The Company markets and licenses software products primarily through value-added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators and independent
software vendors. The Company’s software licenses are generally perpetual. The Company also separately sells software license updates and services, which include product training, technical support and consulting services, as well as Web-based
desktop access services.

The Company’s packaged products
are typically purchased by medium and small-sized businesses with a minimal number of locations. In these cases, the software license is delivered with the packaged product. Electronic license arrangements are used with more complex multiserver
environments typically found in larger business enterprises that deploy the Company’s products on a department or enterprise-wide basis, which could require differences in product features and functionality at various customer locations. Once
the Company receives a software license agreement and purchase order, the enterprise customer licenses are electronically delivered. “Software activation keys” that enable the feature configuration ordered by the end-user are delivered
separate from the software. Software may be delivered indirectly by a channel distributor, via download from the Company’s website or directly to the end-user by the Company.

Revenue is recognized when it is earned. The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 97-2 (as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9) and related interpretations,

Software Revenue Recognition.

In addition, for the Company’s Web-based desktop access services revenue is recognized in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-3,

Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware.

The Company recognizes revenue when all
of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and the Company has no remaining obligations; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is probable. The Company defines these four
criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists. The Company recognizes revenue on packaged product upon shipment to distributors and resellers. For packaged product sales, it is the
Company’s customary practice to require a purchase order from distributors and resellers who have previously negotiated a master packaged product distribution or resale agreement. For electronic and paper license arrangements, the Company
typically requires a purchase order from the distributor, reseller or end-user (depending on the arrangement) and an executed software license agreement from the end-user. For technical support, product training and consulting services, the Company
requires a purchase order and an executed agreement. For Web-based desktop access services, the Company requires the customer or the reseller to electronically accept the terms of an online services agreement or execute a contract and generally
submit a purchase order.

•

Delivery has occurred and the Company has no remaining obligations. For software license sales, the Company’s standard delivery method is free-on-board shipping point.
Consequently, it considers delivery of packaged product to have occurred when the products are shipped pursuant to an agreement and purchase order. The Company considers delivery of licenses under electronic licensing agreements to have occurred
when the related products are shipped and the end-user has been electronically provided with the licenses and software activation keys that allow the end-user to take immediate possession of the software. For product training and consulting
services, the Company fulfills its obligation when the services are performed. For software license updates, technical support and Web-based desktop access services, the Company assumes that its obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective
terms of the agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable. In the normal course of business, the Company does not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees or extended
payment terms. The Company sells software license updates and services, which includes technical support, product training and consulting services, and Web-based desktop access services separately and it determines vendor specific objective evidence
(“VSOE”) of fair value by the price charged for each product when sold separately or applicable renewal rates.

•

Collectibility is probable. The Company determines collectibility on a customer-by-customer basis and generally does not require collateral. The Company typically
sells software licenses and updates to distributors or resellers for whom there are histories of successful collection. New customers are subject to a credit review process that

F-11


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

evaluates the their financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. Customers are also subject to an ongoing credit review process. If the Company
determines from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable, revenue recognition is deferred until customer payment is received and the other parameters of revenue recognition described above have been achieved.
Management’s judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information, historical experience and economic market conditions.

Net revenues include the following categories: Software Licenses, Software
License Updates and Services. Software Licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of our MetaFrame products. These revenues are reflected net of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return rights. Software License
Updates consists of fees related to the Subscription Advantage program (the Company’s terminology for post contract support) that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12-24 months. Subscription Advantage is a
renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades, enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of subscription. Services consist primarily of technical support
services and Web-based desktop access services revenue recognized ratably over the contract term, revenue from product training and certification, and consulting services revenue related to implementation of the Company’s software products,
which is recognized as the services are provided.

The Company
licenses most of its software products bundled with an initial subscription for software license updates that provide the end-user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis. Customers may also elect
to purchase technical support, product training or consulting services. The Company allocates revenue to software license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on VSOE of fair value of each element and such amounts are
deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria described above have been met. The balance of the revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is allocated to the delivered software product using
the residual method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the software licenses are delivered. If management cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on VSOE, revenue recognition is deferred until
all elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively determined.

In the normal course of business, the Company does not permit product returns, but it does provide most of its distributors and value added resellers with
stock balancing and price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to the Company by the forty-fifth day of the fiscal quarter, subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of the Company’s other products
prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter. Price protection rights require that the Company grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of products held by distributors or resellers if it lowers prices for such products. The Company
establishes provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of
factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by product, the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions.
Actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are, however, dependent upon future events, including the amount of stock balancing activity by distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of
any price adjustments. The Company continually monitors the factors that influence the pricing of its products and distributor inventory levels and makes adjustments to these provisions when it believes actual returns and other allowances could
differ from established reserves. The Company’s ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to distributors is predicated on its ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns. If actual experience or changes in market condition
impairs the Company’s ability to estimate returns, it would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end-user. Allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately $2.3 million at
December 31, 2004 and $3.0 million at December 31, 2003. The Company has not reduced and has no current plans to reduce its prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers. Accordingly, there were no reserves required for price
protection at December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003. The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume-based incentives. If market conditions were to decline, the Company could
take actions to increase its customer incentive offerings, which could result in an incremental reduction to revenue at the time the incentive is offered.

Product Concentration

The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from one software product and anticipates that this product and
future derivative products and product lines based upon this technology, if any, will constitute a majority of its revenue for the foreseeable future. The Company could experience declines in demand for products, whether as a result of general
economic conditions, new competitive product releases, price competition, lack of success of its strategic partners, technological change or other factors.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues consists primarily of compensation and other personnel-related costs of providing services and amortization of core and product
technology, as well as, costs of product media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials, shipping expense, service capacity costs and royalties. The Company is a party to licensing agreements with various entities, which give the Company the
right to use certain software code in its products or in the development of future products in exchange for the payment of a fixed fee or certain amounts based upon the sales of the related product. The licensing agreements generally have terms
ranging from one to five years, and generally include renewal options. However, some agreements may be perpetual unless expressly terminated. Royalties and other costs related to these agreements are included in cost of revenues.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of each of the Company’s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets
and liabilities of the subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are remeasured at average rates prevailing during the year. Remeasurement and foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of
approximately $1.7 million, $2.4 million and $(1.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

In accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,

and its related interpretations and amendments, the Company records derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. For derivatives that are designated as and
qualify as effective cash flow hedges, the portion of gain or loss on the derivative instrument effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into
earnings as operating income (expense) when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated as and qualify as effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings as interest income (expense) during the period of the change in fair values. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted
to fair value through earnings as other income (expense) in the period the changes in fair value occur. The application of the provisions of SFAS No. 133 could impact the volatility of earnings.

The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes attributing all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to floating rate assets or liabilities or
forecasted transactions and attributing all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to fixed rate assets or liabilities. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each
derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item. Fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the hedged item; however, if it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the affected derivative.

Advertising Expense

The Company expenses costs as incurred. The Company has cooperative advertising agreements with certain distributors and
resellers whereby the Company will reimburse distributors and resellers for qualified advertising of Citrix

F-13


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

products. The Company also has advertising agreements with, and purchases advertising from, online media providers to advertise its Web-based desktop access
products. Reimbursement is made once the distributor, reseller or provider provides substantiation of qualified expenditures. The Company estimates the impact of these expenses and recognizes them at the time of product sales as a component of
sales, marketing and support expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company recognized advertising expenses of approximately $35.2 million, $13.5 million and $10.0 million, during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company estimates income taxes based on rates in effect in each of the
jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to reverse. The realization of deferred tax assets is based on historical tax positions and expectations about future taxable income. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the
“not more likely than not” criteria of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Significant estimates made by management include the provision for doubtful accounts receivable, provision for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights, as well as other sales allowances, the valuation of
the Company’s goodwill, net realizable value of core and product technology, the provision for income taxes and the amortization and depreciation periods for intangible and long-lived assets. While the Company believes that such estimates are
fair when considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole, the actual amounts of such estimates, when known, will vary from these estimates.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

as amended by
SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation- Transition and Disclosure,

defines a fair value method of accounting for issuance of stock options and other equity instruments. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured
at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, companies are not required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee
stock-based transactions. Companies are permitted to account for such transactions under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

but are required to disclose in a note to the
consolidated financial statements pro forma net income and per share amounts as if a company had applied the fair methods prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its plans, stock options granted to employees and non-employee
directors and has complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. Except for non-employee directors, the Company has not granted any options to non-employees. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because the alternative
fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, that were developed for use with traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, as
opposed to employee stock options, which are typically non-transferable and last up to ten years. Currently, management believes there is not one agreed upon option valuation method that is comparable among all reporting companies. Specifically, the
Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including assumptions related to the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the option. Because the Company’s stock-based awards to employees have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing pricing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards to employees. Since the Black-Scholes model is based on statistical expectations, the calculation can result in substantial earnings volatility that may not agree, as to
timing or amount, with the actual gain or loss accrued or realized by the option holder.

F-14

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income except for amounts related to
the 51,546 options assumed as part of the Net6 acquisition, which were accounted for in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44,

Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25),

and was not material. Substantially all options granted under the Company’s six stock-based compensation plans, including plans assumed from acquired entities, have an exercise price equal to or above market value of the underlying common stock
on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for the grants issued at an exercise price equal to or above market value under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for grants
under those plans consistent with the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, the Company’s cash flows would have remained unchanged; however, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

For purposes of the
pro forma calculations, the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the following assumptions:

2004 Grants

2003 Grants

2002 Grants

Expected volatility factors

0.38 – 0.49

0.57 – 0.68

0.69

Approximate risk free interest rate

3.0% – 3.5%

2.5% – 3.0%

4.0%

Expected lives

3.32 – 4.76 years

4.70 – 4.75 years

4.60 years

The determination of
the fair value of all options is based on the above assumptions. Because additional option grants are expected to be made each year and forfeitures will occur when employees leave the Company, the above pro forma disclosures are not representative
of pro forma effects on reported net income (loss) for future years. See Note 6 for more information regarding the Company’s stock option plans.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of
certain stock options (calculated using the treasury stock method) and put warrants (calculated using the reverse treasury stock method). Certain shares under the Company’s stock-based compensation programs, and common stock potentially
issuable upon conversion of the Company’s convertible subordinated debentures were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect for the respective periods in which they were outstanding. The
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the earnings per share calculation is presented in Note 14.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of the prior years’ financial statements have been made to conform to the current year’s presentation.

3. ACQUISITIONS

On February 27, 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Expertcity.com, Inc. (“Expertcity”), a market
leader in Web-based desktop access, as well as a leader in Web-based training and customer assistance products. The consideration for this transaction was approximately $241.4 million, comprised of approximately $112.6 million in cash, approximately
5.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock valued at approximately $124.4 million and direct transactions costs of approximately $4.4 million. These amounts include additional common stock earned by Expertcity upon the achievement of
certain revenue and other financial milestones during 2004 pursuant to the merger agreement, which will be issued during 2005. The fair value of the common stock earned as additional purchase price consideration was recorded as goodwill on the date
earned. There is no further contingent consideration related to the transaction. The sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments and our authorized common stock.

On December 8, 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Net6, Inc. (“Net6”), a leader in secure access gateways. The acquisition extends the Company’s ability to provide easy and secure access to virtually any resource, both data and voice, on-demand. The consideration for
this transaction was approximately $49.2 million and was paid in cash. In addition to the purchase price, direct transaction costs associated with the acquisition were approximately $1.7 million.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price for each of
Expertcity and Net6 was allocated to Expertcity’s and Net6’s respective net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the respective acquisitions. Independent valuation
specialists conducted separate valuations to assist us in determining the fair values of a significant portion of Expertcity’s and Net6’s net assets.

The allocation of the purchase price is summarized below (in thousands):

The goodwill recorded
in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. Identifiable intangible assets purchased in the Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions and their weighted average lives are as follows:

The fair values used
in determining the purchase price allocation for certain intangible assets for Expertcity and Net6 were based on estimated discounted future cash flows, royalty rates and historical data, among other information. Purchased in-process research and
development (“IPR&D”) of approximately $19.1 million was expensed immediately upon closing of the respective mergers in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4,

Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2
to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method,

due to the fact that it pertains to

F-16


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

technology that was not currently technologically feasible, meaning it had not reached the working model stage, did not contain all of the major functions
planned for the product, was not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative future use. The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was determined using the income approach, which includes estimating the revenue and
expenses associated with a project’s sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after-tax cash flows attributable to the projects. The future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return,
which ranged from 17% to 25%. The rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the IPR&D.

The $165.8 million of goodwill related to the Expertcity acquisition was assigned to the Citrix Online division segment and
the $33.5 million of goodwill related to the Net6 acquisition was assigned to the Americas segment. See Note 12 for segment information.

The results of operations of Expertcity and Net6 are included in the Company’s results of operations beginning after their respective acquisition
dates. Expertcity is the Company’s new segment, the Citrix Online division and Net6 is part of the Company’s Americas reportable segment. The following unaudited pro forma information combines the consolidated results of operations of the
Company and Expertcity and Net6 as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2003 (in thousands, except per share data):

4. CASH AND INVESTMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents and investments consist of the
following:

F-17


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(1)

Includes investments in both United States and foreign government securities.

The Company had two AAA-rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as held-to-maturity investments that were carried at the combined accreted
value of approximately $192.5 million at December 31, 2003. These securities matured on March 22, 2004 and the Company received $195.4 million, all of which was used to redeem a portion of the Company’s convertible subordinated debentures. At
December 31, 2004, the Company held no investments classified as held-to-maturity.

The Company’s other short and long-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of securities during 2004 and 2003 were not
material. Gross realized gains and losses were $0.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2004, the average original contractual maturity of the Company’s short-term available-for-sale
investments was approximately 13 months. The Company’s long-term available-for-sale investments at December 31, 2004 include $253.6 million of investments, including restricted investments, with original contractual maturities ranging from one
to five years and $18.0 million of investments with original contractual maturities ranging from five to 10 years. The average remaining maturities of the Company’s short and long-term available-for-sale investments, including restricted
investments, at December 31, 2004 were five and 27 months, respectively. In addition, included in short-term available for sale investments are auction rate securities owned by the Company that generally reset every seven to 28 days. The Company
also owns $0.4 million in equity investments not due at a single maturity date classified as long-term investments.

The Company has investments in two instruments with an aggregate amount of $50.0 million that include structured credit risk features related to certain
referenced entities. Under the terms of these debt instruments, the Company assumes the default risk, above a certain threshold, of a portfolio of specific referenced issuers in exchange for a fixed yield that is added to the LIBOR-based yield on
the underlying debt instrument. In the event of default by the underlying referenced issuers above specified amounts, the Company will pay the counterparty an amount equivalent to its loss, not to exceed the face value of the instrument. The primary
risk associated with these investments is the default risk of the underlying issuers. The credit ratings of these instruments are equivalent to the likelihood of an event of default under “AAA” or “AA” rated individual
securities. The purpose of these instruments is to provide additional yield on certain of the Company’s available-for-sale investments. These instruments mature in November 2007 and February 2008. To date there have been no credit events for
the underlying referenced entities resulting in losses to the Company. The Company separately accounts for changes in the fair value of the structured credit features of the investments and as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there was no material
change in fair value.

The change in net unrealized securities
gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains (losses) that arose from changes in market value of securities that were held during the period and gains (losses) that were previously unrealized, but have been
recognized in current period net income due to sales or maturities of available-for-sale securities. This reclassification has no effect on total comprehensive income or stockholders’ equity and was immaterial for all periods presented. The
unrealized gain (loss) associated with each individual category of cash and investments was not significant for either of the periods presented.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following:

6. EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND
BENEFIT PLANS

Stock Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has six stock-based compensation
plans including plans assumed in acquisitions, which are described below. The Company typically grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the shares at the date of
grant. As mentioned in Note 2, the Company applies the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock plans and its
stock purchase plan except for 51,546 options assumed as part of the Net6 acquisition that had an exercise price below market value and were accounted for in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44,

Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25)

. The impact on the Company’s financial statements from the use of options is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution (see Note 14).

Fixed Stock Option Plans

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Plan (the “1995
Plan”) was originally adopted by the Board on September 28, 1995 and approved by the Company’s stockholders in October 1995. Under the terms of the 1995 Plan, the Company is authorized to grant incentive stock options (“ISOs”)
and non-qualified stock options (“NSOs”), make stock awards and provide the opportunity to purchase stock to employees, directors and officers and consultants of the Company. The 1995 Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of a
maximum of 69,945,623 shares of common stock, plus, effective January 1, 2001 and each year thereafter, a number of shares of common stock equal to 5% of the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31 of the
preceding year. Under the 1995 Plan, a maximum of 60,000,000 ISOs may be granted and ISOs must be granted at exercise prices no less than fair market value at the date of grant, except for ISOs granted to employees who own more than 10% of the
Company’s combined voting power, for which the exercise prices will be no less than 110% of the market value at the date of grant. NSOs, stock awards or stock purchases may be granted or authorized, as applicable, at prices no less than the
minimum legal consideration required. Under the 1995 Plan, as amended, stock options must be granted at exercise prices no less than market value at the date of grant; provided, however, that if an NSO is expressly granted in lieu of a reasonable
amount of salary or cash bonus, the exercise price may be equal to or greater than 85% of the fair market value at the date of such grant. ISOs and NSOs expire five or ten years from the date of grant depending on the applicable option agreement.
All options are exercisable upon vesting. Ten year options typically vest over four years at a rate of 25% of the shares underlying the option one year from the date of grant and at a rate of 2.08% monthly thereafter and five year options typically
vest over three years at a rate of 33.3% of the shares underlying the option one year from date of grant and at a rate of 2.78% monthly thereafter.

The Company’s Second Amended and Restated 2000 Director and Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2000 Plan”) was originally
adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the Company’s stockholders on May 18, 2000. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, the Company is authorized to make stock awards, provide eligible individuals with the opportunity to purchase stock,
grant ISOs and grant NSOs to officers and directors of the Company. The 2000 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares, plus, effective on January 1, 2001, on January 1 of each year, a number of shares of common stock equal to
one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the total number of shares of common stock issued and

outstanding as of December 31 of the preceding year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of stock options that may be issued pursuant to the
2000 Plan shall be equal to the maximum number of stock options issuable under the 2000 Plan at any time less 500,000 stock options, and no more than 3,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options
granted under the 2000 Plan. Under the 2000 Plan, stock options must be granted at exercise prices no less than market value at the date of grant, provided however, that if an NSO is expressly granted in lieu of a reasonable amount of salary or cash
bonus, the exercise price may be equal to or greater than 85% of the fair market value at the date of such grant. ISOs and NSOs expire ten or five years from date of grant depending on the applicable option agreement. All options are exercisable
upon vesting. Ten year options typically vest over four years at a rate of 25% of the shares underlying the option one year from the date of grant and at a rate of 2.08% monthly thereafter and five year options typically vest over three years at a
rate of 33.3% of the shares underlying the option one year from date of grant and at a rate of 2.78% monthly thereafter.

The Second Amended and Restated 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the “Director Option Plan”) was originally adopted by the Board of
Directors on September 28, 1995 and approved by the Company’s stockholders in October 1995. The Director Option Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase a maximum of 3,600,000 shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee
directors of the Company.

Pursuant to the Director Option
Plan, each non-employee director is eligible to receive an initial grant of an option to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock and an annual grant of an option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock on the first business day of the month
following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, provided that no annual grant shall be granted to any non-employee director in the same calendar year that such person received his or her initial grant. The initial grant vests 33.3% after the
conclusion of the first year and 2.78% per month over the remaining two years. The annual grant vests in equal monthly increments over a period of one year. All options granted under the Director Option Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the common stock on the date of grant and a term of five years from the date of grant. Options are exercisable to the extent vested only while the optionee is serving as a director of the Company or within 90 days after the optionee
ceases to serve as a director of the Company.

The
Company’s Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive Plan of Net6, Inc. (the “2000 Net6 Plan”) was originally adopted and approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders of Net6 on January 19, 2001. The 2000 Net6 Plan and the
outstanding unvested stock options under the 2000 Net6 Plan (the “2000 Assumed Options”) were assumed by the Company on December 8, 2004 in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Net6. Under the terms of the 2000 Net6 Plan, Net6
was authorized to grant ISOs and NSOs and to make stock awards to employees, directors, officers and consultants of Net6. The 2000 Net6 Plan, as amended and restated, provides for the issuance of a maximum of 167,850 (as adjusted for stock splits)
shares of common stock. As of December 8, 2004, however, the Company’s Board of Directors resolved to cap the 2000 Net6 Plan with 7,861 shares of the 2000 Assumed Options outstanding and to make no further option grants or stock awards under
the 2000 Net6 Plan. ISOs were granted at exercise prices no less than the fair market value at the date of grant, except for ISOs granted to employees who owned more than 10% of Net6’s combined voting power, for which the exercise prices were
no less than 110% of the market value at the date of grant. NSOs were granted at exercise prices no less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant. Stock awards were authorized at prices established by the Board of Directors of Net6.
ISOs and NSOs expire five or ten years from the original grant date depending on the applicable option agreement. All options are exercisable upon vesting. The 2000 Assumed Options generally vest over four years with 25% of the shares underlying the
option vesting one year from the original grant date and at a rate of 2.08% monthly thereafter.

The Company’s Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Incentive Plan of Net6, Inc. (the “2003 Net6 Plan”) was originally adopted and approved by
the Board of Directors and stockholders of Net6 on May 15, 2003. The 2003 Net6 Plan and the outstanding unvested stock options under the 2003 Net6 Plan (the “2003 Assumed Options”) were assumed by the Company on December 8, 2004 in
connection with the Company’s acquisition of Net6. Under the terms of the 2003 Net6 Plan, Net6 was authorized to grant ISOs and NSOs and to make stock awards to employees, directors, officers and consultants of Net6. The 2003 Net6 Plan, as
amended and restated, provides for the issuance of a maximum of 102,575 (as adjusted for stock splits) shares of common stock. As of December 8, 2004, however, the Company’s Board of Directors resolved to cap the 2003 Net6 Plan with 43,685
shares of the 2003 Assumed Options outstanding and to make no further option grants or stock awards under the 2003 Net6 Plan. ISOs were granted at exercise prices no less than the fair market value at the date of grant, except for ISOs granted to
employees who owned more than 10% of Net6’s combined voting power, for which the exercise prices were no less than 110% of the market value at the date of grant. NSOs were granted at

exercise prices established by the Board of Directors of Net6, provided that NSOs granted to certain Net6 officers were granted at no less than fair market
value at the date of grant. Stock awards were authorized at prices established by the Board of Directors of Net6, provided that stock awards made to certain Net6 officers were made at no less than fair market value at the date of award. ISOs and
NSOs expire five or ten years from the original grant date depending on the applicable option agreement. All options are exercisable upon vesting. The 2003 Assumed Options generally vest over four years with 25% of the shares underlying the option
vesting one year from the original grant date and at a rate of 2.08% monthly thereafter.

A summary of the status and activity of the Company’s fixed stock option plans is as follows:

Information about
stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2004 is as follows:

Stock Purchase Plan

The Third Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “1995 Purchase Plan”) was originally adopted by the Board of Directors on September 28, 1995 and approved by the Company’s stockholders in October 1995. The 1995 Purchase Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum
of 9,000,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of non-transferable options granted to participating employees. All U.S.-based employees of the Company whose customary employment is 20 hours or more per week and more than five months in any
calendar year, and employees of certain international subsidiaries, are eligible to participate in the 1995 Purchase Plan. Employees who would immediately after the grant own 5% or more of the Company’s common stock and directors who are not
employees of the Company, may not participate in the 1995 Purchase Plan. To participate in the 1995 Purchase Plan, an employee must authorize the Company to deduct an amount (not less than 1% nor more than 10% of a participant’s total cash
compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000) from his or her pay during six-month periods (each a “Plan Period”).

F-21


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock an employee may purchase in any Plan Period is 12,000
shares subject to certain other limitations. The exercise price for the option for each Plan Period is 85% of the lesser of the market price of the Common Stock on the first or last business day of the Plan Period. If an employee is not a
participant on the last day of the Plan Period, such employee is not entitled to exercise his or her option, and the amount of his or her accumulated payroll deductions are refunded. An employee’s rights under the 1995 Purchase Plan terminate
upon his or her voluntary withdrawal from the 1995 Purchase Plan at any time or upon termination of employment. In January 2002, the 1995 Purchase Plan was amended to change the Plan Periods to avoid automatic purchases of shares of Common Stock
from being made during the Company’s regular black-out periods. Under the 1995 Purchase Plan, the Company issued 299,498 shares, 473,002 shares and 248,027 shares in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Benefit Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) benefit plan (the “Plan”) allowing
eligible U.S.-based employees to contribute up to 60% of their annual compensation, limited to an annual maximum amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company, at its discretion, may contribute up to $0.50 of each dollar of
employee contribution, limited to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s annual compensation. The Company’s matching contributions for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $2.3 million and $2.0 million for both 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company’s contributions vest over a four-year period at 25% per year.

7. CAPITAL STOCK

Common Stock

The Company has reserved for future issuance 79,800,352
shares of common stock for the exercise of stock options outstanding or available for grant.

Stock Repurchase Programs

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to the Company of $1.0 billion, of which $200 million was authorized in February 2005, the objective of which
is to manage actual and anticipated dilution and improve shareholders’ return. At December 31, 2004, approximately $42.0 million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are
recorded as treasury stock.

The Company is authorized to make
open market purchases of its common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, from time to time, the Company has entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part
of its share repurchase program in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares. These programs include terms that require the Company to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during
or at the end of the period of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement, depending on market conditions. Prior to June 2003, the Company sold put warrants that entitled the holder of each warrant to sell
to the Company, generally by physical delivery, one share of its common stock at a specified price. At December 31, 2004 and 2003 there were no put warrants outstanding.

The Company expended an aggregate of $121.0 million, $123.9 million and $161.1 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, net of premiums received, under all stock repurchase transactions. During 2004, the Company took delivery of a total of 4,458,740 shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of $18.77; and during 2003, the
Company took delivery of a total of 8,859,381 shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of $15.86. Some of these shares were received pursuant to prepaid programs. Since the inception of the stock repurchase programs, the
average cost of shares acquired was $16.55 per share compared to an average close price during open trading windows of $19.83 per share. In addition, a significant portion of the funds used to repurchase stock was funded by proceeds from employee
stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has remaining prepaid notional amounts of approximately $53.1 million under structured stock repurchase agreements. Due to the fact that the total shares to be
received for the open repurchase agreements at December 31, 2004 is not determinable until the contracts mature in 2005, the above price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares to be received subject to the agreements.

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. The Company has no present plans to issue such shares.

8. CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

In March 1999, the Company sold $850 million principal amount at maturity of
its zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”) due March 22, 2019, in a private placement. The Debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.25% and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately
$291.9 million, net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of approximately $9.6 million. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25 million of the Debentures in open
market purchases. Additionally, in April 2002, the Board of Directors granted additional authority of $100 million to the Company to repurchase Debentures through private transactions, bringing the total repurchase authority to $125 million. The
Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase the Debentures allowed the Company to repurchase Debentures when market conditions were favorable. Through December 31, 2003, 76,000 units of the Company’s Debentures representing $76.0
million in principal amount at maturity, had been repurchased under these programs for $29.9 million. On March 22, 2004, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding Debentures for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $355.7 million. The
Company used the proceeds from its held-to-maturity investments that matured on March 22, 2004 and cash on hand to fund the redemption. At the date of redemption, the Company incurred a charge for the write-off of the associated deferred debt
issuance costs of approximately $7.2 million.

9. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these items. The Company’s investments classified as available-for-sale securities, including restricted
investments, are carried at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based primarily on quoted market prices for such financial instruments. The aggregate fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments was $479.6
million and $512.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company’s held-to-maturity investments had a carrying value of $192.5 million at December 31, 2003, and an aggregate fair value of $194.5 million at December 31, 2003
based on dealer quotation. The carrying amount of the Company’s Debentures at December 31, 2003 was $351.4 million and the fair value of the Debentures, based on the quoted market price as of December 31, 2003 was approximately $355.9 million.

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases certain office space and equipment under various
operating leases. In addition to rent, the leases require the Company to pay for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. Certain of these leases contain stated escalation clauses while others contain renewal options. The Company
recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, excluding renewal periods, unless renewal of the lease is reasonably assured.

Rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled approximately $18.0 million, $16.4 million and $24.4 million, respectively.
Rental expense for 2002 includes lease losses associated with the vacancy of certain of the Company’s leased properties, as discussed below. Sublease income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $1.6 million,
$2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Lease commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year and sublease income associated with non-cancelable subleases, including estimated future
payments under the Company’s synthetic lease arrangement, are as follows:

F-23


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2002, the
Company became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately $61.0 million for its corporate headquarters office space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease represents a form of off-balance sheet financing under which an
unrelated third party lessor funded 100% of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to the Company. The synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes. The Company
does not include the property or the related lease debt as an asset or a liability in its consolidated balance sheets. Consequently, payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements
of income. The Company entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease its headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under its previous lease arrangements.

The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years. Upon approval by the lessor, the Company can renew the lease twice
for additional two-year periods. The lease payments vary based on LIBOR plus a margin. At any time during the lease term, the Company has the option to sublease the property and upon thirty-days’ written notice, the Company has the option to
purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately $61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed. Upon at least 180 days notice prior to the termination of the
initial lease term, the Company has the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party. If the Company chooses not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, it has guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately
$51.9 million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates the property for indicators of impairment. If an evaluation were to indicate that fair value of the building were to decline
below $51.9 million, the Company would be responsible for the difference under its residual value guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a
requirement for the Company to maintain a pledged balance of approximately $62.8 million in cash and/or investment securities as collateral. This amount is included in restricted cash equivalents and investments in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. The Company maintains the ability to manage the composition of the restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the restricted collateral for operating purposes. Additionally,
the Company must maintain a minimum cash and investment balance of $100.0 million, excluding the Company’s collateralized investments and equity investments as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
approximately $316.7 million in cash and investments in excess of this required level. The synthetic lease includes non-financial covenants, including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of financial statements to
the lender of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,

which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised). FIN No. 46 (revised) was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to
as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for all types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The Company determined that it was not required to consolidate the lessor, the
leased facility or the related debt upon the adoption of FIN No. 46 (revised). Accordingly, there was no impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of the
property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds, the Company could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt in a future period.

F-24


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2002 and 2001, the Company took actions to consolidate certain of its offices, including the
exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to 2025 with a total remaining obligation at December 31, 2004 of approximately $22.5
million, of which $3.0 million was accrued for as of December 31, 2004, and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In calculating this accrual, the Company made estimates, based on
market information, including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities. The Company periodically re-evaluates its estimates and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated, the total
charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher.

11.
INCOME TAXES

The United States and foreign components of
income before income taxes are as follows:

The components of the
provision for income taxes are as follows:

The significant
components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2004, the Company
has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $1.3 million relating to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carryovers.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company recognized tax benefits related to the exercise of employee stock options in the
amount of $20.9 million, $10.3 million, and $25.7 million, respectively. These

F-25


CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital. At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $35.0 million of additional U.S. net operating loss
carryforwards resulting from stock options, a substantial portion of which begins to expire in 2020. The Company will record the benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards generated from the exercise of employee stock options in the period that
the net operating loss carryforwards are utilized.

At December
31, 2004, the Company had $70.3 million of remaining net operating loss carryforwards from acquisitions. The utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards are limited in any one year pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and begin to
expire in 2020.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had research
and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $10.8 million that expire beginning in 2008. The Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.6 million at December 31, 2004 that expire beginning in 2009.

Additionally, the Company had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $2.1 million at December 31, 2004 that have no expiration date.

A reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rate to the statutory federal rate is as follows:

The Company’s tax
provision is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate
tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and the associated realizability of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company establishes reserves when it becomes probable that a tax
return position may be challenged and that the Company may not succeed in completely defending that challenge. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the settlement of a tax audit. The Company’s
annual tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserves reflect the
probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Resolution of the tax contingencies would be recognized as an increase or decrease to the Company’s tax rate in the period of resolution.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (“the AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a
deduction for 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. The Company has started an evaluation of the effects of the
repatriation provision; however, the Company does not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides guidance concerning the key elements of the provision. The Company expects to complete its
evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the anticipated guidance. Per the provisions of the AJCA, the range of possible amounts that the Company is eligible to
repatriate under this provision is between zero and $500 million. The related potential range of income tax is between zero and $52 million.

Other than considering the one-time repatriation provision within the AJCA, the Company does not expect to remit earnings from its foreign subsidiaries.
Accordingly, since 2000 the Company has not provided for deferred taxes on foreign earnings.

12. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS

The Company operates in a single market consisting of the design, development, marketing, sales and support of access infrastructure software and services for enterprise applications, as well as Web-based desktop
access. The Company’s

revenues are derived from MetaFrame Access Suite sales and related services in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific
regions and from Web-based desktop access services sold by its Citrix Online division. These three geographic regions and the Citrix Online division constitute the Company’s four reportable segments.

The Company does not engage in intercompany revenue transfers between
segments. The Company’s management evaluates performance based primarily on revenues in the geographic locations in which the Company operates and separately evaluates revenues from the Citrix Online division. Segment profit for each segment
includes certain sales, marketing, general and administrative expenses directly attributable to the segment and excludes certain expenses that are managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment profit primarily consist of
research and development costs associated with the MetaFrame Access Suite products, amortization of core and product technology, amortization of other intangible assets, interest, corporate expenses and income taxes, as well as, charges for
in-process research and development. Corporate expenses are comprised primarily of corporate marketing costs, operations and certain general and administrative expenses, which are separately managed. Accounting policies of the segments are the same
as the Company’s consolidated accounting policies.

International revenues (sales outside of the United States) accounted for approximately 53.2%, 54.6% and 53.7% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Net revenues and segment profit for 2004,
2003 and 2002 classified by the Company’s reportable segments, are presented below.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The decrease in
Americas identifiable assets is primarily due to a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments related to the redemption of the Company’s convertible subordinated debentures and to expenditures related to the Net6 and Expertcity
acquisitions.

Export revenue represents shipments of finished
goods and services from the United States to international customers, primarily in Latin America and Canada. Shipments from the United States to international customers for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $32.9 million, $24.3 million and $25.3 million,
respectively.

The Company had net revenue attributed to
individual distributors in excess of 10% of total net sales as follows. There were no individual end-customers that represented greater than 10% of net sales for any of the years presented. The revenue contributed by the distributors below is
primarily recorded in the Americas segment.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $12.6 million and $12.8 million of derivative assets, respectively, and $7.9 million and $9.4 million of
derivative liabilities, respectively, representing the fair values of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments, which are recorded in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The change in derivatives recognized in other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains (losses) that arose from changes in market value of derivatives that were held during the period, and gains (losses) that were
previously unrealized, but have been recognized in current period net income due to termination or maturities of derivative contracts. This reclassification has no effect on total comprehensive income or stockholders’ equity. The following
table presents these components of other comprehensive income, net of tax for the Company’s derivative instruments (in thousands):

The total
cumulative unrealized gain on derivative instruments was $7.0 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Cash Flow Hedges.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had in place foreign currency
forward sale contracts with a notional amount of $39.0 million and $37.2 million, respectively, and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of $165.0 million and $160.9 million, respectively. The fair value of these
contracts at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were assets of $11.5 million and $12.8 million, respectively and liabilities of $3.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively. A substantial portion of the Company’s anticipated overseas expense will be
transacted in local currencies. To protect against fluctuations in operating expenses and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, the Company has established a program that uses forward foreign exchange
forward contracts to reduce its exposure to these potential changes. The terms of these instruments, and the hedged transactions to which they relate, generally do not exceed 12 months. Currencies hedged are Euros, British pounds sterling, Swiss
francs, Australian dollars, and Japanese yen. There was no material ineffectiveness of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts for 2004, 2003 or 2002.

In order to manage its exposure to interest rate risk, in November 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
instrument with a notional amount of $174.6 million that was to expire in March 2004. The swap converted the floating rate return on certain of the Company’s available for sale investment securities to a fixed interest rate. In October 2002,
the Company terminated this interest rate swap instrument. Upon termination, the Company received a cash payment of $9.2 million as settlement under the swap instrument. The swap was previously accounted for as an effective cash flow hedge, and in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, the remaining amount in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $2.4 million was recognized in interest income through the remaining holding period of the underlying investments in
2002.

Fair Value Hedges.

The Company uses interest rate
swap instruments to hedge against the changes in fair value of certain of its available-for-sale securities due to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2004, the instruments have an aggregate notional amount of $182.4 million related to
specific available-for-sale securities and expire on various dates through September 2008. Each of the instruments swap the fixed rate interest on the underlying investments for a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus a specified margin. During 2003, the Company sold $104.0 million of the underlying fixed rate available-for-sale securities and discontinued hedge accounting for the related $104.0 million of the interest rate swaps. Changes
in the fair value of the swap instruments are recorded in earnings along with related designated changes in the value of the underlying investments. The fair value of the instruments at December 31, 2004 were liabilities of approximately $4.4
million and assets of $1.1 million. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the instruments were liabilities of approximately $4.2 million. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. There was no material
ineffectiveness of the Company’s interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Derivatives not Designated as Hedges.

The Company utilizes credit derivatives and other instruments for investment purposes that either do not
qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

and its related interpretations. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these contracts, if any,
are recorded in other income (expense), net. Under the terms of the credit contracts, the Company assumes the default risk, above a certain threshold, of a portfolio of specified referenced issuers in exchange for a fixed yield that is recorded in
interest income. In the event of default by underlying referenced issuers above specified amounts, the Company will pay the counterparty an amount equivalent to its loss, not to exceed the notional value of the contract. The primary risk associated
with these transactions is the default risk of the underlying issuers. The risk levels of these instruments are equivalent to “AAA,” or better single securities. The purpose of the credit default contracts is to provide additional yield on
certain of the Company’s underlying available-for-sale investments.

The Company is a party to three credit default contracts that have an aggregate notional amount of $75.0 million and expire on various dates through March 2008. The Company was also a party to a credit default
contract that has an aggregate notional amount of $195.4 million and expired on March 22, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the Company has restricted approximately $86.3 million of investment securities as collateral for these contracts and interest rate
swaps, which is included in restricted cash equivalents and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company maintains the ability to manage the composition of the restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw
and use excess investment earnings from the restricted collateral for operating purposes. The fixed yield earned on these contracts during 2004 and 2003 is included in interest income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. To date
there have been no credit events for the underlying referenced entities resulting in losses to the Company. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these contracts was not material.

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

The above antidilutive
weighted average shares to purchase shares of common stock includes certain shares under the Company’s stock option programs, certain put warrants under the Company’s stock repurchase program and common stock potentially issuable on the
conversion of the Debentures and were not included in computing diluted earnings per share because their effects were antidilutive for the respective periods that they were outstanding. The decrease in anti-dilutive weighted shares for 2004 compared
to 2003 is due to the redemption of the Company’s convertible subordinated debentures during March 2004.

15. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment.

SFAS No. 123R requires companies to expense the value of employee stock option and similar awards. SFAS No.
123R is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. As of the effective date, the Company will be required to expense all awards granted, modified, cancelled or repurchased as well
as the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No.123. SFAS No.123R permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods: A “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after the
effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. A “prospective” method which includes the
requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123R for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b)
prior interim periods of the year of adoption. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under
current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R’s fair value method will have an impact on the Company’s results of
operations. Currently, the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on the Company’s results of operations cannot be estimated because among other things it will depend on the levels of share-based payments granted in the future. The
Company is currently in the process of determining the effects on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows that will result from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

16. LEGAL MATTERS

The Company is a defendant in various litigation matters generally arising out of the normal course of business. Although it is difficult to predict the
ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, based on discussions with counsel, that the ultimate outcome will not materially affect the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
