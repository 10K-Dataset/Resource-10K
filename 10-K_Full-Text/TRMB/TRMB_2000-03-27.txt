Item 1.           Business

General

     Trimble  Navigation  Limited,  a California  corporation  ("Trimble" or the
"Company"),  develops,  markets, and distributes innovative products and systems
enabled by Global Positioning System ("GPS") technology. We provide end-user and
original  equipment   manufacturer  (OEM)  solutions  for  diverse  applications
including Architecture/Engineering/Construction,  Asset Management and Tracking,
Agriculture,  and  GPS  Component  Technologies.  Trimble  designs  and  markets
electronic  products that determine precise geographic  location.  Our principal
products,  which  utilize  proprietary  software and  firmware,  are  integrated
systems  for  collecting,  analyzing  and  displaying  position  data  in  forms
optimized for specific end-user applications.

Background

     Precise determination of locations both on and above the earth's surface is
a fundamental  requirement in many applications.  For example,  position data is
used for navigation on land, sea and air, and to conduct  surveys and draw maps.
Previous  technologies have limited users to simultaneous  determination of only
two  dimensions--latitude  and  longitude--while   altitude  and  time  required
separate  measurements with different  equipment.  GPS technology provides users
with all of these measurements, using a single instrument. GPS is a system of 27
orbiting Navstar satellites  established and funded by the U.S.  Government.  On
April 27, 1995,  GPS was  declared by the U.S.  Air Force Space  Command to have
achieved Full Operational  Capability.  GPS can complement or replace many other
forms of  electronic  navigation  and position  data  systems.  GPS offers major
advantages  over  prior  technologies  in terms of ease of use,  precision,  and
accuracy,  with worldwide coverage in three dimensions,  and does so in addition
to providing time and velocity measurement capabilities.

     GPS  positioning  is  based on a  triangulation  technique  that  precisely
measures  distances  from  three  or more  Navstar  satellites.  The  satellites
continuously  transmit  precisely timed radio signals using  extremely  accurate
atomic clocks. A GPS receiver  calculates  distances from the satellites in view
by  determining  the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver.
The receiver  then  triangulates  its  position  using its known  distance  from
various  satellites,  and  calculates  latitude,  longitude and altitude.  Under
normal  circumstances,  a current  stand-alone GPS receiver is able to calculate
its position at any point on earth, in the earth's atmosphere, or in lower earth
orbit, to within 100 meters, 24 hours a day. When a GPS receiver is coupled with
a reference  receiver with known precise  position,  accuracies of less than ten
centimeters  are  possible.  In addition,  GPS  provides  highly  accurate  time
measurement.

     * The usefulness of GPS is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and
the GPS  satellites  that are above the horizon at any given  time.  The current
deployment  of 27 satellites  permits  three-dimensional  worldwide  coverage 24
hours a day. However, reception of GPS signals requires line-of-sight visibility
between  the  Navstar  satellites  and the  receiver,  which can be  blocked  by
buildings,  hills and dense  foliage.  For the  receiver to collect a sufficient
signal,  each satellite must be above the horizon,  and the receiver must have a
line of sight to at least three satellites in order to determine its location in
two   dimensions--latitude  and  longitude--and  at  least  four  satellites  to
determine its location in three  dimensions-latitude,  longitude,  and altitude.
The  accuracy  of GPS may also be  limited by  distortion  of GPS  signals  from
ionospheric  and other  atmospheric  conditions,  and intentional or inadvertent
signal  interference or Selective  Availability  (SA).  Selective  Availability,
which is the largest  component of GPS  distortion,  is  controlled  by the U.S.
Department  of Defense and is a  currently  activated,  intentional  system-wide
degradation of stand-alone  GPS accuracy from  approximately  twenty-five to one
hundred meters. Selective Availability may be implemented by the U.S. Department
of Defense in order to deny hostile forces the highly  accurate  position,  time
and  velocity  information  supplied by GPS. In certain  military  applications,
classified  devices  are  utilized  to  decode  the SA  degradation  and  return
accuracies to their original levels.





     By using a technique  called  "differential  GPS" involving two or more GPS
receivers,  accuracies can currently be improved to  approximately  one to three
meters for navigation,  sub-meter for precision  positioning,  and less than ten
centimeters  for  survey  and  machine  guidance  applications,   even  with  SA
activated.  This  technique  compensates  for a number of potential  measurement
distortions,  including  distortions caused by ionospheric and other atmospheric
conditions,  as well as distortions  intentionally introduced into the satellite
data itself,  such as SA.  Differential  GPS involves  placing one receiver at a
known location and continuously comparing its calculated location with its known
location to measure  distortions  in the signal  transmission  and errors in the
satellite  data. At any one time,  such  distortions  and errors are  reasonably
constant  over large  areas,  so that one or more remote GPS  receivers  can use
these  measurements  to correct  their own  position  calculations.  Measurement
corrections can be transmitted either in-real time over a suitable communication
link such as radio or telephone,  or integrated later with accumulated  data, as
is frequently the practice in survey applications.

     Each of  Trimble's  GPS  products  is based  on  proprietary  GPS  receiver
technology.  Trimble's GPS  receivers are capable of tracking all  satellites in
view and automatically selecting the optimum combination of satellites necessary
to provide the most accurate set of measurements  possible.  Communications  and
computational modules, such as databases, database management systems, radio and
other communication equipment,  and various user interfaces,  are added to these
receivers to create fully integrated application-specific solutions.

     Navstar  satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic
systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The
satellites were  originally  designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject
to damage by the hostile space  environment in which they operate.  However,  of
the current  deployment  of 27  satellites  in place,  some have already been in
place for 11 years and have an  average  age of 6 years.  To repair  damaged  or
malfunctioning   satellites  is  currently  not  economically   feasible.  If  a
significant  number of satellites  were to become  inoperable,  there could be a
substantial  delay before they are replaced with new satellites.  A reduction in
the number of operating  satellites  would impair the current utility of the GPS
system  and the  growth of  current  and  additional  market  opportunities.  In
addition,  there  can be no  assurance  that the  U.S.  government  will  remain
committed to the operation and maintenance of GPS satellites over a long period,
or that the policies of the U.S.  Government  for the use of GPS without  charge
will remain unchanged. However, a 1996 Presidential Decision Directive marks the
first time in the  evolution  of GPS that  access for  civilian  use has a solid
foundation in law. Because of  ever-increasing  commercial  applications of GPS,
other U.S.  Government agencies may become involved in the administration or the
regulation of the use of GPS signals.  Any of the foregoing factors could affect
the willingness of buyers of the Company's  products to select GPS-based systems
instead of products  based on competing  technologies.  Any resulting  change in
market demand for GPS products could have a material adverse effect on Trimble's
financial results. In 1995, certain European government  organizations expressed
concern  regarding  the  susceptibility  of  GPS  equipment  to  intentional  or
inadvertent  signal  interference.  Such concern  could  translate  into reduced
demand for GPS products in certain geographic regions in the future.

Business Strategy

     Trimble sees GPS as an  information  utility.  In order to exploit the wide
range  of  applications  made  possible  by  this  information  utility,  we are
implementing the following strategies:

     * Targeted Markets.  Trimble targets a number of specific markets, based on
end-user   applications.    The   markets   that   we   currently   target   are
Architecture/Engineering/Construction,    Asset    Management    and   Tracking,
Agriculture   and  GPS   Component   Technology.   We  believe  that  by  adding
application-specific  features and  functionality  to our core GPS technology we
can deliver  value-added  products  and  enhance  productivity  in our  targeted
markets. In the Architecture/Engineering/Construction market, Trimble focuses on
the centimeter positioning, data collection management,  wireless communication,
and machine  guidance and control.  In the Asset  Management and Tracking market
Trimble focuses on asset tracking, fleet management,  intelligent transportation
systems,  and public safety through integration of GPS,  information  technology
and  wireless  communication.  In the  Agriculture  market  we focus on  precise
machine guidance, yield monitoring,  and variable rate application of fertilizer
and  chemicals.  We intend to continue to leverage our GPS component  technology
directly to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for integration into various
applications.

     Differentiated  Product  Solutions.  Trimble seeks to establish and sustain
leadership in its targeted markets by offering products that are  differentiated
through software, firmware,  customized user interfaces, and quality service and
support.  Where feasible, we emphasize  application-specific  systems that solve
end-user problems in our targeted markets. We believe that a substantial portion
of the value of our products is derived  from the  firmware  that is embedded in
the product or software  provided to enable superior  performance.  In addition,
Trimble  incorporates




other   technologies   into  many  of  its   products,   such  as  wireless
communications, information technologies and non-GPS positioning technologies in
order to optimize product features for our end-users.

     Multichannel  Distribution  and Strategic  Alliances.  Trimble seeks direct
communication  with its  customers  in order to develop  and modify its  product
designs as necessary to maximize  utility and payback to the user. We have built
a  worldwide  sales  and  service  organization  made up of  Company  employees,
distributors  and  dealers.  In  addition,  we intend to continue to develop new
alliances and to strengthen existing alliances and OEM relationships to increase
our leverage of GPS component  technologies.  Trimble has pursued such alliances
with  several  companies,  including  VDO Car  Communication  (a division of the
Mannesmann Group),  Pioneer Electronics  Corporation,  Seiko Epson, Blaupunkt (a
wholly owned subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH), NortelNetworks,  British Telecom,
E-systems, Honeywell, and Intel in the Mobile and Timing Technology segment; and
Caterpillar,  Inc.,  Topcon,  and CNH Global (formerly Case  Corporation) in the
Precision Positioning segment.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

     Trimble  operates in a single industry segment as a leader in designing and
developing  innovative  products enabled by GPS technology.  We provide end-user
and Original  Equipment  Manufacture  solutions for diverse  applications in our
target markets. These applications include:

     o Architecture/Engineering/Construction  --  surveying,  mapping,  machine
       guidance/control;
     o Asset Management and Tracking -- fixed asset mapping and fleet management
       using mobile positioning;
     o Agriculture -- mapping, yield monitoring,  variable rate applications and
       machine guidance/control; and
     o GPS Component  Technologies  -- automotive  navigation,  timing  systems,
       commercial avionics, and military systems.

     We design,  market,  and  distribute  electronic  products  that  determine
precise geographic  location combined with data  communications and applications
software.  We sell our products through a direct-sales  force located in fifteen
countries,  as well as through a worldwide network of dealers,  distributors and
authorized representatives.

     Research and development  activities are conducted at Trimble's  facilities
in Sunnyvale,  California,  and Christchurch,  New Zealand.  Solectron currently
manufactures most of Trimble's  products.  In addition,  we have a manufacturing
facility in Austin,  Texas,  focused  primarily  on  FAA-certified  products for
commercial aviation and military systems.

     To achieve distribution,  marketing,  production, and technology advantages
for our targeted  markets,  we manage our industry  segment  within two Business
Units:  the  Precision  Positioning  Group  (PPG)  and  the  Mobile  and  Timing
Technologies  Group  (MTT).  Each  Business  Unit is  managed  by a senior  vice
president who is responsible for strategy,  marketing,  product  development and
financial performance.

     The  Precision   Positioning  Group  derives  its  revenue  from  precision
positioning  solutions for the architecture,  engineering,  construction,  asset
management,  and agriculture  markets.  These markets require  sub-centimeter to
meter  3D   positioning   accuracy   for   surveying,   mapping,   and   machine
guidance/control  applications. The Mobile and Timing Technologies Group derives
its revenues from automotive, timing, fleet management, commercial aviation, and
military  systems,  as well as from  development of software  licenses and other
rights for the use of our GPS technology to third parties.

     Although we believe that these  Business  Units have growth  potential  for
sales of GPS products,  there can be no assurance  that such Business Units will
continue to develop,  particularly  given that GPS-based systems are still in an
early stage of adoption in some of these markets.  Our future growth will depend
on the timely  development  of the industry  markets in which Trimble  currently
competes, and on our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for
our products.

Precision Positioning Group

     The  Precision  Positioning  Group focuses its efforts in markets where the
distribution chain uses independent distributors or a direct sales force to sell
directly to the  end-users.  The  products  are  typically  system  solutions in
high-end, value-added markets.





     A key  business  strategy of PPG is  interoperability,  which  involves the
focus on, and  development  of systems that integrate  sensors  utilizing a wide
variety  of  technologies   and   communications   with  GPS.  We  believe  this
interoperability  developed by Trimble is an extremely  important advantage over
any of the competition. The emphasis is on providing solutions for applications,
which combine GPS and other technologies,  and results in a higher real value to
the  customer.  The  concept  of  interoperability  applies  to  electronic  and
mechanical  accommodations of other technologies,  together with GPS, to solve a
problem.  Probably the most  important area of  interoperability,  and often the
least recognizable until the integrated solution is put into use, is in the area
of data interchange.

Mobile and Timing Technologies

     The Mobile and Timing  Technologies  Group  focuses  its efforts in markets
where  the  majority  of its  products  are  sold  directly  to OEMs  or  system
integrators.   The  products  are  designed  to  support  system   solutions  in
high-volume applications.  In some instances the Business Unit's products are in
the form of software  and chipset  licenses  and other rights for the use of our
GPS technology by third parties.

     This  Business  Unit  focuses  on  product  lines  that  address  the fleet
management market, and leverage GPS component technologies for use in automotive
navigation,  timing for  telecommunications,  commercial  aviation  and military
systems.   The   product   lines  in  these   markets   involve   full-function,
high-performance  embedded  GPS  engines  that are  frequently  utilized in some
markets with integrated  communication systems such as cellular,  satellite, and
special  mobile radio systems.  The GPS equipment  provides  accurate  position,
velocity,  and timing  information  for use in such diverse  applications as car
navigation,  airborne  navigation,  munitions  guidance,  vehicle and high-value
cargo tracking.

     Trimble supplies GPS boards and chipsets,  and licenses  technology to some
of the leading automotive electronics suppliers,  including Pioneer Electronics,
Magneti Marelli, VDO Car Communication (a division of the Mannesmann Group), and
Blaupunkt (a wholly owned subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH). Trimble is also part

Sales and Marketing

     Trimble  currently has nine regional sales offices in the United States and
six in Europe, as well as offices in Australia,  Canada,  China, Japan,  Mexico,
New Zealand,  Russia, and Singapore.  We have substantial variation in the needs
of our sales and distribution channels, which are rapidly changing.

     Domestic. Trimble sells its products in the United States primarily through
dealers,   distributors,   and  authorized  representatives,   supplemented  and
supported  by our direct  salesforce.  We have also  pursued  alliances  and OEM
relationships  with established  foreign and domestic  companies to assist us in
penetrating certain markets.

     International.  Trimble markets to end-users through a network of more than
100 dealers and distributors in more than 85 countries.  Distributors  carry one
or more product lines and are generally limited to selling either in one country
or in a portion of a country.  Trimble  occasionally  grants exclusive rights to
market certain products within specified countries.

     Sales  to   unaffiliated   customers  in  foreign   locations   represented
approximately 52%, 46%, and 46% of Trimble's total revenue in fiscal years 1999,
1998  and  1997,  respectively.   Sales  to  unaffiliated  customers  in  Europe
represented  25%,  25%,  and 22% of net  revenue in such  periods,  and sales to
unaffiliated  customers in the Far East  represented  14%, 13%, and 15% of total
revenue in such periods, respectively.




     Support.  Trimble's  general terms and conditions for sales of its products
include  a  one-year  warranty.   Commercial  Aviation  products,  however,  are
generally  sold  with a basic  three-year  warranty  period  with an  additional
two-year  warranty sold with some units;  select  military  programs may require
extended warranty periods.  We support our products on a board replacement level
from locations in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan, and New Zealand, as well
as  Sunnyvale,  California.  Trimble's  dealers and  distributors  also  provide
factory-trained  third-party  maintenance,  including  warranty and non warranty
repairs.  We reimburse  dealers and  distributors  for all  authorized  warranty
repairs  they  perform.  Trimble  does not derive a  significant  portion of its
revenues from support activities.

Competition

     * In the segments  currently  being  addressed by Trimble,  competition  is
intense. Within each of its segments, Trimble has encountered direct competition
from both foreign and domestic  suppliers,  and expects  that  competition  will
continue  to  intensify.  Indirect  competition  is also  beginning  to  emerge,
particularly from semiconductor and consumer  electronic  manufacturers that are
anticipating the emergence of high-volume, customer-oriented GPS applications.

     The PPG segment faces  competition from Leica AG, Spectra Precision (Thermo
Electron),  Topcon,  Sokkia,  Ashtech Precision Products (part of Magellan Corp.
via Orbital Sciences Corp.),  Novatel (Canadian Marconi),  Allen Osborne,  Javad
Positioning   Systems,    Communications   Systems   International,    Corvallis
Microtechnology, Inc., and Tripod Data Systems.

     The MTT segment faces ongoing competition from Motorola,  Inc.; Japan Radio
Corporation,  Rockwell International Corporation,  Symmetricom,  Datum, Odetics,
Rockwell Collins, Universal Navigation Corporation,  Canadian Marconi Company (a
subsidiary  of  the  General  Electric  Company  plc),   Northstar  Avionics  (a
subsidiary of Canadian  Marconi),  and UPS Aviation  Technologies (a division of
United Parcel Service of America,  Inc.), The New Honeywell Incorporated (Merged
Allied Signal and Honeywell),  Smiths Industries,  ARNAV, Interstate Electronics
(subsidiary of Figgie International),  Raytheon, and Litton Industries,  Orbital
Sciences Corp., and Wireless Link.

     A  number  of  Trimble's  markets  are also  served  primarily  by  non-GPS
technologies,  many of which are currently more accepted and less expensive than
GPS-based  systems.  The success of GPS-based  systems  against these  competing
technologies  depends  in part on  whether  GPS  systems  can offer  significant
improvements in  productivity,  accuracy,  and  reliability in a  cost-effective
manner, as well as continued market education about such products.

     The  principal  competitive  factors in the markets that Trimble  addresses
include ease of use, physical characteristics (including size, weight, and power
consumption),   product   features   (including   differential   GPS),   product
performance,   product  reliability,  price,  size  of  installed  base,  vendor
reputation,  and  financial  resources.  We believe that our products  currently
compete favorably with other products on most of the foregoing  factors,  though
we may be at a competitive  disadvantage  against other companies having greater
financial, marketing, and service and support resources.

     * Trimble  believes that its ability to compete  successfully in the future
against  existing and additional  competitors will depend largely on its ability
to provide systems products and services that have significantly  differentiated
features with improved  cost/benefit  ratios to our  end-users.  There can be no
assurances that we will be able to implement this strategy successfully, or that
our competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than Trimble,
will not apply those resources to compete  successfully  against us on the basis
of system features and end-user cost/benefit ratios.

Research and Development

     Trimble's  leadership  position in its targeted  markets is the result,  in
large part,  of its strong  commitment  to  research  and  development.  Trimble
invests  heavily in developing  positioning  and  information  technologies  and
wireless  communications,  including  the  design of  proprietary  software  and
integrated circuits for GPS receivers.  Moreover,  Trimble develops  substantial
systems expertise and user interfaces for a variety of applications.  Below is a
table of Trimble's  expenditures on research and development over the last three
fiscal years.

     Often a new product is developed  initially for an individual  customer who
is willing to purchase  development-stage  products.  We have used feedback from
such  initial  customers as a primary  source of  information  in designing  and
refining our products and in defining, with greater precision, customer needs in
emerging market areas.  During 1996, Trimble  established an advanced technology
laboratory  where we devote a portion of our corporate  research and development
expenditures to advance core GPS technology and its integration into synergistic
technologies  such as  communications,  sensors,  and information  technologies.
These  technological   advances  are  sometimes  supported  financially  through
strategic alliances and partnerships.

     * Trimble  expects that a  significant  portion of future  revenues will be
derived  from  sales of newly  introduced  products.  Consequently,  our  future
success  depends in part on our ability to  continue to develop new  competitive
products with timely market  introduction.  Advances in product  technology will
require continued substantial investment in research and development in order to
maintain  and  enhance  our  market  position.   Development  and  manufacturing
schedules for technology products are difficult to predict,  and there can be no
assurance that we will achieve  timely  initial  customer sales of new products.
The timely  availability  of these products in volume,  and their  acceptance by
customers,  are important to Trimble's future success. In addition,  some of our
products are subject to governmental and similar  certifications before they can
be sold. For example,  CE certification  for radiated  emissions is required for
most GPS receiver  products sold in the European  Union.  An inability to obtain
such  certifications  in a timely  manner  could have an  adverse  effect on our
operating results.

Manufacturing

     Trimble  seeks to be a low-cost  provider and to serve the growth in demand
for GPS-based products and systems through the outsourcing of manufacturing, and
the design of products around a common core of receivers.

     On August  10,  1999,  Trimble  signed  an Asset  Purchase  Agreement  with
Solectron  Corporation  and  Solectron  Federal  Systems,  Inc.   (collectively,
"Solectron"). The closing of the transaction occurred on August 13, 1999. At the
closing  of the Asset  Purchase  Agreement,  Trimble  transferred  to  Solectron
substantially all of our tangible  manufacturing assets located at the Company's
Sunnyvale,  California,  campus.  These  assets  include  but are not limited to
equipment,  fixtures and work in progress, as well as certain contract and other
intangible  assets  and  rights,  together  with  certain  related  obligations,
including  but  not  limited  to  real  property  subleases  covering  Trimble's
manufacturing floor space, and outstanding purchase order commitments. The Asset
Purchase Agreement also provided for Solectron's  subsequent purchase, on August
30, 1999, of Trimble's entire component inventory on hand as of August 13, 1999.

     Concurrent  with the closing of the Asset Purchase  Agreement,  Trimble and
Solectron also entered into a Supply  Agreement.  The Supply Agreement  provides
for the exclusive  manufacture by Solectron of almost all Trimble products for a
period of three years. In addition,  Trimble maintains a manufacturing  facility
in Austin,  Texas,  primarily  focused on FAA certified  products for commercial
aviation and military systems.

     Solectron offered  employment to approximately  230 Trimble  manufacturing,
engineering  and  related  support  personnel,   and  Trimble  understands  that
substantially  all  such  employees  initially  accepted  such  employment  with
Solectron.

     * The  utilization of Electronic  Manufacturing  Services (EMS) provided by
Solectron  will  enable  the  management  of  Trimble  to focus on the true core
competencies  of Trimble's  business,  while still  deriving the benefits from a
world-class manufacturing organization.  Benefits which Trimble hopes to receive
from this outsourcing of manufacturing include:

     o The purchasing power of a company with a multibillion-dollar  procurement
       budget.
     o Supply chain management and order fulfillment models developed to support
       the stringent demands of current customers.




     o Flexibility and ability to respond to upside/market  opportunities due to
       the large scale of Solectron's manufacturing capacity.
     o Manufacturing,  service  and  distribution  capabilities  on a worldwide
       scale, enabling Trimble to provide more cost-effective supply solutions,
       closer to its customers.
     o Manufacturing  practices  yielding stable  processes and providing better
       quality output.
     o Availability  of the latest  and most  cost-effective  product  assembly
       technologies.
     o Provision  of latest  design  services  to  participate  in the  product
       development   cycle   with  a  fresh   and   unbiased   focus  on  design
       for manufacturability, lower cost, higher quality and higher reliability.

     Trimble will continue to provide state-of-the art Computer Aided Design and
Computer  Integrated  Manufacturing  service  capabilities  to  the  development
community relating to PCB layout, assembly drawing and schematic development. We
intend to remain  self-sufficient  in this field to ensure that the  development
entities  can have the  maximum  benefit  from the  utilization  of their  time,
contributing to faster and more effective product release cycles.

     Trimble  maintains quality control  procedures for its products,  including
testing during design, prototype, and pilot stages of production, and inspection
and testing of finished products using automated test equipment.

     Trimble takes a modular and upgradable  approach to its products,  building
around a common core of GPS  receivers  with  customized  software  and hardware
systems to analyze and present  position data. Our core receiver  technology has
evolved since the  development of our first GPS receiver  product in 1984, as we
have worked to reduce the size, weight,  power consumption and cost of the basic
GPS receiver. In this process, we have designed our own semi-custom, single-chip
GPS processor.

Backlog

     Trimble  believes that due to the volume of products  delivered  from shelf
inventories and the shortening of product delivery  schedules,  backlog is not a
meaningful  indicator of future business prospects.  Therefore,  we believe that
backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses

     Trimble currently holds approximately 280 U.S. patents and 18 related
foreign  patents that expire at various  dates no earlier than 2005. It also has
more than 180 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. We currently license
certain  peripheral   aspects  of  our  technology  from  Spectrum   Information
Technologies and GeoResearch.

     Although we believe that our patents and trademarks  have value,  there can
be no assurance that those patents and trademarks, or any additional patents and
trademarks  that  may  be  obtained  in  the  future,  will  provide  meaningful
protection from  competition.  We actively  develop and protect our intellectual
property through a program of patenting, enforcement, and licensing.

     We do not  believe  that  any of our  products  infringe  patent  or  other
proprietary  rights of third parties,  but we cannot be certain that they do not
do so. (See Note 17 to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.) If infringement is
alleged,  legal defense  costs could be material,  and there can be no assurance
that the necessary  licenses could be obtained on terms or conditions that would
not have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

     In the second quarter of 1997,  Trimble expanded a prior license  agreement
with Pioneer Electronic  Corporation for certain of the technology  contained in
our TANS product for inclusion in in-vehicle  navigation products sold in Japan.
We received a one-time  $2.2  million  licensing  fee in  consideration  for the
expansion of this license.

     * Trimble  expects  that we will enter into  other  licensing  arrangements
relating to its technologies.

Employees

     As of December 31, 1999, Trimble employed 978 persons:  317 in research and
product development,  400 in sales and marketing, 118 in manufacturing,  and 143
in administration  and finance.  Of these, 75 were located in Europe, 175 in New
Zealand,  16 in Japan,  6 in Singapore,  5 in  Australia,  and 701 in the United
States. We also employ temporary and contract  personnel.  Use of such personnel
has  decreased  over the last year and is not  included  in the above  headcount
numbers.  Competition  in recruiting  personnel is intense.  We believe that our
continued  ability to attract and retain highly skilled  management,  marketing,
and  technical  personnel  is essential  to our future  growth and success.  Our
employees are not represented by a labor union, and we have not experienced work
stoppages.

     Trimble's  success  depends  in  part  on the  continued  contribution  and
long-term  effectiveness  of our executive  officers and key  technical,  sales,
marketing, support, research and development,  manufacturing, and administrative
personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace.

     Trimble had 1,357 registered shareholders of record as of March 13, 2000.

     Trimble's stock price is subject to significant volatility.  If revenues or
earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community,  there could
be an immediate  and  significant  impact on the trading price for the Company's
stock.  Due to stock market forces that are beyond our control,  and due also to
the nature of our business, such short falls can be sudden.

     Trimble  has  never  paid  cash  dividends  on its  Common  Stock.  Trimble
presently  intends to retain its  earnings  to finance  the  development  of its
business,  and does not  presently  intend to declare any cash  dividends in the
foreseeable  future.  Under our  current  $50,000,000  revolving  line of credit
agreement,  Trimble is  restricted  from paying  dividends  without the lender's
consent. Under Trimble's Note Purchase Agreement,  pursuant to which the Company
issued $30,000,000 of its subordinated promissory notes in June 1994, Trimble is
also restricted  from paying  dividends.  See Notes 7 and 9 to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in Item 8.

Item 7.           Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
                  and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS

     In fiscal  1999,  Trimble's  annual  revenues  from  continuing  operations
increased to $271.4  million from $268.3 million in fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1999,
Trimble had net income from continuing operations of $18.7 million, or $0.82 per
share,  diluted,  compared  to a net loss from  continuing  operations  of $27.4
million, or ($1.22) per share, diluted, in fiscal 1998. The total net income for
fiscal 1999, including discontinued operations,  was $21.6 million, or $0.95 per
share,  diluted,  compared  to a total  net  loss  for  fiscal  1998,  including
discontinued operations, of $53.4 million, or ($2.38) per share, diluted.

The following table sets forth,  for the periods  indicated,  certain  financial
data as a percentage of total revenue:


     Revenue.  In fiscal 1999,  total revenue  increased to $271.4  million from
$268.3  million in fiscal 1998,  which  represents a percentage  increase of 1%.
Total revenue  increased in fiscal 1998 to $268.3 million from $266.4 million in
fiscal  1997,  which  represents  a  percentage  increase  of less than 1%.  The
following table breaks out Trimble's revenues by industry segment:



Precision Positioning Group

     The Precision  Positioning  Group  revenues  decreased by 3% in fiscal 1999
over  fiscal  1998.  The 1999  revenue  decrease  compared to 1998 is due to the
following:

     o Sales were impacted  from the change in commission  structure for some of
       our products from commission dealers to buy/sell  dealers in fiscal 1999.
       Under the buy/sell arrangement, the product is discounted to the dealer,
       as opposed to end-user pricing with commissions recorded under sales and
       marketing expense.
     o Sales  to  Original  Equipment  Manufacturers  such  as CNH  Global  and
       Caterpillar  decreased as compared to 1998 sales due to an economic
       slowdown in the United States for mining and agriculture related
       products.




     o In the fourth  quarter of 1999,  delivery  problems due to critical  part
       shortages in our supply chain,  and transitional  issues with outsourcing
       our manufacturing, had a negative impact on revenue for the fiscal year
       ended 1999.

     Precision  Positioning  Group  revenues  had a growth rate of 16% in fiscal
1998 over fiscal 1997.  The 1998 increase  compared to 1997 was primarily due to
increases in revenues in the land surveying, marine surveying,  mapping, and GIS
systems, and mining, construction, and agriculture markets. The increase in land
surveying was due to the continued  strong customer  acceptance of Trimble's GPS
Total  Station 4800 and 4700  products.  Also,  the  increase in marine  survey,
mapping,  and GIS,  as well as mining,  construction  and  agriculture  reflects
increased demand for these products.

Mobile and Timing Technologies

     Mobile and Timing  Technologies  revenues  increased 8% in fiscal 1999 over
fiscal 1998. The increase is attributable to strong growth in our automotive and
timing  markets  which was partially  offset by decreases in commercial  marine,
commercial air transport, and military systems, due to the following:

     o Trimble  decided to exit the  commercial  marine  business  in the fourth
       quarter  of 1998 and sold the last of such  products  in the  second
       quarter of 1999.
     o Commercial  air transport was down, due to decreases in market demand and
       the successful  conclusion of shipments in fiscal 1998 to American
       Airlines and Continental Airlines through our Honeywell alliance,  which
       were not repeated in fiscal 1999.
     o Military  systems  declined due to the completion of our CUGR contract in
       the first quarter of 1998 which sales were not repeated in 1999.

     The Mobile and Timing  Technologies  revenues  decreased 17% in fiscal 1998
from fiscal 1997. The 1998 decrease was primarily in automotive,  commercial air
transport and military aerospace systems.  The softness in the automotive market
was due to the financial difficulties of a major customer and a delay in our new
product  introductions.  The  commercial  air  transport  decrease  was  due  to
less-than-anticipated  demand from Honeywell,  and the military aerospace system
decrease was due to the large dollar shipment on the CUGR contract in the fourth
quarter of 1997, which was not repeated in 1998. In addition,  Mobile and Timing
Technologies  revenues  in  1997,  included  $1.8  million  in  revenues  from a
development   agreement  in  connection   with  an  irrevocable   nonrefundable,
nonrecurring engineering fee and a nonrecurring one-time $2.2 million technology
license from Pioneer Electronic  Corporation in connection with expansion of its
prior license for in-car navigation.

     * Military  sales are highly  dependent  on  contracts  that are subject to
government approval and are,  therefore,  expected to continue to fluctuate from
period to period.  Trimble believes that  opportunities in this market have been
substantially reduced by cutbacks in U.S. and foreign military spending.

Export Sales

     * Export sales from domestic operations,  as a percentage of total revenue,
were 38% in 1999, 34% in 1998, and 28% in 1997. Sales to unaffiliated  customers
in foreign  locations,  as a percentage of total revenue,  were 52% in 1999, and
46% in both 1998 and 1997.  Trimble  anticipates  that export  revenue and sales
made by its subsidiaries in locations  outside the U.S. will continue to account
for a significant portion of its revenue. For this reason, Trimble is subject to
the risks inherent in these sales,  including  unexpected  changes in regulatory
requirements,  exchange  rates,  governmental  approval,  and  tariffs  or other
barriers.  Even though the U.S. Government  announced on March 29, 1996, that it
would  support and  maintain  the GPS system,  as well as  eliminate  the use of
Selective  Availability  (SA) -- a method of degrading GPS accuracy -- there may
be a reluctance in certain  foreign  markets to purchase  products  based on GPS
technology,  given the control of GPS by the U.S. Government.  Trimble's results
of  operations  could be  adversely  affected  if we were  unable to continue to
generate significant sales in locations outside the U.S.

     No  single  customer,  including  the  U.S.  Government  and its  agencies,
accounted for 10% or more of Trimble's  total  revenues in fiscal 1999,  1998 or
1997. It is possible; however, that in future periods the failure of one or more
large  customers to purchase  products in quantities  anticipated by the Company
may adversely affect the results of operations.

     * Gross Margin.  Gross margin varies due to a number of factors,  including
product mix, domestic versus international sales,  customer type, the effects of
production volumes and fixed  manufacturing costs on unit product




costs,  and new product  start-up  costs.  In fiscal 1999, the gross margin
percentage on product sales was 53%,  compared with 47% in 1998 and 53% in 1997.
The   increase  in  gross  margin   percentages   primarily   reflect   improved
manufacturing   cost  controls   achieved  through  the   consolidation  of  the
manufacturing  organization,  resulting  in  improved  efficiencies  and reduced
inventory.  In  addition,  gross  margins in the second half of fiscal 1999 were
favorably  impacted by the cost benefits of  outsourcing  our  manufacturing  to
Solectron.  The 1997 margins were enhanced by the positive  impact of nonproduct
revenues of $2.2 million recognized from Pioneer Electronic Corporation and from
a  development  agreement  in  connection  with an  irrevocable,  nonrefundable,
nonrecurring engineering fee of $1.8 million; however, there can be no assurance
that similar items will recur in the future. In addition, because of product mix
changes within and among the industry markets,  market pressures on unit selling
prices,  fluctuations in unit manufacturing  costs, and other factors,  positive
future gross margins cannot be assured.

     * Trimble  expects that in the future a higher  percentage  of its business
will be conducted  through  alliances  with strategic  partners.  As a result of
volume  pricing and the  assumption of certain  operating  costs by the partner,
margins  on this  business  are  likely  to be  lower  than  sales  directly  to
end-users.

     Operating  Expenses.  The following table shows operating  expenses for the
periods  indicated.  It  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  narrative
descriptions of those operating expenses below:


                                               Fiscal Years Ended

                           ---------------    ---------------     -------------

     Research and Development.  Research and development  spending  decreased in
absolute  dollars during fiscal 1999,  representing  13% of revenues as compared
with 17% in 1998 and 14% in 1997. The lower research and development expenses in
1999 are due primarily to Trimble's  receiving  approximately  $4.2 million more
funds from cost reimbursement  projects in 1999 as compared to 1998. Also, there
were  decreases  in our  expenses  of  approximately  $5.0  million  related  to
electronic parts, depreciation, travel, personnel, and other supplies as part of
the Company's  restructuring  plans which were  implemented  in the last half of
fiscal 1998.

     The  dollar  increase  from  1997  to 1998 is due  primarily  to  Trimble's
receiving approximately$3.5 million fewer funds from cost reimbursement projects
in 1998 as compared with 1997.

     Trimble plans to continue its aggressive development of future products.

     * Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased during fiscal
1999,  representing  20% of  revenues,  as compared  with 23% in 1998 and 22% in
1997. The primary reason for the dollar and percentage decrease in expenses from
1998  to  1999  is  decreases  of  approximately   $7.7  million  in  personnel,
consultants,  travel,  advertising,  trade shows,  expensed demo equipment,  and
other office  supplies as part of the Company's  restructuring  plan,  which was
implemented in the last half of fiscal 1998. In addition, sales commissions were
lower as a percentage of sales,  due to the change in dealer  structure for some
of our product lines from commission dealers to buy/sell.

     The primary reason for the dollar and percentage increases in expenses from
1997 to 1998 was an increase of  approximately  $2.1  million in  personnel  and
related  expenses  that  accompany  an increase in the number of  employees.  In
addition,  Trimble  experienced  increases  in  expenses of  approximately  $1.1
million related to trade shows, advertising, and demo equipment expenses.

     * Trimble's future growth will depend in part on the timely development and
continued  viability  of the markets in which we currently  compete,  and on our
ability to  continue to identify  and exploit new markets for our  products.  In
addition, we have encountered  significant  competition in selected markets, and
we expect  such  competition  to  intensify  as the market for GPS  applications
receives  acceptance.  Several of Trimble's  competitors




are major corporations with substantially greater financial, technical, and
marketing  resources.  Increased  competition may result in reduced market share
and is likely to result in price reductions of GPS-based  products,  which could
adversely affect Trimble's revenues and profitability.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative  expenses increased
in absolute  dollars  during  fiscal  1999,  representing  12% of  revenues,  as
compared  with 12% in 1998 and 10% in  1997.  The  increase  in  fiscal  1999 as
compared to 1998 is due to an increase in the  allowance  for doubtful  accounts
related to  customers  in South  America  for 1999;  and an increase in building
rental costs due to the renewal of many of our building  leases.  This  increase
was  partially  offset  by  space  consolidations  as part of our  restructuring
efforts in the fourth quarter of 1998.

     The  increase  from  1997  to 1998  was due  primarily  to an  increase  of
approximately  $1.7 million in personnel and the related expenses that accompany
an increase in the number of employees and  consultants,  as well as an increase
of  approximately  $1.7  million  in  outside  services  related  to legal  fees
associated with certain litigation matters during 1998.

     Restructuring  Charges.  As noted in Note 8 to the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements   during  the  year  ended  January  1,  1999,   Trimble  recorded  a
restructuring  charge of $10.3 million classified in operating  expenses.  These
charges were a result of Trimble's  reorganization to improve business processes
and   to   decrease   organizational   redundancies,   to   improve   management
accountability and to improve our focus on profitable operations. As a result of
the  reorganization,   Trimble  downsized  its  operations,  including  reducing
headcount  and  facilities   space  usage,   and  canceled  its   enterprisewide
information  system project and certain research and development  projects.  The
impact of these  decisions  was that  significant  amounts of our fixed  assets,
prepaid  expenses,  and  purchased  technology  had been  impaired  and  certain
liabilities  incurred.  Trimble  wrote  down the  related  assets  to their  net
realizable values and made provisions for the estimated liabilities.

     The  elements  of the  charges  incurred  in  fiscal  1998 and the  amounts
remaining  at  December  31,  1999,  on the  balance  sheet are as  follows  (in
thousands):


     The cash expenditures  associated with the remaining obligations will occur
primarily in fiscal 2000.

     Nonoperating  income (expense),  net.Nonoperating  income  (expense),  net,
includes  interest  income and  expense,  as well as gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions.

     Foreign exchange gains were $28,000 in fiscal 1999,  compared with gains of
$234,000 in 1998 and 1997.  Trimble's policy is to hedge its exposure to foreign
currency  transactions  in order to  minimize  the  effect of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates on consolidated results of operations.  Gains and losses
arising  from  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  offset  gains  and  losses
resulting from the underlying hedged transactions.

     Interest  income  increased  in 1999 from 1998 and  decreased  in 1998 from
1997.  The higher  interest  income in 1999 is due  primarily  to the  increased
interest  income received on cash and short-term  investments  because of higher
average balance for fiscal 1999 over fiscal 1998.

     The  decrease  in 1998  from  1997 was  because  of lower  interest  income
received on cash and short-term  investments  due to lower average  balances for
the year, over the prior year.

     Interest  expense  decreased  slightly in 1999 due to lower fees in foreign
locations.  Interest expense includes interest on a $30.0 million note issued in
August  1995,  and fees on unused  lines of  credit.  (See  Notes 7 and 9 to the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for details of long-term  debt and lines of
credit.)

     Income  Tax  Provision.  Trimble's  effective  tax  rates  from  continuing
operations  for  fiscal  years  1999,  1998 and 1997  are  10%,  (6%),  and 12%,
respectively.  The 1999 and 1997  income  tax rates  are less  than the  federal





statutory  rate of 35%, due  primarily to the  realization  of the benefits from
prior net operating losses and previously reserved deferred tax assets. The 1998
income tax rate  differs  from the federal  statutory  rate,  due  primarily  to
foreign taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net operating losses.

     Inflation. The effects of inflation on Trimble's financial results have not
been significant to date.

LITIGATION

     * Trimble is involved in a number of legal  matters as discussed in Note 17
to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  While  Trimble  does not expect to
suffer  significant  adverse  effects  from  these  litigation  matters  or from
unasserted claims, the nature of litigation is unpredictable and there can be no
assurance that it will not do so.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     * At December  31,  1999,  Trimble had cash and cash  equivalents  of $49.3
million and $52.7 million in  short-term  investments.  Trimble's  cash and cash
equivalents and short-term  investments increased from the prior year, due to an
increase  in net income and the  receipt of $26.9  million in cash as part of an
agreement  with  Solectron  for  the  outsourcing  of  Trimble's   manufacturing
operations  located in  Sunnyvale,  California  (See Note 4 to the  consolidated
financial  statements).  Trimble's long-term debt consisted primarily of a $30.0
million  note  obligation  due in 2001.  We had no debt  outstanding  under  our
$50,000,000 unsecured line of credit but had issued certain letters of credit as
of December 31, 1999,  amounting to approximately  $283,000.  Trimble has relied
primarily on cash provided by operating and financing  activities  and net sales
of short-term  investments to fund capital  expenditures,  the repurchase of the
Company's common stock, and other investing activities. Management believes that
its cash, cash equivalents,  and short-term  investment balances,  together with
its existing credit line,  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated  operating
cash needs for at least the next twelve months.

     * In fiscal  1999,  the cash  provided by  operating  activities  was $23.6
million,  as compared  to cash  provided  of $7.0  million in the  corresponding
period in 1998.  Cash  provided by operating  activities  in 1999 arose from the
Company's  net income,  plus  depreciation  and  amortization  and  decreases in
inventories  and offset  partially  by  increases  in  accounts  receivable  and
decreases in accrued  liabilities.  Inventory from  continuing  operations as of
December 31, 1999  decreased  by $20.6  million  from the 1998  year-end  levels
primarily,  due  to  the  transition  of  certain  manufacturing  operations  to
Solectron as well as a focused  effort by Trimble to reduce  inventory by supply
chain synchronization, reducing lead and cycle times, simplifying product lines,
and implementing tighter control over its material forecasting process (See Note
4 to the consolidated  financial  statements.)  Trimble's ability to continue to
generate cash from operations will depend in a large part on revenues,  the rate
of collections  of accounts  receivable,  and the  successful  management of the
Solectron manufacturing relationship.

     Cash provided by sales of common stock in 1999 represents the proceeds from
purchases made by employees pursuant to Trimble's stock option plan and employee
stock  purchase  plan,  and totaled $4.5 million for the year ended December 13,
1999.

     * In August 1997, Trimble entered into a three-year,  $50,000,000 unsecured
revolving credit facility with four banks (the "Credit  Agreement").  The Credit
Agreement  enables  Trimble to borrow up to  $50,000,000,  provided that certain
financial  and other  covenants  are met. As of October 20, 1999,  Trimble,  the
Agent, and the Lenders agreed to change and amend certain covenants for the life
of the loan,  which expires in August of 2000. The $50,000,000  revolving credit
facility was modified to include  Trimble's  prior separate  $5,000,000  line of
credit and to simplify the entire arrangement. The Credit Agreement provides for
payment of a commitment  fee of 0.25% and borrowings to bear interest at 1% over
LIBOR if the total  funded  debt to EBITDA is less than or equal to 1.00  times,
0.3% and borrowings to bear interest at 1.25% over LIBOR if the ratio is greater
than 1.00 times and less than or equal to 2.00 times, or 0.4%, and borrowings to
bear  interest at 1.75% over LIBOR if the ratio is greater  than 2.00 times.  In
addition to  borrowing  at the  specified  LIBOR rate,  Trimble has the right to
borrow with  interest at the higher of (i) one of the bank's  annual  prime rate
and (ii) the  federal  funds rate plus 0.5%.  To date,  Trimble has not made any
borrowings under the $50,000,00  unsecured  revolving  credit facility,  but has
issued  certain  letters  of  credit  as of  December  31,  1999,  amounting  to
approximately $283,000. In addition, Trimble is restricted from paying dividends
under the terms of the Credit Agreement.

     In June 1994, Trimble issued $30.0 million of subordinated promissory notes
bearing  interest at an annual rate of 10%, with principal due on June 15, 2001.
Interest payments are due monthly in arrears.  The notes are subordinated to the
Company's  senior debt,  which is defined as all  pre-existing  indebtedness for
borrowed money




and certain future  indebtedness for borrowed money (including,  subject to
certain  restrictions,  secured  bank  borrowings  and  borrowed  money  for the
acquisition  of property and capital  equipment)  and trade debt incurred in the
ordinary course of business. If Trimble prepays any portion of the principal, it
is required to pay additional amounts if U.S. Treasury  obligations of a similar
maturity  exceed  a  specified  yield.  Under  the  agreement,  Trimble  is also
restricted from paying dividends.

     The  issuance  of the  subordinated  promissory  notes  also  included  the
issuance of warrants  entitling  holders to  purchase  400,000  shares of common
stock at a price of $10.95 per share at any time through June 15, 2001.  The net
proceeds of the notes were  $29,348,000.  The notes are  recorded as  noncurrent
liabilities,  net of appraised fair value attributed to the warrants.  The value
of the warrants and the issuance costs are being amortized to interest  expense,
using the  interest  rate  method over the term of the  subordinated  promissory
notes. The effective annual interest rate on the notes is 11.5%. Under the terms
of the  note,  Trimble  is  required  to meet a minimum  consolidated  net worth
requirement.   If  Trimble  falls  below  the  minimum  consolidated  net  worth
requirement we could be in default of our loan covenants. Such events could have
a material adverse effect on Trimble's operations and liquidity.

     Trimble  announced in February  1996 that it had  approved a  discretionary
program whereby up to 600,000 shares of its common stock could be repurchased on
the open  market by the  Company to offset  the  potential  dilutive  effects to
earnings  (loss) per share from the issuance of  additional  stock  options.  In
1998,  Trimble approved the repurchase of an additional 1.6 million shares under
the discretionary  program.  During 1997,  Trimble purchased 139,500 shares at a
cost of $1.8 million.  During 1998,  Trimble  purchased 1.08 million shares at a
cost of $16.1 million.  During fiscal 1999, no shares were repurchased under the
discretionary program.

     * Trimble  presently  expects  capital  expenditures  in fiscal  2000 to be
approximately  $5.4 million,  primarily for computer  equipment,  software,  and
leasehold improvements associated with business expansion.

     Trimble  is  continually   evaluating  potential  external  investments  in
technologies  related to its business and, to date,  has made  relatively  small
strategic investments in a number of GPS related technology companies. There can
be no assurance that any such outside investments made to date nor any potential
future investments will be successful.

     * Trimble has evaluated the issues raised by the introduction of the Single
European  Currency (Euro) for initial  implementation as of January 1, 1999, and
during the transition period through January 1, 2002. Trimble does not currently
believe  that the  introduction  of the Euro will have a material  effect on its
foreign exchange and hedging activities. Trimble has also assessed the potential
impact  the  Euro  conversion  will  have  in  regard  to its  internal  systems
accommodating Euro-denominated  transactions.  Trimble will continue to evaluate
the impact of the Euro  introduction  over time,  based on  currently  available
information.  Trimble does not currently  anticipate  any adverse  impact of the
Euro conversion on the Company.

YEAR 2000 IMPACT

Year 2000 Issues

     Computers and software,  as well as other equipment that relied on only two
digits to identify or  represent a year may be unable to  accurately  process or
display certain information at or after the Year 2000. This is commonly referred
to as the "Year 2000  issue."  Trimble is not aware of any year 2000 issues that
have  affected  its  business.  In  preparation  for the year 2000,  we incurred
internal  staff costs as well as consulting  and other  expenses.  The year 2000
expenses for external  services  totaled  less than $1.0  million.  During 1999,
Trimble updated a significant  portion of its computer  software to be year 2000
compliant.

     * Trimble is also not aware of any  material  problems  with  customers  or
suppliers.  Accordingly, Trimble does not anticipate incurring material expenses
or experiencing any material operational disruption as a result of any year 2000
issues.

CERTAIN OTHER RISK FACTORS

     Trimble's  revenues  have  historically  tended to fluctuate on a quarterly
basis due to the timing of shipments of products under contracts and the sale of
licensing rights. A significant  portion of Trimble's  quarterly revenues occurs
from orders received and immediately  shipped to customers in the last few weeks
and days of a quarter.  If





orders are not received,  or if shipments  were to be delayed a few days at
the end of a quarter,  the operating results and reported earnings per share for
that quarter could be significantly  impacted.  Future revenues are difficult to
predict, and projections are based primarily on historical models, which are not
necessarily accurate representations of the future.

     Due to competitive  pressure,  prices of certain of Trimble's products have
declined  substantially since their introduction,  and increased  competition is
likely to result in further  price  reduction  and loss of market  share,  which
could adversely affect our net revenue.

     With the  selection of Solectron  as an  exclusive  manufacturing  partner,
Trimble is  substantially  dependent upon a sole supplier for the manufacture of
its  precision  positioning  and  mobile and timing  technologies  products.  In
addition,  we rely on sole  suppliers  for a number of our critical  ASICS.  The
dependence upon these sole suppliers  subjects  Trimble to risks associated with
an  interruption of supply if we are not able to find  alternative  sources on a
timely basis. There can be no assurance that any delay, disruptions,  or quality
problems  resulting  from the use of a sole  supplier  will not have a  material
adverse effect on Trimble's business and results of operations.

     Trimble's  stock price is subject to  significant  volatility.  If revenues
and/or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community, there
could be an immediate and  significant  impact on the trading price of Trimble's
stock. Additionally,  certain macro-economic factors such as changes in interest
rates could also have an impact on the trading price of Trimble stock.

     The value of  Trimble's  products  relies  substantially  on our  technical
innovation  in fields in which there are many current  patent  filings.  Trimble
recognizes that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the
holders of such patents,  it may be necessary  for us to withdraw  products from
the market,  take a license from such patent holders,  or redesign our products.
Trimble does not believe any of its products currently infringe patents or other
proprietary rights of third parties, but we cannot be certain they do not do so.
In  addition,  the legal  costs  and  engineering  time  required  to  safeguard
intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant
expense of  operations.  Such  events  could have a material  adverse  effect on
Trimble's revenues or profitability.  (See Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.)

     Trimble's future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to
bring new  products to market on a timely  basis.  In some of our markets -- for
example, Land Survey and GIS where we have a market leadership position, a delay
in new product  introductions  could have a significant impact on our results of
operations.  No  assurance  can be given that we will not incur  problems in the
future in innovating and introducing new products.

     Trimble is continuously  evaluating  alliances and external  investments in
technologies  related to its  business,  and has already  entered  into  certain
strategic  alliances and has made relatively  small  strategic  investments in a
number of GPS related technology companies. Acquisitions of companies, divisions
of  companies,  or products  and  alliances  and  strategic  investments  entail
numerous risks,  including (i) the potential inability to successfully integrate
acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies,  economies
of scale, or other value; (ii) diversion of management's  attention;  (iii) loss
of key employees of acquired operations; and (iv) inability to recover strategic
investments  in  development  stage  entities.  Any such  problems  could have a
material adverse effect on Trimble's business,  financial condition, and results
of  operations.  No assurances can be given that we will not incur problems from
current or future alliances,  acquisitions, or investments.  Furthermore,  there
can be no  assurance  that  we  will  realize  value  from  any  such  strategic
alliances, acquisitions, or investments.

     Trimble currently enjoys strong relationships with a few key customers.  An
increasing  amount of our revenue is  generated  from large OEMs such as Philips
VDO, Nortel, Caterpillar, CNH Global (formerly Case Corporation),  and others. A
reduction or loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse
effect on our  financial  condition and results of  operations.  There can be no
assurance  that  Trimble  will  realize  value from these  relationships  in the
future.

     The ability of Trimble to maintain its competitive  technological  position
will depend,  in a large part, on its ability to attract,  motivate,  and retain
highly qualified development and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified
employees in our industry and location is intense, and there can be no assurance
that we will be able to attract,  motivate and retain enough qualified employees
necessary for the future continued development of our business and products.

     Trimble has certain  products that are subject to governmental  and similar
certifications  before  they can be sold.  For  example,  FAA  certification  is
required for all aviation products. Also, Trimble's products that use




integrated  radio  communication  technology  require an end-user to obtain
licensing from the Federal  Communications  Commission (FCC) for  frequency-band
usage.  During the fourth  quarter of 1998,  the FCC  temporarily  suspended the
issuance of licenses for certain of our Real-time  Kinematic products because of
interference with certain other users of similar radio frequencies. An inability
or delay in obtaining such  certifications or FCC's delays could have an adverse
effect on our operating results.

     Trimble's  GPS  technology  is  dependent  on the  use of  radio  frequency
spectrum.   The  assignment  of  spectrum  is  controlled  by  an  international
organization known as the International  Telecommunications Union (ITU). Any ITU
reallocation of radio frequency spectrum,  including frequency band segmentation
or sharing of spectrum,  may  materially  and  adversely  affect the utility and
reliability  of our products,  which would,  in turn,  cause a material  adverse
effect on our operating  results.  In addition,  emissions from mobile satellite
service and other equipment  operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may
materially  and adversely  affect the utility and  reliability  of our products,
which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133, (SFAS 133)  "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 133 will require Trimble to record all
derivatives  held on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives  that are not
hedges  must  be  adjusted  to  fair  value  through  income.  With  respect  to
derivatives which are hedges,  depending on the nature of the hedge,  changes in
the fair value of  derivatives  either will be offset against the change in fair
value of the hedged assets,  liabilities,  or firm commitments through earnings,
or will be  recognized  in other  comprehensive  income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair
value will be immediately  recognized in earnings. In June of 1999 the Financial
Accounting  Standards Board delayed the effective date of implementation for one
year; therefore, SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000.  Trimble  expects to adopt SFAS 133 as of the beginning of its fiscal year
2001. The effect of adopting the SFAS 133 is currently being  evaluated,  but is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on Trimble's  financial  position
or results of operations.

     In December  1999,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  issued staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101). SAB 101 summarizes  certain areas of the
staff's views in applying  generally accepted  accounting  principles to revenue
recognition in financial  statements.  Trimble is currently assessing the impact
of SAB 101, but does not expect that it will have a material  adverse  effect on
Trimble's financial position or results of operations.

Item 7A.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

     The following is a discussion of Trimble's  exposure to market risk related
to changes in interest rates and foreign currency  exchange rates.  Trimble uses
certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. Trimble does not
use derivative  financial  instruments for speculative or trading purposes.  All
financial instruments are used in accordance polices approved by Trimble's board
of directors.

Market Interest Rate Risk

     Short-term  Investments  Owned by the  Company.  As of December  31,  1999,
Trimble  had  short-term   investments  of  $52.7  million.   These   short-term
investments  consisted  of $50.2  million  of highly  liquid  investments,  with
original  maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months and
a $2.5  million  liquid  investment  with an  original  maturity  at the date of
purchase  of 15  months  (See  Note 2 to the  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial
Statements).  These  investments  are  subject  to  interest  rate risk and will
decrease in value if market interest rates  increase.  A hypothetical 10 percent
increase in market interest rates from levels at December 31, 1999,  would cause
the fair value of these  short-term  investments  to  decline  by an  immaterial
amount.  Because  Trimble  has the  ability  to  hold  these  investments  until
maturity,  we would not expect the value of these  investments to be affected to
any  significant  degree  by the  effect of a sudden  change in market  interest
rates.  Declines in interest rates over time will, however,  reduce our interest
income.

     As of January 1, 1999, Trimble had short-term investments of $16.3 million.
These  short-term  investments  consisted  of highly  liquid  investments,  with
original  maturities at the date of purchase  between  three and twelve  months.
(See  Note  2  to  the  Condensed   Consolidated  Financial  Statements.)  These
investments  are  subject to  interest  rate risk and will  decrease in value if
market  interest rates increase.  A hypothetical  10 percent  increase in market
interest  rates from  levels at January 1, 1999,  would  cause the fair value of
these short-term investments to decline by




an  immaterial  amount.  Because  Trimble  has the  ability  to hold  these
investments  until maturity,  we would not expect the value of these investments
to be affected  to any  significant  degree by the effect of a sudden  change in
market  interest  rates.  Declines  in interest  rates over time will,  however,
reduce our interest income.

     Outstanding  Debt of the  Company.  As of December  31, 1999 and January 1,
1999, Trimble had outstanding  long-term debt of approximately  $30.0 million of
subordinated  promissory  notes  at a fixed  interest  rate of 10  percent.  The
interest rate of this instrument is fixed. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in
the  interest  rates would not have a material  impact on Trimble.  Increases in
interest rates could, however,  increase interest expense associated with future
borrowings of Trimble,  if any. We do not currently hedge against  interest rate
increases.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

     Trimble hedges risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order
to  minimize  the  impact of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates on
earnings.  Trimble  utilizes  forward  contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
receivables and payables. These contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in
exchange  rate  movements,  as the  gains and  losses  associated  with  foreign
currency  balances are  generally  offset with the gains and losses on the hedge
contracts.  All hedge  instruments  are marked to market through  earnings every
period.

     *  Trimble  does  not  anticipate  any  material   adverse  effect  on  its
consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy.

     All  contracts  have a maturity of less than one year,  and we do not defer
any gains and  losses,  as they are all  accounted  for through  earnings  every
period.

     The following table provides  information  about Trimble's foreign exchange
forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 1999:



     The following table provides  information  about Trimble's foreign exchange
forward contracts outstanding as of January 1, 1999:



     * The  hypothetical  changes and  assumptions  made above will be different
from what actually occurs in the future.  Furthermore,  the  computations do not
anticipate  actions  that may be  taken  by  Trimble's  management,  should  the
hypothetical  market  changes  actually  occur  over time.  As a result,  actual
earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies:

     Use of estimates.  The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Due  to  the  inherent  nature  of  those
estimates, actual results could differ from expectations.

     Basis  of  presentation.  Trimble  Navigation  Limited  ("Trimble"  or  the
"Company")  fiscal year is an annual  period that varies from 52 to 53 weeks and
always  ends on the Friday  nearest to  December  31,  which for fiscal 1999 was
December 31, 1999.

     Trimble's  fiscal year will normally  consist of four equal  quarters of 13
weeks each, or 52 weeks;  however, due to the fact that there are not exactly 52
weeks in a calendar year and that there is slightly more than one additional day
per year (not  including  the  effects  of leap year) in each  calendar  year as
compared to a 52-week fiscal year, Trimble will have a fiscal year comprising 53
weeks in certain  fiscal  years,  as  determined by when Friday falls closest to
December 31 in consecutive calendar years.

     In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks,  Trimble will record an
extra week of revenues,  costs and related financial  activity.  Therefore,  the
financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated quarter,  having the
extra week, will not be exactly  comparable to the prior and subsequent  52-week
fiscal years, and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. Thus, due to the
inherent  nature of  adopting  a 52-53  week  fiscal  year,  Trimble,  analysts,
shareholders,  investors and others will have to make appropriate adjustments to
any analysis  performed when  comparing the Company's  activities and results in
fiscal years that contain 53 weeks, to those that contain the standard 52 weeks.
Fiscal 1999, 1998, and 1997 were all comprised of 52 weeks.

     Principles of consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Trimble  Navigation  Limited (the  Company) and its wholly owned
subsidiaries  after  elimination  of  all  material  intercompany  balances  and
transactions.

     Foreign currency  translation.  Assets and liabilities of Trimble's foreign
subsidiaries  are translated into U.S.  dollars at year-end  exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are  translated  at average  rates  prevailing  during the
year.  Local  currencies are considered to be the functional  currencies for the
Company's  non-U.S.  subsidiaries.  Translation  adjustments  are  deferred in a
separate component of shareholders'  equity.  Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are included in results of operations as incurred.

     Forward foreign currency exchange  contracts.  Trimble's policy is to hedge
its known exposure to foreign  currency  transactions  to minimize the effect of
changes  in  foreign  currency   exchange  rates  on  consolidated   results  of
operations.  Trimble enters into simple forward  foreign  exchange  contracts to
either buy or sell currency if the net position  exceeds  $400,000.  The forward
foreign exchange contract obligates Trimble to exchange predetermined amounts of
specified foreign  currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates, or
to make an equivalent  U.S.  dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange.
For  contracts  that are  designated  and  effective  as hedges,  discounts,  or
premiums (the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange
rate at inception of the contract) are accreted or amortized to other  operating
expenses over the contract lives, using the straight-line method, while realized
and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the spot exchange rate
(including those from open, matured,  and terminated  contracts) are included in
results of operations.  The related  amounts due to or from  counterparties  are
included in other assets or other  liabilities.  Contract  amounts are marked to
market,  with changes in market value  recorded in earnings as foreign  exchange
gains or losses.  To date,  Trimble has  entered  into  simple  forward  foreign
currency  exchange  contracts to offset the effects of changes in exchange rates
on foreign-denominated  intercompany receivables.  At December 31, 1999, Trimble
had forward foreign currency  exchange  contracts to sell $2,517,000 of Japanese
yen, and  $3,097,000  of European  Currency  units and to buy  $2,257,000 of New
Zealand dollars,  $2,002,000 of British pound sterling, and $657,000 of Japanese
yen, at contracted rates that mature over the next six months.

     Cash and cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents  include all cash and
highly liquid investments with original  maturities of three months or less. The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents  approximates fair value because of
the short maturity of those instruments.




     Short   term/Marketable   securities.   Trimble  has   classified  all  its
short-term/marketable    investments   as    "available-for-sale"    securities.
Available-for-sale  securities  are carried at fair value,  with the  unrealized
holding gains and losses,  net of tax effects,  reported as a separate component
of shareholders'  equity.  Fair value is based on quoted market prices. The cost
of debt  securities  in this  classification  is adjusted  for  amortization  of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.  Such amortization,  as well as
interest,  dividends, and realized gains and losses, is included in interest and
investment  income.  The  cost of  securities  sold  is  based  on the  specific
identification  method.  Trimble has  classified  all  investments as short-term
since it has the intent and ability to redeem them within the year.  (See Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

     Concentration  of credit risk.  In entering into forward  foreign  exchange
contracts,  Trimble  has  assumed  the risk that might  arise from the  possible
inability  of  counterparties  to  meet  the  terms  of  their  contracts.   The
counterparties to these contracts are major multinational  commercial banks, and
Trimble does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults. Trimble
is also exposed to credit risk in its accounts  receivable and performs  ongoing
credit  evaluations of its customers and generally does not require  collateral.
The expenses recorded for doubtful accounts  receivable were $1,875,000 in 1999,
$195,000 in 1998, and $315,000 in 1997.

     Inventories.  Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower of  standard  cost or
market. Standard costs approximate average actual costs.

     Revenue recognition. Trimble recognizes revenue from product sales when the
products are shipped to the customer, title has transferred,  and no significant
obligations  remain.  Trimble also  requires the  following:  (i) execution of a
written  customer  order,  (ii) delivery of the product,  (iii) fee is fixed and
determinable,   and  (iv)  collectibility  of  the  proceeds  is  probable.   In
circumstances where the customer has delayed their acceptance of our product, we
defer recognition of revenue until acceptance.  Revenues from purchased extended
warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term
of the  warranty/support  period.  Substantially  all  technology  licenses  and
research  revenue have consisted of initial  license fees and  royalties,  which
were recognized when earned, when Trimble had no remaining obligations.

     In fiscal 1999,  Trimble  adopted  Statement of Position 97-2 (SOP 97-2) as
set forth by FASB,  "Software Revenue  Recognition," which requires that revenue
recognized  from  software  arrangements  be  allocated  to each  element of the
arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements,  such as software
products, upgrades, enhancements,  post-contract customer support, installation,
or training.  Revenue from  post-contract  customer  support (PCS) is recognized
ratably over the period of the PCS agreement. However, PCS revenue is recognized
immediately  upon the sale of the software when the PCS  arrangement  is for one
year or less. The  implementation  of SOP 97-2 did not have a material impact on
the recognized revenue of the Company.

     In December  1998,  the AICPA issued SOP 98-9,  Modifications  of SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue  Recognition,  with respect to Certain  Transactions.  SOP 98-9
amends SOP 97-2 Software Revenue  Recognition to require  recognition of revenue
using the  "residual  method"  when certain  criteria  are met.  Trimble will be
required to implement  these  provisions  of SOP 98-9 for its fiscal year ending
December 31, 2000.  SOP 98-9 also amends SOP 98-4,  an earlier  amendment to SOP
97-2,  which extended the deferral of the application of certain passages of SOP
97-2.  Trimble  does not  believe the impact of SOP 98-9 will be material to its
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     Trimble  accounts for long-term  contracts on the  percentage of completion
method,  and income is recognized as work on contracts  progress,  but estimated
losses on contracts in progress are immediately charged to operations.

     In December  1999,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  issued staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101). SAB 101 summarizes  certain areas of the
staff's views in applying  generally accepted  accounting  principles to revenue
recognition in financial  statements.  Trimble is currently assessing the impact
of SAB 101, but does not expect that it will have a material  adverse  effect on
Trimble's financial position or results of operations.

     Product warranty. Trimble provides for estimated warranty costs at the time
of sale.  The warranty  period is generally  for one year from date of shipment,
except for air  transport  products,  for which the period is  generally a basic
three-year  warranty period with an additional  two-year warranty sold with some
units.  In addition,  select  military  programs may require  extended  warranty
periods.




     Advertising costs.  Trimble expenses the production costs of advertising as
incurred.  Advertising expenses were $4,229,000,  $6,490,000,  and $6,328,000 in
fiscal 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

     Research and Development and Engineering Costs.  Research,  development and
engineering costs are charged to expense when incurred. The Company has received
third party funding of $7.1million  $2.9 million and $6.4 million in 1999,  1998
and 1997,  respectively.  The  Company  has  offset  research,  development  and
engineering  expenses by the third party funding,  as the third party funding is
based upon research and  development  expenditures  and the Company  retains the
rights to any technology that is developed.

     Stock  compensation.  In  accordance  with the  provisions  of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation,"  Trimble  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) and related  Interpretations
in accounting for its stock option plans and stock  purchase plan.  Accordingly,
it does not recognize  compensation  cost for stock options  granted at or above
market.  Note 13 to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  describes the plans
operated by Trimble, and contains a summary of the pro forma effects to reported
net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for fiscal 1999,  1998, and 1997
as if Trimble had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value
of the options granted at grant date, as prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation  of  property  and  equipment  owned  or  under
capitalized  leases is computed using the straight-line  method over the shorter
of the estimated useful lives or the lease terms.  Useful lives range from three
years for machinery and equipment to five years for furniture and fixtures.

     Intangible  Assets.  Intangible  assets  consist of  patents,  license  and
trademarks.  Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated lives, generally periods of four years or less.

     Long-lived Assets. In accordance with Financial  Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 121,  "Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-lived  Assets and  Long-lived  Assets to be Disposed Of",
the carrying value of intangible  assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed
on a regular  basis for the existence of facts or  circumstances,  both internal
and external, that may suggest impairment.

     Interest.  All  interest  costs  incurred  have been  charged  to  interest
expense.

     Earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings per share represents the weighted
average  common shares  outstanding  during the period and excludes any dilutive
effects of options,  warrants, and convertible securities.  The dilutive effects
of  options,  warrants,  and  convertible  securities  are  included  in diluted
earnings per share.

     New accounting standards.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  (SFAS 133)
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities."  SFAS 133 will
require  Trimble to record all  derivatives  held on the  balance  sheet at fair
value.  Derivatives  that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value  through
income. With respect to derivatives which are hedges, depending on the nature of
the  hedge,  changes  in the fair  value of  derivatives  either  will be offset
against  the  change in fair value of the hedged  assets,  liabilities,  or firm
commitments  through  earnings,  or will be  recognized  in other  comprehensive
income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion
of a  derivative's  change  in fair  value  will be  immediately  recognized  in
earnings.  In June of 1999 the Financial  Accounting Standards Board delayed the
effective date of implementation for one year; therefore,  SFAS 133 is effective
for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2000.  Trimble expects to adopt SFAS
133 as of the beginning of its fiscal year 2001. The effect of adopting the SFAS
133 is currently being evaluated, but is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on Trimble's financial position or results of operations.

Note 2 - Short term investments:

     All  marketable  securities  are intended by management to be available for
sale and are reported at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported
within shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are recorded based on the
specific  identification method. The carrying amount of Trimble's investments is
shown in the table below:





     At December 31, 1999, investments with scheduled maturities within one year
were $50.2  million  and for  maturities  between  one to three  years were $2.5
million.  At January 1, 1999,  investments with scheduled  maturities within one
year were $16.3 million and for maturities between one to three years was $0.

Note 4 - Disposition of assets:

     On August  10,  1999,  Trimble  signed  an Asset  Purchase  Agreement  with
Solectron  Corporation  and  Solectron  Federal  Systems,  Inc.   (collectively,
"Solectron"). The closing of the transaction occurred on August 13, 1999. At the
closing  of the Asset  Purchase  Agreement,  Trimble  transferred  to  Solectron
substantially  all  of  Trimble's  tangible   manufacturing  assets  located  at
Trimble's Sunnyvale,  California campus, including but not limited to equipment,
fixtures and work in progress,  and certain contract and other intangible assets
and rights, together with certain related obligations, including but not limited
to real property  subleases covering  Trimble's  manufacturing  floor space, and
outstanding  purchase  order  commitments.   In  addition,  the  Asset  Purchase
Agreement also provided for Solectron's subsequent purchase, on August 30, 1999,
of Trimble's entire component inventory, on hand as of August 13, 1999.

     The final  purchase  price for these assets was $26.9  million.  As part of
this agreement Trimble incurred some employee and facility related  liabilities,
which have been  accrued  for and offset  against  the gain on the sale of these
assets.  The net gain on the  transaction  to Trimble of $5.9  million  has been
deferred  and is being  recognized  over the  three-year  exclusive  life of the
Supply Agreement described below.

     Concurrently with the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement,  Trimble and
Solectron also entered into a Supply  Agreement.  The Supply Agreement  provides
for the exclusive  manufacture by Solectron of almost all Trimble products for a
period  of three  years.  Solectron  will  initially  manufacture  such  Trimble
products under the Supply Agreement in the same Trimble  buildings in which such
products were previously  manufactured  by Trimble,  and Trimble has sublet such
space to Solectron as part of this transaction.  Solectron offered employment to
approximately  230  Trimble  manufacturing,   engineering  and  related  support
personnel,  and  Trimble  understands  that  substantially  all  such  employees
accepted such employment with Solectron.

Note 5 - The Company, industry segment, geographic, and customer information:

     Effective   January  1,  1999,   Trimble  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  131,   "Disclosures  about  Segments  of  an
Enterprise and Related  Information."  The Statement  requires Trimble to report
segment  financial  information  consistent  with the  presentation  made to the
Company's management for decision-making purposes.

     Trimble  operates in a single industry segment as a leader in designing and
developing  innovative  products enabled by GPS technology.  We provide end-user
and Original  Equipment  Manufacture  solutions for diverse  applications in our
target markets. These applications include:

     Research and development  activities are conducted at Trimble's  facilities
in Sunnyvale,  California,  and Christchurch,  New Zealand.  Solectron currently
manufactures  most of Trimble's  products.  In addition we have a  manufacturing
facility  in Austin,  Texas  primarily  focused on FAA  certified  products  for
commercial aviation and military systems.

     To achieve distribution,  marketing,  production, and technology advantages
for our  targeted  markets we manage our  industry  segment  within two Business
Units:  the  Precision  Positioning  Group  (PPG)  and  the  Mobile  and  Timing
Technologies  (MTT) Group.  Each Business Unit is managed by a group senior vice
president who is responsible for strategy,  marketing,  product  development and
financial performance.

     The  Precision   Positioning  Group  derives  its  revenue  from  precision
positioning  solutions for the architecture,  engineering,  construction,  asset
management,  and agriculture  markets.  These markets require  sub-centimeter to
meter  3D   positioning   accuracy   for   surveying,   mapping,   and   machine
guidance/control  applications. The Mobile and Timing Technologies Group derives
its revenues from automotive,  timing,  fleet management,  commercial  aviation,
military systems and from development of software  licenses and other rights for
the use of our GPS technology to third parties. Trimble evaluates these Business
Units'  performance  and  allocates  resources  based on  profit  and loss  from
operations before income taxes.

     The  accounting  policies  applied by each of the  markets  are the same as
those used by Trimble in general.

     The table on the following page presents revenues, operating income (loss),
and identifiable  assets by Trimble's Business Units. There is no recognition of
inter-Business  Unit sales or  transfers.  Operating  income (loss) is net sales
less operating expenses,  excluding general corporate expenses,  interest income
(expense),  and income  taxes.  The  identifiable  assets that  Trimble's  Chief
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) views by industry market are accounts receivable
and inventory.  Trimble does not report depreciation and amortization or capital
expenditures by industry markets to the CODM.









     Following are  reconciliations  corresponding to totals in the accompanying

     The geographic  distribution of Trimble's revenues and identifiable  assets
by fiscal year-end are summarized in the table below in thousands.

(1) Sales attributed to countries based on the location of the customer.

     Transfers  between  U.S.  and foreign  geographic  areas are made at prices
based on total costs and  contributions  of the supplying  geographic  area. The
Company's  subsidiaries  in the Pacific Rim and Asia have  derived  revenue from
commissions  from domestic  operations in each of the periods  presented.  These
commission  revenues and expenses are excluded  from total revenue and operating
income (loss) in the preceding table.  Sales to unaffiliated  customers in Japan
are made by the Company's Japanese subsidiary.

     No single customer accounted for 10% or more of Trimble's total revenues in
fiscal 1999, 1998 or 1997.

Note 6 - Discontinued operations:

     On October 2,  1998,  Trimble  adopted a plan to  discontinue  its  General
Aviation division.  Accordingly, the General Aviation division is being reported
as a  discontinued  operation  for all  periods  presented  in  these  financial
statements.  Net assets of the  discontinued  operation at October 2, 1998, were
written off and consisted primarily of inventory, property, plant and equipment,
and intangible assets.

     The original  estimated loss on the disposal of the discontinued  operation
in fiscal  1998 was $19.9  million,  but was  adjusted in March 1999 for certain
product lines that were retained (see further  discussion  below).  The adjusted
estimated  loss on the  disposal  is $20.3  million.  The  original  fiscal 1998
estimate  included a write-off of net assets of $12.7 million and a provision of
$7.2  million for costs of disposal,  including  severance  costs,  facility and
certain other  contractual  costs, and anticipated  operating losses through the
estimated  date of disposal.  The  adjusted  fiscal 1999  estimate  included the
write-off  of net assets of $12.7  million and a provision  of $7.6  million for
costs of  disposal,  including  severance  costs,  facility  and  certain  other
contractual  costs, and anticipated  operating losses through the estimated date
of disposal.



     The net assets, which were written off in 1998, are summarized as follows:

     As of December 31, 1999, in connection  with the  discontinued  operations,
Trimble had incurred  cumulative  net expenses of  approximately  $6.1  million,
consisting of $6.6 million for operating losses for the  discontinued  operation
through the estimated  date of disposal,  including  severance  costs and net of
receipts of $543,000 related to the sale of particular inventory items and fixed
assets.  In the third  quarter of 1999  Trimble  had revised its accrual for the
remaining  costs now  expected to be  incurred,  based on current  status of the
related  liabilities.  This resulted in a reversal of approximately $2.9 million
of prior amounts accrued, related to the discontinued operations.  Trimble has a
remaining  provision  of $2.2  million,  which  includes  $1.1  million  for the
estimated operating losses for service and warranty support, including remaining
severance  costs,  and $1.1 million for facility and certain  other  contractual
costs.

     On March 31,  1999,  Trimble made the  decision to retain  certain  product
lines  included  within the  General  Aviation  division  which were part of the
previously planned  discontinued  operation.  The basis of the decision was that
these  products  use common raw  materials  and labor  which are  necessary  for
Trimble's Air Transport products and, therefore,  these particular product lines
could be retained without adding additional overhead from the overhead currently
required for the Air Transport  products.  The revenues and costs related to the
products  retained have been included in the results of operations of continuing
operations in the periods presented.

     The net revenues of the  discontinued  operation -- revenues that have been
restated  to exclude  the  retained  product  lines -- are not  included  in net
revenues of continuing operations in the accompanying  statements of operations.
The operating  results for the fiscal years ended January 1, 1999 and January 2,
1998, of the discontinued operation are summarized as follows:

Note 7 - Bank line of credit:

     In August 1997,  Trimble entered into a three-year,  $50,000,000  unsecured
revolving credit facility with four banks (the "Credit  Agreement").  The Credit
Agreement  enables  Trimble to borrow up to  $50,000,000,  provided that certain
financial and other covenants are met. As of October 20, 1999, the Company,  the
Agent and the  Lenders  agreed to change  and amend  certain  covenants  for the
remaining  life of the loan,  which expires in August of 2000.  The  $50,000,000
revolving  credit  facility was modified to include the Company's prior separate
$5,000,000  line of credit and to simplify  the entire  arrangement.  The Credit
Agreement  provides for payment of a commitment  fee of 0.25% and  borrowings to
bear  interest at 1% over LIBOR if the total  funded debt to EBITDA is less than
or equal to 1.00 times, 0.3% and borrowings to bear interest at 1.25% over LIBOR
if the ratio is greater than 1.00 times and less than or equal to 2.00 times, or
0.4% and borrowings to bear interest at 1.75% over LIBOR if the ratio is greater
than 2.00 times. In addition to borrowing at the specified  LIBOR rate,  Trimble
has the right to borrow  with  interest  at the




higher of (i) one of the  bank's  annual  prime  rate and (ii) the  federal
funds  rate  plus  0.5%.  To date,  Trimble  has made no  borrowings  under  the
$50,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility,  but has issued certain letters
of credit as of December  31,  1999  amounting  to  approximately  $283,000.  In
addition,  Trimble is restricted  from paying  dividends  under the terms of the
Credit Agreement.

Note 8 - Restructuring charges:

     In fiscal 1998,  Trimble  recorded  restructuring  charges  totaling  $10.3
million in operating expenses.

     These charges were a result of Trimble's reorganization activities, through
which the Company has downsized its operations, including reducing headcount and
facilities space usage, and has canceled its enterprise-wide  information system
project and  certain  research  and  development  projects.  The impact of these
decisions  was that  significant  amounts of  Trimble's  fixed  assets,  prepaid
expenses,  and purchased  technology have been impaired and certain  liabilities
incurred.  Trimble wrote down the related assets to their net realizable  values
and made provisions for the estimated liabilities.

     The activity in fiscal 1999 and 1998 related to the  restructuring  and the
amounts  remaining at December 31, 1999, on the balance sheet are as follows (in
thousands):


     The  cash  expenditures  associated  with  the  remaining  obligations  are
expected to occur primarily in fiscal 2000.

Note 9 - Long-term debt and other noncurrent liabilities:

     In June 1994, Trimble issued $30.0 million of subordinated promissory notes
bearing  interest at an annual rate of 10%, with principal due on June 15, 2001.
Interest payments are due monthly in arrears.  The notes are subordinated to the
Company's  senior debt,  which is defined as all  preexisting  indebtedness  for
borrowed money and certain future  indebtedness  for borrowed money  (including,
subject to certain restrictions,  secured bank borrowings and borrowed money for
the  acquisition  of property and capital  equipment) and trade debt incurred in
the  ordinary  course  of  business.  If  Trimble  prepays  any  portion  of the
principal, it is required to pay additional amounts if U.S. Treasury obligations
of a similar maturity exceed a specified yield. Under the agreement,  Trimble is
restricted from paying dividends.

     The  issuance  of the  subordinated  promissory  notes  also  included  the
issuance of warrants  entitling  holders to  purchase  400,000  shares of common
stock at a price of $10.95 per share at any time through June 15, 2001.  The net
proceeds of the notes were $29.3  million.  The notes are recorded as noncurrent
liabilities,  net of appraised fair value attributed to the warrants.  The value
of the warrants and the issuance costs are being amortized to interest  expense,
using the  interest  rate  method over the term of the  subordinated  promissory
notes. The effective annual interest rate on the notes is 11.5%. Under the terms
of the  note,  Trimble  is  required  to meet a minimum




consolidated  net worth  requirement.  If Trimble  falls  below the minimum
consolidated net worth requirement we could be in default of our loan covenants.
Such events could have a material  adverse  effect on Trimble's  operations  and
liquidity.

     Other  long-term  debt  represents   deferred  rent   obligations,   rental
inducements on certain of Trimble's leased facilities, and installment loans for
a fixed  asset  purchase.  There are  three  installment  loans for  capitalized
software,  which in total have two annual  payments of $1.4  million.  The first
installment  loan  consists of two payments of $129,500.  The first  payment was
made on May 30, 1999,  and the second payment is due on May 30, 2000. The second
installment  loan  consists of two payments of $942,800.  The first  payment was
made on May 30, 1999,  and the second  payment is due on May 30, 2000. The third
installment  loan  consists of two payments of $315,900.  The first  payment was
made on May 1,  1999,  and the second  payment is due on May 1, 2000.  The lease
agreements  provide for scheduled  increases in lease payments over the terms of
the leases.

Note 10 - Lease obligations and commitments:

     Trimble's  principal  facilities  in the United  States  are  leased  under
noncancelable  operating  leases that expire at various  dates from 2000 through
2004.  Trimble has options to renew  certain of these  leases for an  additional
five years. The Company's United Kingdom  subsidiary  leases a facility under an
operating lease that expires in 2005.

 Future minimum payments required under noncancelable operating leases
 are as follows:

Note 11 - Fair value of financial instruments:

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments" requires disclosure of the following information
about the fair value of certain financial  instruments for which it is currently
practicable to estimate such value.  None of the financial  instruments are held
or  issued  for  trading  purposes.  The  carrying  amounts  and fair  values of
Trimble's financial instruments are as follows:


     The fair  value of the  subordinated  notes  has  been  estimated  using an
estimate of the interest  rate Trimble  would have had to pay on the issuance of
notes with a similar maturity,  and discounting the cash flows at that rate. The
fair values do not give an indication of the amount that Trimble would currently
have to pay to extinguish any of this debt.



     The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated, based on
quoted market prices of comparable  contracts,  and these contracts are restated
to the fair value at the end of every month.

Note 13 - Shareholder's Equity:

     1993 Stock Option Plan. In 1992,  Trimble's Board of Directors  adopted the
1993 Stock  Option  Plan  (1993  Plan).  The 1993  Plan,  as amended to date and
approved  by   shareholders,   provides  for  the  granting  of  incentive   and
nonstatutory  stock  options  for up to  5,000,000  shares  of  Common  Stock to
employees,  consultants  and  directors  of Trimble.  At  Trimble's  2000 annual
meeting of shareholders to be held on May 11, 2000, the  shareholders  are being
asked to approve and increase of 925,000  shares under the 1993 Plan.  Incentive
stock  options may be granted at exercise  prices that are not less than 100% of
the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant.  All employee  stock
options granted under the 1993 Plan have 120-month  terms, and vest at a rate of
20% at the first anniversary of grant, and monthly  thereafter at an annual rate
of 20%,  with full vesting  occurring  at the fifth  anniversary  of grant.  The
exercise price of nonstatutory  stock options issued under the 1993 Plan must be
at least 85% of the fair market value of Common  Stock on the date of grant.  As
of December 31, 1999,  options to purchase 3,685,321 shares were outstanding and
631,822 shares were available for future grant under the 1993 Stock Option Plan.

     1990  Director  Stock  Option Plan.  In December  1990,  Trimble  adopted a
Director  Stock Option Plan under which an aggregate of 380,000 shares of Common
Stock have been  reserved  for  issuance  to date to  nonemployee  directors  as
approved by the shareholders.  At December 31, 1999, options to purchase 198,333
shares were outstanding and 95,833 shares were available for future grants under
the Director Stock Option Plan.

     1992  Management  Discount  Stock Option Plan. In 1992  Trimble's  Board of
Directors  approved the 1992  Management  Discount Stock Option Plan  ("Discount
Plan").  Under the  Discount  Plan,  300,000  nonstatutory  stock  options  were
reserved  for grant to  management  employees  at  exercise  prices  that may be
significantly discounted from the fair market value of Common Stock on the dates
of grant.  Options are generally  exercisable six months from the date of grant.
As of December 31, 1999,  there were 4,974 shares  available for future  grants.
For accounting  purposes,  compensation  cost on these grants is measured by the
excess over the  discounted  exercise  prices of the fair market value of Common
Stock on the dates of option grant. Noncash compensation cost related to options
exercised  in fiscal  1999,  1998,  and 1997  amounted to $0, $0, and  $275,000,
respectively. As of December 31, 1999, 125,000 shares were outstanding.

     1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In 1988, Trimble established an employee
stock purchase plan under which an aggregate of 2,950,000 shares of Common Stock
have been  reserved  for sale to eligible  employees  to date as approved by the
shareholders. At Trimble's 2000 annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May
11, 2000,  the  shareholders  are being asked to approve and increase of 200,000
shares under the  employee  stock  purchase  plan.  The plan  permits  full-time
employees to purchase  Common Stock  through  payroll  deductions  at 85% of the
lower of the fair market  value of the Common  Stock at the  beginning or at the
end of each  six-month  offering  period.  In fiscal 1999,  317,210  shares were
issued under the plan for aggregate proceeds to the Company of $2.5 million.  At
December  31,  1999,  the number of shares  reserved  for future  purchases  was
685,632.

     As stated in Note 1 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements,  Trimble has
elected to follow  APB 25 and  related  Interpretations  in  accounting  for its
employee  stock options and stock purchase  plans.  The  alternative  fair value
accounting  provided for under SFAS 123 requires  use of option  pricing  models
that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25,
because the exercise price of Trimble's employee stock options equals the market
price of the  underlying  stock on date of grant,  no  compensation  expense  is
recognized.

     Pro forma  information  regarding  net  income  and  earnings  per share is
required by SFAS 123 and has been determined as if Trimble had accounted for its
employee  stock options and  purchases  under the Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan
using the fair value method of that Statement.  The fair value for these options
was estimated at the date of grant using a  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model
with the following weighted-average assumptions for fiscal 1999, 1998, and 1997:





     The  Black-Scholes   option  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating  the fair value of traded  options that have no vesting  restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.  Because  Trimble's  employee  stock  options  have  characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's  opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of its employee stock options.

     For  purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is  amortized  to expense  over the  options'  vesting  period,  and the
estimated  fair value of purchases  under the Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan is
expensed  in the year of  purchase.  The  effects  on pro  forma  disclosure  of
applying FAS 123 are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma
disclosure of future years. Trimble's pro forma information (in thousands except
for per share data) is as follows:



     Exercise  prices for options  outstanding  as of December 31, 1999,  ranged
from $8.00 to $29.63.  The weighted average remaining  contractual life of those
options is 7.81  years.  In view of the wide range of exercise  prices,  Trimble
considers it  appropriate  to provide the following  additional  information  in
respect of options outstanding:





     Activity  during fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 under the combined plans was as
follows:


     401(k) Plan.  Under Trimble's 401(k) Plan, U.S.  employee  participants may
direct the  investment of  contributions  to their accounts among certain mutual
funds and the Trimble  Navigation  Limited Common Stock Fund. The Fund purchased
47,066 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate of $504,000 in 1999.  Trimble, at
its discretion, matches individual employee 401(k) Plan contributions up to $100
per month. Trimble's matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $1.0 million
in fiscal 1999, $1.2 million in 1998, and $1.0 million in 1997.

     Profit-Sharing Plan. In 1995, Trimble introduced an employee profit-sharing
plan in  which  all  employees,  excluding  executives  and  certain  levels  of
management,  participate.  The plan distributes to employees approximately 5% of
quarterly income before taxes. Payments under the plan during fiscal 1999, 1998,
and 1997 were $1.2 million, $138,000, and $549,000, respectively.

     Warrants.  On May 3, 1999 Trimble  granted  30,000  warrants at an exercise
price of $9.75,  which  expire on March 29,  2004.  As of  December  31, 1999 no
warrants had been exercised.

     Common  shares  reserved  for future  issuances.  As of December  31, 1999,
Trimble had  reserved  5,426,915  common  shares for issuance  upon  exercise of
options outstanding and options available for grant under the 1993 Stock Option,
1990 Director Stock Option, and 1992 Management Discount Stock Option plans, and
available for issuance under the 1988 Employee Stock Purchase plan.





Note 14 - Earnings per share:

     In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." Trimble adopted
this standard,  as required for its January 2, 1998, Financial  Statements.  For
the years presented, Trimble presents both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per
share.

     The following data show the amounts used in computing  earnings  (loss) per
share and the  effect  on the  weighted-average  number  of  shares of  dilutive
potential Common Stock.


     If  Trimble  had  reported  net  income  in  1998,  additional  387  common
equivalent  shares related to  outstanding  options and warrants would have been
included in the calculation of diluted loss per share.

Note 15 - Comprehensive income (loss):

     As of January 3, 1998,  Trimble adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  130  (SFAS  130),  "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income."  SFAS 130
establishes new rules for the reporting and displaying of comprehensive  income.
SFAS 130 requires unrealized gains or losses on the Company's available-for-sale
securities   and   cumulative   translation   adjustments   to  be  included  in
comprehensive  income. The components of accumulated other comprehensive  income
(loss), net of related tax include:




Note 16 - Statement of cash flow data:


Note 17 - Litigation:

     Settled Matters. On December 6, 1995, two shareholders filed a class action
lawsuit  against the Company and certain  directors and officers of the Company.
Subsequent to that date,  additional  lawsuits were filed by other shareholders.
The lawsuits were  subsequently  amended and  consolidated  into one  complaint,
which was filed on April 5, 1996. The amended  consolidated  complaint sought to
bring an action as a class action  consisting  of all persons who  purchased the
Common Stock of the Company during the period April 18, 1995,  through  December
5, 1995 (the "Class Period").  The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants sought
to induce the members of the Class to purchase the Company's Common Stock during
the  Class  Period  at  artificially  inflated  prices.  The  plaintiffs  sought
recissory or compensatory  damages with interest thereon,  as well as reasonable
attorneys'  fees and  extraordinary  equitable  and/or  injunctive  relief.  The
parties  negotiated a definitive  stipulation of settlement,  which was formally
approved,  by  the  court  on  September  23,  1999.  The  final  court-approved
settlement  was funded by insurance  proceeds and payment by the Company of $1.8
million.  The entire  amount of the  Company's  obligation  has been  previously
reserved,  and the final  settlement  did not  adversely  effect  the  Company's
financial position or results of operations.

     Pending Matters. On November 12, 1998, the Company brought suit in district
court in San Jose,  California,  against Silicon RF Technology,  Inc. (SiRF) for
alleged patent  infringement of three Trimble  patents.  Trimble and SiRF have a
negotiated a settlement which includes cross licensing.

     Other  Matters.   Western  Atlas,  a  Houston-based  supplier  to  the  oil
exploration  business,  has accused  the  Company  and other GPS  manufacturers,
suppliers,  and users of  infringing  two U.S.  Patents owned by it, namely U.S.
Patent Nos.  5,014,066 and 5,619,212.  Western Atlas contends that the foregoing
patents cover certain aspects of GPS receiver design.  Lawsuits for infringement
of these two patents  were filed in federal  district  court in  Houston,  Texas
against Rockwell  International  Corp. and Garmin  International  Inc., and both
have  settled.  Although  Trimble  has not  been  sued by  Western  Atlas on the
foregoing  patents,  the  Company  has  instructed  its  counsel  thoroughly  to
investigate the infringement  threat.  At the present time, the Company does not
expect this threat to have adverse consequences on the Company's business.

     On January 31,  1997,  counsel for one Philip M. Clegg wrote to the Company
asserting that a license under Mr. Clegg's U.S. Patent No. 4,807,131,  which was
issued  February 21, 1989,  would be required by the Company  because of a joint
venture  that  the  Company  had  previously   entered  into  with   Caterpillar
Corporation  concerning  the use of Trimble  GPS  products in  combination  with
earth-moving  equipment.  To date, no infringement  action has been initiated on
behalf  of Mr.  Clegg.  The  Company  believes  that  there  will be no  adverse
consequences to the Company as a result of this inquiry.

     The Company is also a party to other  disputes  incidental to its business.
The Company  believes that the ultimate  liability of the Company as a result of
such disputes,  if any, would not be material to its overall financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.




Note 18 - Selected quarterly financial data (unaudited):


     Significant quarterly items include the following: (i) in the third quarter
of 1998 Trimble recorded a $2.5 million restructuring charge, (ii) in the fourth
quarter of 1998 Trimble recorded a $7.8 million restructuring charge.

for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial  statements  and schedule  referred to above
