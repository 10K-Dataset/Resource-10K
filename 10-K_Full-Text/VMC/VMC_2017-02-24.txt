VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION

We ar

e th

largest

supplier

of construction aggregates

in the country with

coast-to-coast

aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:

§

a

favorable geographic footprint

serving nearly all key growth corridors and

the

most rapidly growing population centers

§

a pure-play aggregates business with one of the largest proven and probable reserve bases in the U.S.

§

strong local leadership and autonomy coupled with company-wide performance goals and improvement

﻿

These factors, together with our strong operating expertise and price discipline, allow

ed

us to deliver

a 14% increase ($4.81 compared to $4.24) in Aggregates segment unit gross profit per ton in 2016.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Part I


We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow

more

rapidly and

by

divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 201

expanded our

aggregates distribution capabilities

in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas.

W

here practical, we have operations located

close to our local markets because the cost of trucking

materials long distances is prohibitive.

Approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively

from the producing location to the customer

by truck, and another


%

are delivered by truck after reaching a

sales

yard by rail or water

.

The remaining


% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

We provide

the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to

maintain and

expand the U.S. economy.

We operate primarily in the U.S. and

are t

he nation’s largest

supplier

of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

Our strategy

and competitive advantage are

based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in

most

types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and a

irports that connect us, and to

build the hospitals,

s

chools,

shopping centers,

are

critical to

our

long-term success

. They

are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that

are expected to

require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand.

Moreover, there are significant

barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

SIZE AND SCALE

:

Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular

geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce

saleable aggregates and provide customer

service.

We are

t

he largest aggregates

supplier

in the U.S. Our


active aggregates facilities as of December 31, 201


,

provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting,

procurement

, technical support and engineering.

Part I


2.

COAST-TO-COAST FOOTPRINT

Demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly. Our strategic locations serve


of the top 25

highest-growth

U.S. metropolitan areas

in


states

plus the District of Columbia

PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our

long-term

growth is a result of

strategic

acquisition

s a

nd

investments in key operations

.

Strategic

acquisitions

AND DISPOSITIONS

:

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California

and

Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt

mix. In

2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and

our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in

other southeastern and

m

id-Atlantic

states

. In 2014, we completed eight transactions that expanded our aggregates

busin

ess in Arizona, California, New

Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.

C.

and

our

asphalt mix

business in Arizona and New Mexic

o

.

In 2015, we

completed an asset exchange transaction in which we

exited our ready-mixed concrete business in California

and

further expanded our

asphalt

mix business in

Arizona.

Additionally, throughout our history

we have completed many bolt-on acquisitions that have c

ontributed significantly to our growth.

For example, in 201


we completed strategic bolt-on acquisitions in

New Mexico and Texas.

MANAGING VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICE TO GROW PROFITABILITY

We

focus on three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination.

§

Price for Service

—

We seek to receive full and fair value for the quality of products and service we provide. We should be paid appropriately for helping our customers be successful.

§

Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

We focus on rigorous cost management throughout the economic cycle. Small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions.

§

Sales and Production Mix

—

We adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions. Managing inventories responsibly results in improved cost performance and an improved return on capital.

We manage these factors locally, and align our talent and incentives accordingly. Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively. Recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit drivers.

﻿

﻿

A

ggregates segment gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past

few

years

and

we

expect continuing improvement in unit profitability.

§

On Price for Service

—

Our expanding margins will continue to benefit from the compounding pricing gains associated with cyclical recoveries.

§

On Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

We are operating a capital-intensive business

well below full

capacity and are extremely well positioned to further leverage fixed costs to sales as we move forward.

§

On Sales and Production Mix

—

As the recovery continues and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity in the

end-use

mix, we will sell the entire production mix much more efficiently and at fuller value.

5.

EFFECTIVE

LA

ND MANAGEMENT

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning

because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue t

o fo

cus our actions on

prudent

decisions regarding the life cycle management of

the land we own.

1. AGGREGATES

Our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways:

§

as a base material underneath highways, walkways, airport runways, parking lots and railroads

§

to aid in water filtration, purification and erosion control

§

as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life including:

§

houses and apartments

§

roads, bridges and parking lots

§

schools and hospitals

§

commercial buildings and retail space

§

sewer systems

§

airports and runways

Part I


Factors that affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our busine

ss i

nclude:

§

Local markets:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases,

must be

produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited sup

plies of locally available high-

quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to long-haul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan

Peninsula with our

fleet of Panamax-class, self-unloading ships

.

We operate an extensive logistics network along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard as shown below:

﻿

﻿

﻿

§

Lo

cation and quality of reserves:

We

currently ha

ve

15.5

billion

tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other developmen

t. Z

oning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restriction

s c

urtail expansion in certain areas, but th

ey al

so increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

§

Demand cycles:

Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short-

term

and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new historical high.

Part I


Source: Company estimates

﻿

§

Flexible production capabilities:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

Highly fragmented industry:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over

6,000

companies that manage

more than 11,000

operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

Limited product substitution:

There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, due to technical specifications many types of construction projects cannot

be served by recycled concret

e

and

require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities. Moreover, the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications.

§

raw material inputs largely under our control:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.

AGGREGATES MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with above-average long-term expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail, barge or ship to a particular end market. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

Public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatel

y-f

unded construction, and generally requires

more aggregates per dollar of construction spending.

Private sector construction

(primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically

is

more affected by general

economic cycles than

p

ublicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges

), w

hich

tend to

receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

Part I


PUBLIC SECTOR

CONSTRUCTION

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways,

bridges

, buildings

, airports, schools and

prisons

as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and

private sources. In 2016

, publicly funded construction

accounted for

approximately


%

of

our total aggregates

shipments

,

and

approximately


%

of

our aggregates sales by volume

were

used in highway construction projects.

§

Public Sector Funding:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction

spending;

public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates an

d s

pending

has historically been supported by multi-year

laws, which provide certainty and funding amounts, program structures, and rules and regulations

.

Federal spending is governed by authorization, budget and appropriations laws. The level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. Since 2013, seventeen states have increased taxes on motor fuel to support needed transportation investments. In 2016, five state legislatures approved one-time funding for transportation, and three state legislatures passed bills providing recurring funding resources. To cap off state and local action, 2016 was another banner election year for transportation-related measures at the ballot box: 74% of local and state measures passed — consistent with the trend of the last 10 years.

§

federal highway funding

:

I

n Decemb

e

r 2

015,

President

Obama

signed a new, long-term federal highway

and transit authorization

bill

,

Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Infrastructure Act (FAST Act),

into law after the final legislation

received strong, bipartisan support in both the House and the

Senate.

The FAST Act provides multi-year funding to state and local governments in support of road, bridge, intermodal and public transportation projects.

The FAST Act increases Federal-Aid Highway Program funding from $41 billion in the federal fiscal year (FFY)


to $47 billion in FFY 2020.

Federal

spending

for highways

is supported by

$

208 billion

in

excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, taxes on heavy truck sales and use, and heavy truck tire taxes

a

nd by a $70 billion transfer of general funds to the

F

ederal Highway Trust F

und.

The long-term nature of t

he FAST Act

, which authorizes federal funding through FFY 2020

,

is important. T

he Federal-Aid Highway Program is the largest component of the law and has provided, on average, 52% of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10

years.

This multi-year authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-range, complex highway projects.

The FAST Act also contains important policy changes.

To further accelerate the project delivery process, it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act (MAP-21). The new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects

—

particularly freight projects. In states where

we

operate, we are well-positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this FAST Act funding

and policy implementation

.

Project financing remains an

important additional component of overall

surface transportation

spending

, with

the

Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program

authorized at

$275 million

(

in line with the previous program outlays

) and

growing to $300 million by 2020

.

The FAST Act also created a new National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue public-private partnerships and other financing arrangements

for transportation projects

.

§

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE:

The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016 (

WIIN

), which we and numerous other business allies strongly supported, was signed into law in December 2016. This law is the successor to the

Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA).

It reauthorizes needed investment in America’s ports, channels, locks, dams, and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system and provides flood protection for communities. It also provides funding to the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (WIFIA), which was

modeled after the highly popular TIFIA program in the surface transportation sector.

Created in WRRDA 2014, WIFIA will allow for federal credit assistance to water resources projects

in the form of low-cost loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit

.

Part I


Private sector

CONSTRUCTION

The private sector

construction

market

s i

nclude both nonresidential building

construction

and residential construction and

are

considerably

more cyclical than public construction. In 201


, privately-funded construction accounted

for

approximately


%

of our

total aggregates shipments.

§

Nonresidential Construction:

Private nonresidential

building

construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction

.

Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally

is

driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals,

places of worship

and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

This end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

Nonresidential construction is expected to continue to be a stable source of volume growth in


based on the following assumptions: (1) continuing employment growth should provide support, as it has in the past, (2) current backlogs that our customers

,

industry groups

and outside economists

are reporting should continue to be a source of demand in


,

a

nd (3) growing state and local tax revenues should provide local governments with the funds to make capital investments in schools and other public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

§

Residential Construction:

The majority of residential construction is for single-family hous

ing

with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in

our m

arkets

continue to outpace household formations in

the

rest of the

U

nited

S

tates

.

Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage

financing

and builders’ ability to maintain skilled labor

.

U.S.

housing starts, as measured by

Dodge Analytics

data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than

0.6 million

units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.

In 2016, total

annual

housing starts

in the U.S. increased to 1.


million (an increase of 2.2% over 2015). Housing growth was particularly robust in our markets, which grew at almost twice the rate of the nation as a whole

.

The

consistent

growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS

We sell

aggregates that are used as

balla

st fo

r construction and maintenance of railroad track

s

. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along

roads and

waterways.

In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use

limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a

fine powder can be sold as

agricultural lime.

We

sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "

Segment Reporting

"

in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

vertical integration

While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns. We produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Southwestern and Western markets. Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 80% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In both of these downstream businesses, aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations.

Part I



. ASPHALT MIX

We produce and sell asphalt mix

in

Arizona, California,

New Mexico

and Texas

. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately

95%

by weight

of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt

M

ix segment

primarily

through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery

typically is within close proximity

to the producing facility.

The asphalt

mix

production process requires liquid asphalt

cement

, which we purchas

e fr

om third-party producers.

We do not anticipate any

significant

difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

We serve our Asphalt

M

ix segment customers from our local production facilities.


.

CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete

in

Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia, Washington D.C. and the Bahamas. In May 2015, we entered the Arizona ready-mixed concrete market

through the acquisition of

ready-mixed concrete operations in

conjunction with the acquisition of aggregates operations in

Arizona and New Mexico. In January 2015, we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona.

In March 2014, we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area. For additional details see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 80% by weight of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment primarily through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for

the particular grade and quality of material required.

We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility.

Ready-

mixed concrete production also requires cement

which w

e purchase

from

third-

party

producers

. We do not anticipate any

significant

difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

OTHER BUSINESS

-

RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all

of

our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart

er. Fu

rthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions

, demographic and population fluctuations,

and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.

Part I


COMPETITORS

We operate in a

generally fragmented

industr

y w

ith a large number of small, privately-held companies.

We estimate that the ten largest aggrega

tes producers account

ed

for approximately


% to


%

of to

tal U.S. aggregates production

in 201


. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than


%.

O

ther publicly

traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

§

Cemex

S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH

plc

§

Heidelberg

Cement AG

§

Lafarge

Holcim

§

Martin Marietta Materials

, Inc.

§

MDU Resources

Group, Inc.

§

Summit Materials

, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with

over

6,000

companies managing

more than 11,000

operations

during 201


, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by

acquiring existing facilities to

enter new markets

or extend

their

existing

market positions.

CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business

depends

upon any

single

customer whose loss would have

a significant

adverse effect on our business. In 201


, ou

r f

ive

largest

customers accounted

for

8.


%

of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than

3.0

%

of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately


% to


%

of our

aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to

numerous

federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the

environment and

worker

health and saf

ety;

examples include

regulation of

facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both

Mine Safety and Health Administration (

MSHA

)

and

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (

OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs.

We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201


and 201


will be approximately

$


million and $


million, respectively

. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have

a

material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available

about

the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

For additional information

about

litigation and environmental matters, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Part I


Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information

about

reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents,

registered

trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.

ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

﻿

The following risks could materially and adversely affect

our business

,

financial condition

and

results of operations

,

and

cause

the trading price of our common stock

to

decline

.

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

EC

ONOMIC/POLITICAL

RISKS

Changes

in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental

, international trade

and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures

—

Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use

,

environmental

, and international trade

matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations

are subject to environmental, zoning and land use requirements and

require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capit

al an

d operating

expenditures to comply with

the applicable requirements.

Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities

, taxes or tariffs

on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede

our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities.

Our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure

—

Our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal, state and local governments.

Although

Congre

ss p

assed

and President Obama signed

a five-year, fully

-

funded bill

into law

to invest in roads, bridges and public transportation

in 2015, and

in 2016, three state legislatures in Vulcan

-served

areas passed one-time revenue increases for transportation

and b

allot measures

were also

passed

to increase investment transportation infrastructure

in several

Vulcan-served

areas including northern and southern California, Georgia, North Carolina and Sout

h Carolina

,

given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects.

Climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business —

A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a "cap and trade" system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions.

Other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts, such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity.

The impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate chang

e l

egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position,

results of operations or

cash flows.

We

are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business

—

We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA).

W

e face

political and

other risks associated with

our

international operations

, including our largest production facility located in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. These risks

may include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes or government royaltie

s or overt acts by foreign governments.

In addition, f

ailure to comply with the FCPA may result in legal claims against us.

Part I


GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs

—

The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are

significantly

vertically integrate

d.

Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices

and

lower sales volum

es in

some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash

flows.

The expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations

—

Recycled concrete and asphalt mix are increasingly being used in a number of our markets, particularly urban markets, as a substitute for aggregates. The

expanded

use of recycled concrete and asphalt mix could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates.

Our

long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our

future

earnings

—

Constru

ct

ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the

products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry si

tes often take years to develop

;

therefore

,

our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.

Our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings

—

The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results w

ill depend i

n part on our ability

to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.

FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS

Our

industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in

product shipments

—

Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates,

our profit

s a

re

negatively affected by

significant

decreases in

shipments

.

Significant downturn

in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill

—

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair

value

of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have

not

identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 20



tha

t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value,

a significant downturn

in the construction industry may have a

material

effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of

goodwill.

Part I


A deterioration in our credit ratings and/or the state of the capital markets could negatively impact our business

—

We currently have $2 billion of debt with maturities between 2018 and 2037. Given our current credit metrics and ratings, together with other factors, we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when

due. Furthermore

, we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations, additional debt and/or additional equity. The mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situational dependent.

A deterioration in our credit ratings, regardless of the cause, could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing (whether for refinancing existing debt or financing acquisitions). While we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade, and plan to manage the capital structure consistent with investment

-

grade credit metrics, we cannot assure our current credit ratings.

A deterioration in the state of the capital markets, regardless of our credit rating, could impact our access to, and cost of, new debt or equity capital.

We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results

—

As discussed more fully in "Critical Accounting Policies" under Item


"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," we use significant

judgment in accounting for

:

§

g

oodwill impairment

§

impairment of long-

lived assets excluding goodwi

ll

§

p

ension and other postretirement benefits

§

environmental

compliance

§

claims and liti

gation including self-insurance

§

income

taxes

These

assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and

could adversely affect our financial position

, results of operations, or cash flows.

PERSONNEL RISKS

Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations

—

A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics

of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit

packages.

OTHER

RISKS

We are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks

—

Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of our systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage

, which could adversely affect our results of

operations, as

a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect

our

business. Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations.

Weather can materially affect our operating results

—

Almost all of our products are

consumed outdoors

in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ short-term demand because their work also can be hampered

by weather.

Part I


Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings

—

Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets.

The c

osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability

—

In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors

that

interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in several

complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemical

s b

usines

s

. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of

operations or cash flows. For a description

of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12

"

Commitments and Contingencies

"

in

Item 8

"

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

We are involved in certain

environmental

matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or

disposal. As

required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

AGGREGATES

A

s t

he largest U.S.

supplier

of construction aggregates, we have operating facilities across the U.S. and in Mexico and the

Bahamas. We principally serve mark

ets in


sta

tes,

Washington D.C.

and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the U.S. that are expected

to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates.

﻿

﻿

Our current estimate of

15.5

billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve

s

reflects

a

de

crease of

0.2

billion tons from

the prior year’s

estimate

.

Estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers, recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and subject to permit or other restrictions.

Proven, or measured, reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data, together with other direct and measurable observations

,

such as outcrops, trenches and quarry faces. The grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling, and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. Probable, or indicated, reserves are those reserves for which

quantity, grade

and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable, though not drilled, geologic evidence. The degree

of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation

.

Part I


Reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease, and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained. Leases, zoning, permits, reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas, depths and lengths of time allowed for mining, stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place, and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities, berms, and overburden or

waste storage, among other requirements and restrictions. Our reserve estimates take into account these factors. Technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis. For example, excessive overburden or weathered rock, rock quality issues, excessive mining depths, groundwater issues, overlying wetlands, endangered species habitats, and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable. In addition, computations for reserves in-place are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste.

The

15.5

billion tons of estimated

proven and probable

aggregates reserves reported at the end of



i

OUR FIVE CORE DISCIPLINES

﻿

1. SALES AND MARKETING EXCELLENCE

Goal:

Remain the market supplier of choice in order to increase our market share while earning full and fair value for our products and services.

Execution:

We are winning more than our fair share of large project bids by leveraging our scale and extensive strong customer relationships.

2. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

Goal:

Run

the

industry’s

safest and most efficient operations by successfully leveraging and driving cost efficiencies to achieve 60% flow through of incremental aggregates

freight-adjusted

revenue

s

.

Execution:

We are driving our cost of revenues down by leveraging our purchasing power and multi-modal logistic

s

network and by better managing inventory levels.

In

2016 and

2015, we exceeded our long-term flow through goal of 60% by achieving


% and


%

, respectively,

flow through of incremental aggregates

freight-adjusted

revenue

s

.

3.

S

ELLING

,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL

(SAG) PRODUCTIVITY

Goal:

Continue to leverage SAG in order to achieve 6% of

total

revenues.

Execution:

We are leveraging our recentl

y i

mplemented common ERP platform

an

d r

eorganized central shared services to reduc

e a

dministrative

expenses

and enable rapid integration of acquired operations. As a result, SAG as a percentage of

total

revenues has decreased from

9.1

% in


to

8.8

% in 2016.

4. CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY

Goal:

Drive improvement in capital turnover while maintaining the longer term health of our asset base.

Execution:

We are improving capital turnover by maximizing the lifecycle value of land holdings and optimizing working capital and inventory levels.

5. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Goal:

Continue to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions and selectively enter new markets that meet our growth profile while divesting non-core businesses.

Execution:

In 2016, we

expanded our

aggregates distribution capabilities

in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas.

In 2015, we completed a swap of twelve ready-mixed concrete plants in California for thirteen asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. We also acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete plants in Arizona and New Mexico.

OUR COMMITMENTS

We crush rocks for a living, but at its core, this is a relationship business. We are deeply committed to our customers and our people, and deeply embedded in our communities.

Our commitment to customers

— We have the capabilities to fulfill our customers’ needs on large, complex jobs with unmatched performance and service and we

aim to be

the supplier of choice for smaller contractors. With all of our customers, we strive to maintain and improve our relationships, to provide outstanding value and service for a fair price by being a solution provider rather than simply an aggregates provider.

Our commitment to our employees

— We work hard to ensure our employees’ safety and health, in a positive environment where each person can thrive. We are completely focused on the things that we can control, and it is here that our people continue to make all the difference: increasing unit profitability, delivering incremental earnings and improving our world-class aggregates franchise every day.

Our commitment to our communities

— Our people contribute to the cities, towns and neighborhoods where they live and work, in big ways and in small; from disaster relief to the support of education and a wide variety of other social causes and programs. At Vulcan, this means a great deal more than just financial support. Our people throughout the United States, and in Mexico, are generously volunteering their time, talent and energy to improve the world around them.

Our commitment to the environment

— We take a long-term approach that bears in mind the demands of the present and the needs of the future. As we continue to build on our legacy, we do so with a clear view of our responsibility to future generations.

Our commitment to our shareholders

— We work hard every day to generate returns that exceed market averages. We are good stewards, with responsible operating and capital project expenditures, to achieve a healthy return on our shareholders’ investment in us. We will continue to strive to be the market leader, winning on margin performance, consistent strength of execution and pricing performance; earning a superior return on the very significant capital invested in our business.

We believe our ability to succeed stems directly from these commitments. Over the years, nearly six decades, we have built a strong, resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way. We expect this to continue for the decades to come.



ACQUISITIONS

Part I

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

The strong fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business and the outstanding improvement in our core profitability have led to strong earnings growth during the last three years of recovery. In 2017, we expect continued growth across the vast majority of our markets and across each of the end use segments we serve. Our expectation for full year Adjusted EBITDA of $1.125 to $1.225 billion is driven by a continuing recovery in shipments, with higher levels of publicly funded construction activity just beginning to join the ongoing recovery in private demand, as well as a favorable pricing environment.

The following assumptions support our outlook for strong year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA in 2017:

§

Aggregates shipments growth of 5

% to

8% from 2016, wit

h g

rowth weighted more toward the second half of the year

§

Freight-adjusted aggregates price increase of 5

% to

7%, with unit margins continuing to grow faster than pricing

§

Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium segment gross profit growth of approximately 15%

§

SAG expenses of approximately $320 million, 2% higher than the prior year and excluding business development-related expenses

Other expectations include:

§

Core capital spending of approximately $300 million to support the increased level of shipments and further improve production costs and operating efficiencies

§

Interest expense of approximately $140 million

§

Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense of approximately $300 million

§

Effective tax rate of 28%

We remain focused on continuous

, compounding

improvement

in profitability and cash flows

.

Our 2017 outlook reflects earnings growth and unit margin performance consistent with recent trends as well as our longer range goals.

The flow-through of freight-adjusted revenues to gross profit in our Aggregates segment should remain in line with the long-term goal of greater than 60%.

Since the beginning of this recovery, o

ur eff

orts have resulted in Aggregates segment gross profit increasing $515 million on a 41 million ton increase in shipments. During this

same

period, uni

t g

ross profit in our core Aggregates segment has improved

89%

on a trailing twelve month

basis

SAME-STORE

We have provided certain information on a same-store basis. When discussing our financial results in comparison to prior periods, we

may

exclude the operating results of recently acquired/divested businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed. These recently acquired/divested businesses are disclosed in Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” This approach allows us to evaluate the performance of our operations on a comparable basis. We believe that measuring performance on a same-store basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our operations are performing period over period without the effects of acquisition and divestiture activity. Our same-store information may not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities.

ear-over-year changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below:

OPERATING RESULTS BY SEGMENT

We present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level. We have four

operating (and

§

increased 11% in 2014

For the year, shipments rose 2% over the prior year, with this gain coming despite double-digit shipment declines in California, Illinois and Texas. Trailing twelve month construction start activity, both public and private, has steadily improved since July 2016. This improvement has helped reverse year-over-year declines from May to October, which negatively impacted our shipments in the second half of the year. The backlog of construction projects in development continues to grow as well. In addition, state and local governments continue to pass measures to increase public infrastructure investme

nt.

We routinely arrange the delivery of our aggregates to the customer. Additionally, we incur transportation costs to move aggregates from the production site to remote distribution sites. These costs are passed on to our customers in the aggregates price. We remove these pass-through freight and transportation revenues (and any other

aggregates-derived

revenues, such as landfill tipping fees) from the freight-adjusted selling price for aggregates. See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this Item 7 for a reconciliation of freight-adjusted revenues.

﻿

Pricing increased 7%, with virtually all of our markets realizing higher pricing versus the prior year. The overall pricing climate remains favorable as visibility to a sustained recovery improves and as construction materials producers stay focused on earning adequate returns on capital.

Asphalt Mix segment gross profit increased 25% to $97.7 million. Volumes and price decreased 3% and 2%, respectively, versus the prior year while gross profit margin expanded 4.3 percentage points (430 basis points) due mostly to lower unit costs for liquid asphalt.

The significant increase in asphalt mix shipments from 2014 to 2015 was largely attributable to the January 2015 swap of our concrete operations in California for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona.

INCOME TAXES

Our income tax

expense

from continuing operations for

the

years ended December 31 is shown below:

﻿

﻿

The $30.0 million increase in our 2016 income tax expense is primarily related to the year-over-year improvement in our earnings from continuing operations partially offset by

a $24.8 million excess tax benefit from share-based compensation resulting from our early

adoption of ASU 2016-09

(see Note 1 “Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”

under the caption

S

hare-based Compensatio

n

)

. The 2016 reduction in the effective tax rate is due to higher benefits from the statutory depletion deduction related to higher aggregates sales and the early adoption of ASU 2016-09.

The $3.3 million increase in our 2015 incom

e t

ax

e

xpense

is primarily related to the year-over-year improvement in our earnings from continuing operations

. The 2015 reduction in the effective tax rate is due to higher benefits from the statutory depletion deduction and the U.S. production deduction, both related to higher aggregates sales.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Our

primary

sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial, committed bank line of credit. Additional

sources of capital

include access to the capital markets, the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate, and dispositions of no

§

potential share repurchases

Our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged from the prior year. We intend to take a balanced approach to capital deployment, one incorporating strategic reinvestment, sustained financial strength and flexibility, and the return of capital to shareholders. In

2016 and

2015, we returned

$

106.3

through share repurchases. We expect to increase the return of capital through dividends

, share repurchases

, or other mechanisms, as earnings grow.

We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:

§

maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing

capacity

§

proactively

manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low

§

maintain an appropriate balance of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt

Net cash provided by operating activities was $644.6 million during 2016, a $125.1 million increase compared to 2015.

VERSUS 201

and share repurchases

(1,427 thousand shares compared to 228 thousand shares)

. Additionally, there were no proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in 2016 (compared to $73.0 million in 2015) as only stock-only stock appreciation rights (SOSARs) remained outstanding at the beginning of the year. Finally, the aforementioned

early

Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 was $

014. This large decrease is primarily attributable to

2014’s

$506.4 million principal amount debt purchase, which required $579.7 million of cash. The 2014 debt purchase was funded by the aforementioned sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area. In

The total cash requirement for these actions was $702.3 million ($635.1 million principal, $59.3 million of premiums above par and transaction fees of $7.9 million). We funded the refinancing by issuing $400.0 million of new 10-year notes, borrowing $235.0 million under our new and expanded line of credit and using $67.3 million of cash. Furthermore,

The term loan may be funded in up to three draws through June


, 2017, after which any undrawn amount expires. Borrowings bear interest in the same manner as the line of credit. Until June

actions resulted

in total debt of approximately $

2.0

billion as of December 31, 2015 (consistent with year-end 2014) and have the following benefits, among others: (1) eliminate

$621.1 million of debt maturities in 2015 – 2018, (2) extend

ed

the weighted-average life of our debt portfolio, and (3) lower

ed

our weighted-average interest rate.

The 2015 refinancing actions resulted in charges totaling $67.1 million. Such charges are detailed in Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and are presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1

"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

"

in Item 8

"

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.

We believe the

following

six

critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

1.

Goodwi

ll im

pairment

2.

Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

3.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

4.

Environmental compliance

costs

5.

Claims and litigation including self-insurance

1. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is

less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 201


, goodwill represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgment.

HOW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have identified


reporting units, of which


carry goodwill. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. We elected to perform

the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

STEP 1

We compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill

:

§

if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired

§

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any

STEP 2

We compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair valu

e representing implied goodwill:

§

if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

Part I

I


HOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE

First, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. Then, we estimate the fair values of the reporting uni

ts

using bo

th an income approach

(

which involves discounting estimated future cash flows

)

and a market

approach

(

which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies

)

.

W

e consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models

. Finally, to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization.

OUR FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS

We base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our

control, o

r u

nderperformance relative to historical or projecte

d o

perating results. These conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.

RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS

The results of our annual impairment tests for:

§

November 1, 201


indicated that the fair values of

all reporting units with goodwill

substantially

exceeded

(

in excess of


%

values

2. IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of December 31, 201


,

net

p

roperty, plant & equipment

represents


% of total assets, while

net

other intangible assets

represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates

, assumptions and judgment. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

Fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

Part I

I


We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impai

rment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g.

,

a

sphalt mix and

ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates)

impacts

the profitability of the downstream business.

During 2016, we

recorded a $10.5

million

loss on

impairment of long-lived assets

resulting from the termination of a nonstrategic aggregates lease and the write off of nonrecoverable project costs related to two Aggregates segment capital projects that we no longer intend to complete

.

During 2015, we recorded a $

5.2

millio

n i

mpairment

loss

resulting from exiting a lease.

During 201


, we recorded a $

3.1

million

impairment

loss

related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area, see Note 19 "Acquisitions and Divestitures" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

We maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being

use

d in our operations. These assets

totaled $

374.4

million at December 31, 201


, representing

a less than 1.0

%

in

crease from December 31, 201


. Of the total

$

374.4

million

,

approximately


%

relates

to re

al estate held for future development and expansion of o

ur op

erations.

In

addition

, approximately


%

is comprised of real estate (principally former mining sites) pending development as commercial or residential real estate, reservoirs or landfills. The remaining


%

is composed of aggregates,

a

sphalt mix and

r

eady-mix

ed concrete

operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products. We anticipate moving

idled assets back into operation as demand recovers. We evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions

about

the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Each year we review

the following primary

assumption

s:

§

DISCOUNT RATE

— The discount rate used in calculating the present value of

projected

benefit paymen

and the discount rates used to measure service cost and interest cost

§

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

future return on plan assets reduce

s

the recorded net benefit costs

§

RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE

§

after 2015

will

no

t i

ncrease ou

r po

stretirement medical benefits

obligation

as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level

HOW WE SET OUR ASSUMPTIONS

In selecting the discount rate, we

use

the yield on high-quality bonds with a duration equal to

the duration of plan liabilitie

s. A

t December 31, 201


, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from

3.43

% to

4.41

%

(December 31, 201


ranged from

3.53

% to

4.68

%).

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 201


, the expected return on plan assets

was reduced to 7.00% (December 31, 2015 was 7.50%)

.

Part I

Changes

to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligation

I

n 2016, we chang

ed

our

method to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Previously

, we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.

As of 2016

, we elected to

use

a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cos

t, a

pplying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows.

We ma

de

this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding yield curve spot rates

.

We account

ed

for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, account

ed

for it prospectively

as of

2016. The weighted-average discount rates

used

to measure servic

e a

nd interest cos

ts

for 2016

were

4.68

% and

3.79

%, respectively, for our pension plans and

3.77

% and

2.81

%, respectively, for

our other postretirement

plans.

We do

not

anticipate contributions

to

the funded pension pla

ns

will be required during 201


; however,

we do anticipate making a discretionary contribution

of $9.5 million

. We currently do

not

anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.

pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 "Benefit Plans" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

COSTS

Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs.

Our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

COSTS

To account for environmental

costs

, we:

§

expense or capitalize environmental

costs consistent

with our capitalization policy

§

expense

costs

for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues

§

accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost

At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur

, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study

. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount.

If

no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 201


, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $

3.3

millio

n

—

this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis.

Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates

and

key assumptions

in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. H

owever,

a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings an

d u

nanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information

about

environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 "Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."


. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program

. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $

2.0

million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $

3.0

million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention

levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.

Our accounting policy for claims and litigation including self-insurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.

HOW WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS

We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

For additional information

about

claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"

. INCOME TAXES

VALUATION OF OUR

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

We fil

e f

ederal, state and foreign income tax returns

and a

ccount for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met

hod.

We

recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities

(

which reflect our best assessment of th

e f

uture taxes we will pay

)

based on the differences between the

book basis and tax basis

of assets and liabilities

. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns

while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns.

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred

tax assets is included in Note 9 “Income Taxes” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

At December 31, 201


, we have state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of $

54.5

million, against which we have a valuation allowance of $

44.2

million. Of the deferred tax assets, $

53.2

million relates to Alabama.

From 2008 through the second quarter of 2015, we carried a full valuation allowance against the Alabama deferred tax asset for the following reasons:

§

we had a substantial cumulative loss in Alabama

§

due to our legal entity structure, we had no expectation of creating

sufficient

taxable income in Alabama

During the second quarter of 2015, we restructured our legal entities. Among other benefits, we anticipated that the restructuring would generate significant taxable income in Alabama, and therefore, allow for the utilization of some or all of the Alabama deferred tax asset.

Our Alabama cumulative loss is calculated as pretax earnings from continuing operations, discontinued operations and other comprehensive income plus permanent differences over the last three years. While evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, realizing the significance of the restructuring in our Alabama income tax filing, we determined that it was appropriate to adjust our Alabama cumulative loss calculation to consider the restructuring, remove pretax earnings from discontinued operations and other comprehensive income and remove any other significant nonrecurring items. We refer to this calculation as our Alabama adjusted earnings.

At the end of the second quarter

of 2015

, our Alabama adjusted earnings were negative. However, the Alabama adjusted earnings loss was dramatically smaller t

han our Alabama cumulative loss

(o

f the three adjustments made, the restructuring had the greatest impact

)

. In addition, we considered all other forms of positive and negative evidence, including the four sources of taxable income. The first three sources of taxable income (carryback potential, reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies) provided very little positive evidence. Because our Alabama adjusted earnings were a loss, we did not project future Alabama taxable income (the fourth source). As a result, during the second quarter

of 2015

we continued to carry a full valuation allowance against our Alabama deferred tax asset.

At the end of the third quarter

of 2015

, our Alabama adjusted earnings turned positive. This development

provided sufficient positive evidence such that we determined it was appropriate

to

use

projections of future Alabama taxable income

in our assessment

for the first time. However, because we had not yet returned to sustained profitability (i.e.,

an

Alabama

cumulative gain

) we used our Alabama

trailing twelve months

adjusted earnings as the basis for an objectively verifiable projection of future Alabama taxable income. This projection, in addition to considering all other positive and negative evidence, led us to conclude in the thir

d qu

art

er th

at it was more likely than not that $

4.7

million of the deferred tax asset was realizable. Therefore, we recognized

a deferred

tax benefi

t

of $4.7 millio

n i

n the third quarter

of 2015

by reducing the valuation allowance

. Ou

r a

nalysis

in each of the four subsequent quarters

further confirmed our third quarter

of 2015

conclusio

n b

ut

resulted in no further

reductions

of the valuation allowance

.

Part I

I


In the fourth quarter of 2016, we achieved three consecutive years of

positive

Alabama adjusted earnings.

This development together with the projection of future Alabama taxable income (using our most recent trailing twelve months adjusted earnings)

warranted an additional partial releas

e of

$4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As of year-end 2016, we

have recognized

$9.5 million of the Alabama deferred tax asset.

We believe that once we have an Alabama cumulative gain, we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that we have returned to sustained profitability and we will no longer limit our estimate of future taxable income to our Alabama trailing twelve months adjusted earnings. At that time, we

may

realize a significant portion, if not all, of the Alabama deferred tax asset. We project the earliest this could happen would be the fourth quarter of 2017.

L

IABILITY FOR

UNRECOGNIZ

ED TA

X BENEFITS

We recognize

a ta

x benefit associated with

a t

ax position when

we judge

it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained

based upon the technical merits of the position

. For a tax position that meets the

more likely than not

recognition threshold, w

e m

easure th

e

income

t

ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realiz

ed.

A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position.

Ou

r liability

for

u

nrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments a

nd new or emerging

legislation.

The

years open

to

tax

examinations

vary

by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is

appropriate

.

We

consider a

tax position

to

be resolved

at the earlier of

the issue being “effectively settled,”

settlement of an examination

,

or

the expiration of the statute of limitati

ons. Upon resolution

of a tax position, an

y

liability for

u

nrecognized tax benefits will be

released.

Ou

r liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties

associated with our

liability for

unrecogniz

income tax expense.

ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

﻿

MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business.

To

manage these market risks, we may

use

derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

As discussed in the Liquidity and Financial Resources section of

Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"

we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and

r

isk

of financial stress

. Such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense. In addition to floating-rate borrowings under our line of credit, we at times

use

i

nterest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed-

rate

and floating-rate debt.

While floating-rate debt exposes us to rising interest rates, it is typically cheaper than issuing fixed-rate debt at any point in

time but can become more expensive than previously issued fixed-rate debt. However, a rising interest rate environment is not necessarily harmful to our financial results. Since 2002, our EBITDA and Operating income are

positively

correlated to floating interest rates (as measured by 3-month LIBOR). As such, our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates, and floating-rate debt serves as a natural hedge against weaker operating results

due to general economic weakness

.

At December 31, 201


, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt including current maturities was $

2,243.4

million compared to a book value of $

1,982.9

million. The estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt. The fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date. The effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by

approximately

$

104.9

million.

We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high-quality bonds and the expected return on plan assets. The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Annual Report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

﻿

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To t

he Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vulcan Materials Company an

d subsidiaries

(the "Company") as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for

each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 201


. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to

express an opinion on the

se

financial statement

s b

ased on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of

the three years in the period ended December 31, 201


in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


, based on

the

criteria established in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Vulcan Materials Company (the "Company," "Vulcan," "we," "our"), a

New Jersey

corporation, i

s t

he nation's largest

supplier

of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

We serve markets in

twenty

states, Washington D.C., and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states in metropolitan markets in the United States that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These

three

demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates. While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Southwestern and Western markets.

Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as described in Note 2, the results of the Chemicals business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vulcan Materials Company and all our majority or

wholly-owned subsidiary companies. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of these financial statements are related to goodwill and long-lived asset impairment

s, p

ension and other postretirement benefits, environmental compliance, claims and litigation including self-insurance, and income taxes.

BUSINESS COMBINA

TIO

NS

We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and

assumptions.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

The U.

S

. dollar is the functional currency for all of our operations. For our non-U.S. subsidiaries, local currency inventories and long-term assets such as property, plant & equipment and intangibles are remeasured into U.S. dollars at approximate rates prevailing when acquired; all other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Inventories charged to cost of sales and depreciation are remeasured at historical rates; all other income and expense items are remeasured at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Gains and losses which result from remeasurement are included in earnings and are not material for the years presented.

Part I

I


CASH EQUIVALENTS

We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.

RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash consists of cash proceeds from the sale of property held in escrow for the acquisition of replacement property under like-kind exchange agreements. The escrow accounts are administered by an intermediary. Pursuant to the like-kind exchange agreements, the cash remains restricted for a maximum of 180 days from the date of the property sale pending the acquisition of replacement property. Changes in restricted cash balances are reflected as an investment activity in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our extending credit to trade customers for the purchase of our products. The terms generally provide for payment within 30 days of being invoiced. On occasion, when necessary to conform to regional industry practices, we sell product under extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or unsecured short-term notes; or, on occasion, notes with durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing accounts receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from short-term transactions (less than one year) other than the sale of our products, such as interest receivable; insurance claims; freight claims; tax refund claims; bid deposits or

rents receivable. Receivables are aged and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense are recorded. Bad debt expense (income) for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 2016

—

$(1,190,000)

,


—

$1,450,000

and


—

$2,031,000

. Write-offs of accounts receivables for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 2016

—

$1,544,000

,


—

$1,483,000

and


—

$2,561,000

.

The bad debt income in 2016 relates to the collection of previously reserved receivables primarily attributable to the 2014 sale of our Florida area concrete and cement businesses.

INVENTORIES

Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories because it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials, direct labor and production overhead. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. Substantially all operating supplies inventory is carried at average cost. For additional information

about

our inventories see Note 3.

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT

Property, plant & equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. The cost of properties held under capital leases, if any, is equal to the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease.

Capitalized software costs of

$4,732,000

and

$7,003,000

are reflected in net property, plant & equipment as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We capitalized software costs for the years ended December 31 as follows: 2016 —

$152,000

, 2015 —

$1,482,000

and 2014 —

$921,000

.

For additional information

about

our property, plant & equipment see Note 4.

REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments that add materially to the utility or useful lives of property, plant & equipment are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance activities, related primarily to periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to the next overhaul.

Part I

I


DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION, ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated service lives of the various classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (


to


years), buildings (


to


years) and land improvements (


to


years). Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis beginning when the software project is substantially complete.

Cost depletion on depletable land is computed by the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units.

Accretion reflects the period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset retirement obligations. It is computed using the same credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to initially measure the liability at fair value.

Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful lives.

Amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets.

A significant portion of our intangible assets is contractual rights in place associated with zoning, permitting and other rights to access and extract aggregates reserves. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31 is outlined below:

﻿

﻿

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We periodically use derivative instruments to manage our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt and to manage our exposure to currency exchange risk or price fluctuations on commodity energy sources consistent with our risk management policies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Additional disclosures

about

our derivative instruments are presented in Note 5.

Part I

I


FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2:

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data

Level 3:

Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement

Our assets at December 31 subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below:

﻿

﻿

﻿

We hav

e t

wo

Rabbi Trusts for the purpose of providing a level of security for the employee nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans and for the directors' nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds and equity securities for which quoted prices in active markets are available. Level 2 investments are stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying investments in the fund (short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit).

Net gains (losses) of the Rabbi Trust

investments were

$2,741,000

,

$(1,517,000)

and

$1,169,000

for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The portions of the net gains (losses) related to investments still held by the Rabbi Trusts at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were

$1,599,000

,

$(1,769,000)

The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, short-term debt, trade payables and accruals, and all other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

Assets subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis in 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:

﻿

Part I

We recorded

$10,506,000

and

$5,190,000

of losses on impairment of long-lived assets in 2016 and 2015, respectively, reducing the carrying value of these Aggregates segment assets to their estimated fair values of

$0

and

$0

. Fair value was estimated using a market approach (observed transactions involving comparable assets in similar locations).

G

OODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2016, goodwill totaled

$3,094,824,


, the same as

at

December 31, 2015. Goodwill represents

37%

of total assets at December 31, 2016

, the same as at

December 31, 2015.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium. Within these

four

operating segments, we have identified


reporting units (of which


carry goodwill) based primarily on geographic location. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

The first step of the quantitative impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step of the quantitative impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

The results of the first step of the annual impairment tests performed as of November 1, 20


, 2015 and 2014 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values. Accordingly, there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 20


, 2015 or 2014.

We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies). Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

For additional information

about

goodwill see Note 18.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

Part I

I


We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g., asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.

As of December 31, 2016, net property, plant & equipment represents

39%

of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents

9%

of total assets. During 2016, we recorded a

$10,506,000

loss on impairment of long-lived assets

resulting from the termination of a nonstrategic aggregates lease and the write off of nonrecoverable project costs related to two Aggregates segment capital projects that we no longer intend to complete

. During 2015, we recorded a

$5,190,000

impairment

loss

related to exiting a lease for an aggregates site. During 2014, we recorded a

$3,095,000

i

mpairment

loss

related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area (see Note 19).

For additional information

about

long-lived assets and intangible assets see Notes 4 and 18.

TOTAL REVENUES AND REVENUE RECOGNITION

Total revenues include sales of product to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers. Freight and delivery generally represents pass-through transportation we incur (including our administrative costs) and pay to third-party carriers to deliver our products to customers. The cost related to freight and delivery is included in cost of revenues.

Revenue is recognized at the time the selling price is fixed, the product's title is transferred to the buyer and collectibility of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured (typically occurs when finished products are shipped to the customer).

SALES TAXES

Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded as liabilities (within other current liabilities) until remitted to taxing authorities and therefore, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

DEFERRED REVENUE

In 2013 and 2012, we sold a percentage interest in future production structured as volumetric production payments (VPPs).

The VPPs:

§

relate to

eight

quarries in Georgia and South Carolina

§

provide the purchaser solely with a nonoperating percentage interest in the subject quarries’ future production from aggregates reserves

§

are both time and volume limited

§

contain no minimum annual or cumulative production or sales volume, nor minimum sales price

Our consolidated total revenues excludes the sales of aggregates owned by the VPP purchaser.

We received net cash proceeds from the sale of the VPPs of

$153,282,000

and

$73,644,000

for the 2013 and 2012 transactions, respectively. These proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and are amortized to revenue on a unit-of-sales basis over the terms of the VPPs (expected to be approximately


years, limited by volume rather than time).

Part I

Reconciliation of the deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent) is as follows:

Based on

expected s

ales from the specified quarries, we

expect to recognize approximately

$8,080,000

as income

n 2


(reflected in other current liabilities in our 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet).

STRIPPING COSTS

In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits are referred to as stripping costs.

Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered costs of extracted minerals under our inventory costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. The production stage is deemed to begin when the activities, including removal of overburden and waste material that may contain incidental saleable material, required to access the saleable product are complete. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced were

$55,987,000

in 2016,

$50,409,000

in 2015 and

$44,896,000

in 2014.

Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are excluded from our inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized and reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are expensed over the productive life of the mine using the unit-of-production method. Pre-production stripping costs included in other noncurrent assets were

$70,227,000

as of December 31, 2016 and

$61,369,000

as of December 31, 2015. This year-over-year

inc

rease resulted primarily

from the removal of overburden at a greenfield site in California.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We account for share-based compensation awards using fair-value-based measurement methods. These result in the recognition of compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards (less an estimate for forfeited awards) based on their fair value as of the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period.

A summary of the estimated future compensation cost (unrecognized compensation expense) as of December 31, 2016 related to share-based awards granted to employees under our long-term incentive plans is presented below:

EARLY ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-09  W

e receive an income tax deduction for share-based compensation equal to the excess of the market value of our common stock on the date of exercise or issuance over the exercise price.

Upon our early adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, t

ax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) are

reflected as discrete income tax benefits in the period of exercise or issuance.

Before the adoption of this standard, excess tax benefits were recorded directly to equity (APIC).

Net e

xcess tax benefits of

$24,847,000

are reflected as a reduction to our income tax expense for 2016 (see Note 9)

.

Gross excess tax benefits of

$28,009,000

are classified as operating cas

h f

lows prospectively beginning in 2016 while gross excess tax benefits for 2015 and 2014 of

$18,376,000

and

$3,464,000

, respectively, are reflected as financing cash flows. Upon the adoption of this ASU, we revised our dilutive share calculation to exclude the

assumption that

proceeds from excess tax benefits

would be used to purchase shares,

resulting in an increase in dilutive shares as of December 31, 2016 of

773,101

.

ASU 2016-09 requires that the cash paid for shares withheld to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. As a result, we revised our accompanying Statements of Cash Flows for prior years to conform to the 2016 presentation as follows:


— increased operating cash flows

$16,160,000

with a corresponding decrease in financing cash flows, and


— increased operating cash flows

$671,000

with a corresponding decrease in financing cash

flows.

share-based compensation, see Note 11 under the caption Share-based Compensation Plans.

RECLAMATION COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost (

including a reasonable profit margin)

for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation

tasks. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

The carrying value of these obligations was

$223,872,000

as of December 31, 2016 and

$226,594,000

as of December 31, 2015. For additional information

about

reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations) see Note 17.

Part I

I


PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions

about

the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The primary assumptions are as follows:

§

Discount Rate

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of projected benefit payments

§

Expected Return on Plan Assets

— The expected future return on plan assets reduces the recorded net benefit costs

§

Rate of Compensation Increase

— Annual pay increases after 2015 will not increase our pension plan obligations as a result of a 2013 plan amendment

§

Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Healthcare Benefits

— Increases in the per capita cost after 2015 will not increase our postretirement medical benefits obligation as a result of a 2012 plan amend

ment

Accounting standards provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and asset performance. The differences between actual results and expected or estimated results are recognized in full in

other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in a systematic

manner over the average remaining service period of participants for our active plans or the average remaining lifetime of participants for our inactive plans.

For additional information

about

pension and other postretirement benefits see Note 10.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our environmental compliance costs are undiscounted and include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. We accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study.

When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount.

If

no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2016, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was

$3,341,000

—

this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers.

Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates

and

key assumptions

in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. H

owever,

a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information

about

environmental compliance costs see Note 8.

Part I

I


CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to

$2,000,000

per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to

$3,000,000

per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. The following table outlines our self-insurance program at December 31:

﻿

﻿

The increase in liabilities and the offsetting increase in receivables as noted above relate

primarily

to a former Chemicals business

litigation matter

as discussed in Note 12.

Estimated payments (undiscounted

and excluding the impact of related receivables

) under our self-insurance program for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2016 are as follows:

﻿

﻿

Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

INCOME TAXES

We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities (which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay) based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns.

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

Part I

I


Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9.

U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. At least annually, we evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore.

We recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than

50%

likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.

The years open to tax examinations vary by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate.

We consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled,” settlement of an examination, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Upon resolution of a tax position, any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

Our largest permanent item in computing both our taxable income and effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

We report comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Equity. Comprehensive income comprises two subsets: net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI includes fair value adjustments to cash flow hedges, actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs related to pension and postretirement benefit plans.

For additional information

about

comprehensive income see Note 14.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)

Earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution (diluted EPS), as set forth below:

﻿

﻿

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our earnings per share calculations. Antidilutive common stock equivalents are not included in our earnings per share calculations.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation.

During 2016, we early adopted ASU 2016-09, “Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” resulting in adjustments to our prior financial statements as noted in the caption

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

As of December 31, 2016, we early adopted

Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

2016-09, “Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which amends several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. Most significant

ly, t

he income tax effects of awards

are recognized

in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled

(t

he use of APIC pools

is

eliminated). Additionally, the guidance requires cash paid for shares withheld (to satisfy the employer’s statutory income tax withholding obligation) to be presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.

See the caption

S

hare-based Compensatio

n

above for the impact of the adoption of this standard to our consolidated financial statements.

GOING CONCERN

As of December 31, 2016, we adopted

ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concer

n w

ithin one year after the date that the financial statements are issued

. T

he adoption of this standard

did not

have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

and related notes

.

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE INVESTMENTS  During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted

ASU

2015-07, “Disclosures for Investment in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).” This ASU removed the requirement to categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy when their fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. This ASU also removed the requirement to make certain disclosures for investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which

we

elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The impact of this standard

was

limited to our annual pension plan fair value disclosures

(see Note 10) and was applied retrospectively

.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION

INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS  In October 2016, the

Financial Accounting Standards Board

(FASB) issued ASU 2016-16, “Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,” which requires the tax effects of intercompany transactions other than inventory to be recognized currently. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after

December 15, 2017,

and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

C

ASH FLOW CLASSIFICATION  In August 2016, the

FASB

issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which amends guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU adds or clarifies guidance on eight specific cash flow issues.

Additionally, guidance on the presentation of restricted cash is addressed in ASU 2016-18 which was issued in November 2016. Both of these standards are

effective for annual reporting periods beginning after

December 15, 2017,

and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted

.

We do not expect the adoption of

these

standard

s

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Part I

I


CREDIT LOSSES  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which amends guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The new guidance estimates credit losses based on expected losses, modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after

December 15, 2019

, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. While we are still evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-


, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement

s.

LEASE ACCOUNTING  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” which amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting and adds additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement and presentation of cash flow in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted and modified retrospective application is required. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which amends certain aspects of current guidance on the recognition, measurement and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other changes, this ASU requires most equity investments be measured at fair value. Additionally, the ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for instruments not recognized at fair value in our financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

INVENTORY MEASUREMENT  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market principle to the lower of cost and net realizable value principle. The guidance applies to inventories that are measured using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost method, but does not apply to inventories that are measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory method. We use the LIFO method for approximately

66%

of our inventory (based on the December 31, 2016 balances); therefore, this ASU will not apply to the majority of our inventory. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 201

7. W

e do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This ASU provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues and expands required revenue recognition disclosures. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers: Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net),” which amends the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014-09. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 provide guidance on recording revenue on a gross basis versus a net basis based on the determination of whether an entity is a principal or an agent when another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer. These ASUs are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Further, in applying these ASUs an entity is permitted to use either the full retrospective or cumulative effect transition approach.

While w

e are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of

these

standard

s

on our consolidated financial statements

, we expect to identify similar performance obligations under ASU 2014-09 compared with the deliverables and separate units of account we have identified under existing accounting standards. As a result, we expect the timing of our revenues to remain generally the same. We will adopt these standards using the cumulative effect transition approac

NOTE 2: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation.

NOTE 5: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to balance the cost and risk of such expenses. We do not

use

derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.

The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationship. The interest rate swap agreements described below were designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap fair value hedges are recorded as interest expense consistent with the change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged.

Part I

I


CASH FLOW HEDGES

During 2007, we entered into

fifteen

forward starting interest rate locks on

$1,500,000,000

of future debt issuances

to

hedge the risk of higher interest rates. Upon the 2007 and 2008 issuances of the related fixed-rate debt, underlying interest rates were lower than the rate locks and we terminated and settled these forward starting locks for cash pay

ments of

$89,777,000

. This amount was booked to AOCI and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.

This amortization was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 as follows:

﻿

﻿

The loss

es

reclassified from AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred loss in the amount of

$

7,208,000

and

$3,762,000

, respectively, referable to the debt purchases as described in Note 6.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 201


, we estimate that

$

2,179,000

of the pretax loss in AOCI will be reclassified to earnings.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

In June 2011, we issued

$500,000,000

of

6.50%

fixed-rate notes due in 2016 to refinance near term floating-rate debt. Concurrently, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of

$500,000,000

to reestablish the pre-refinancing mix of fixed-

rate

and floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month London Interbank Offered

Rate (LIBOR) plus a

spread of

4.05%

and received a fixed interest rate of

6.50%

. Additionally, in June 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our

$150,000,000

of

10.125%

fixed-rate notes due in 2015. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of

8.03%

and received a fixed interest rate of

10.125%

. In August 2011, we terminated and settled these interest rate swap agreements for

$25,382,000

of cash proceeds. The

resulting

gai

n w

as added to the carrying

value of the related debt and wa

s amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the related debt using the effective interest method.

This deferred gain amortization was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 as follows:

﻿

﻿

T

he deferred gain was fully amortized in December 2015, concurrent with the retirement of the

10.125%

notes due 2015.

The amortized deferred gain

s

for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred gain in the amount of

Borrowings on the bank line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay within twelve months and as long-term debt otherwise.


The effective interest rate is the spread over LIBOR as of the

debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest method over th

e terms of the respective notes resulting in

$4,418,000

of net interest expense for these items for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The estimated fair value of our debt presented in the table above was determined by: (1) averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and (2) assuming par value for the remainder of the debt. The fair value estimates for the publicly traded notes were based on Level 2 information (as defined in Note 1, caption Fair Value Measurements) as of their respective balance sheet dates.

Borrowings on our line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay within twelve months and as long-term debt if we have the intent and ability to extend repayment beyond twelve months. Borrowings bear interest, at our option, at either LIBOR plus a credit margin ranging from

1.00%

to

In December 2016, we entered

into

an unsecured

$250,000,000

year, typically renew automatically, and can only be modified or cancelled with the approval of the beneficiary. All of our standby letters of credit are issued by banks that participate in our $750,000,000 line of credit, and reduce the borrowing capacity thereunder.

A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

As noted above, we have state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of $

54,498,000

of which

$53,220,000

relates to Alabama.

The Alabama net operating loss carryforward, if not

We are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. We anticipate no single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date.

We file income tax returns in U.S. federal, various state and foreign jurisdictions. Generally, we are not subject to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years

NOTE 10: BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor

three

qualified

, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees hired

before

July 2007, other than those covered by union-administered plans. Normal retirement age is


, but the plans contain provisions for earlier retirement. Benefits for the Salaried Plan and the Chemicals Hourly Plan are generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the Construction Materials Hourly Plan provides benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of service. In addition to these qualified plans, we sponsor

three

unfunded, nonqualified pension plans. The projected benefit obligation presented in the table below includes

$85,021,000

and

$89,652,000

related to these unfunded, nonqualified pension plans for 201


and 201


, respectively.

Effective July 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans to no longer accept new participants. In December 2013, we amended our defined benefit pension plans so that future

benefit

accruals for salaried pension participants ceased effective December 31, 201


.

espectively.

Our expected return on plan assets is: (1) a long-term view based on our current asset allocation, and (2) a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary.

The expected return on plan assets used to determine

2016 pension benefit cost was

7.50%

.

We establish our pension investment policy by evaluating asset/liability studies periodically performed by our consultants. These studies estimate trade-offs between expected returns on our investments and the variability in anticipated cash contributions to fund our pension liabilities. Our policy balances the variability in potential pension fund contributions to expected returns on our investments.

Our current strategy for implementing this policy is to invest in publicly traded equities and in publicly traded debt and private, nonliquid opportunities, such as venture capital, commodities, buyout funds and mezzanine debt. The target allocation ranges for plan assets are as follows: equity securities —

50%

to

77%

; debt securities —

15%

to

27%

; specialty investments —

0%

to

20%

; commodities —

0%

to

6%;

and cash reserves —

0%

to

5%

. Equity securities include domestic investments and foreign equities in the Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Emerging Market Indices. Debt securities primarily include domestic debt instruments, while specialty investments include investments in venture capital, buyout funds, mezzanine debt, private partnerships and an interest in a commodity index fund.

The fair values

and net asset values

of our pension plan assets at December 31, 201


and 201


by asset category are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2016

﻿

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2015

﻿

﻿

﻿


See Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements for a description of the fair value hierarchy.


As discussed in Note 1, we adopted ASU 2015-07 as of March 31, 2016. As a result, pension plan assets measured using the net asset value practical expedient were excluded from the fair value hierarchy.

﻿

Part I

I


At

each measurement date, we estimate the fair value

s and net asset values

of our pension assets using various valuation techniques. We

use

, to the extent available, quoted market prices in active markets or observable market inputs in estimating the fair value of our pension assets. When quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not available, we

use

valuation techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of our pension assets. The following describes the types of investments included in each asset category listed in the tables above and the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair values

or net asset values

as of December 31, 201


and 201


.

The debt securities category consists of bonds issued by U.S. federal, state and local governments, corporate debt securities, fixed income obligations issued by foreign governments, and asset-backed securities. The fair values of U.S. government and corporate debt securities are based on current market rates and credit spreads for debt securities with similar maturities. The fair values of debt securities issued by foreign governments are based on prices obtained from broker/dealers and international indices. The fair values of asset-backed securities are priced using prepayment speed and spread inputs that are sourced from the new issue market.

Investment funds consist of exchange traded and non-exchange traded funds. The commodity funds asset category consists of a single open-end commodity mutual fund. The equity f

unds asset category consists of

a publicly

traded mutual fund investing in

domestic

equities. For

investment funds publicly traded on a national securities exchange, the fair value is based on quoted market prices. For investment funds not traded on an exchange, the total fair value of the underlying securities is used to determine the net asset value for each unit of the fund held by the pension fund. The estimated fair values of the underlying securities are generally valued based on quoted market prices. For securities without quoted market prices, other observable market inputs are

use

d to determine the fair value.

Common/collective trust fund investments consist of index funds for domestic equities

,

an actively managed fund for international equities

, and a short-term investment fund for highly liquid, short-term debt securities

. Investments are valued at the net asset value

(NAV)

of units of a bank collective trust. The

NAV

is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The

NAV

is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less its liabilities. This practical expedient is not used when it is determined to be probable that the fund will sell the investment for an amount different than the reported

NAV

.

The

venture capital and partnerships asset category consists of various limited partnership funds, mezzanine debt funds and leveraged buyout funds.

NAV

is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value.

The

NAV

of these investments has been estimated based on methods employed by the general partners, including consideration of, among other things, reference to third-party transactions, valuations of comparable companies operating within the same or similar industry, the current economic and competitive environment, creditworthiness of the corporate issuer, as well as market prices for instruments with similar maturities, terms, conditions and quality ratings. The use of different assumptions, applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value of these securities.

We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements for union-represented employees. A multiemployer plan is subject to collective bargaining for employees of two or more unrelated companies. Multiemployer plans are managed by boards of trustees on which management and labor have equal representation. However, in most cases, management is not directly represented. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans differ from single employer plans as follows:

§

assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers

§

if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers

§

if we cease to have an obligation to contribute to one or more of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability

None

of the multiemployer pension plans that we participate in are individually significant. Our contributions to individual multiemployer pension funds did not exceed

5%

of the fund’s total contributions in the three years ended December 31, 20


, 201


and 201


. Total contributions to multiemployer pension plans were

$10,435,000

in 201


,

$9,800,000

in 201


and

$8,503,000

in 201


.

As of December 31, 201


, a total of

12.8%

of our domestic hourly labor force was covered by collective-bargaining agreements. Of such employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements,

8.5%

were covered by agreements that expire in 201


. We also employed


union employees in Mexico who are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement that will expire in 20


.

None

of our union employees in Mexico participate in multiemployer pension plans.

In addition to the pension plans noted above, we had

one

unfunded supplemental retirement plan as of December 31, 201


and 201


. The accrued costs for the supplemental retirement plan were

$1,320,000

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In 2012, we amended our postretirement healthcare plan to cap our portion of the medical coverage cost at the 2015 level. Substantially all our salaried employees and, where applicable, certain of our hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying age and meet certain service requirements. Generally, Company-provided healthcare benefits

end

when covered individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach age


, whichever occurs first.

The March 2014 sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area (see Note 19) significantly reduced total expected future service of our postretirement plans resulting in a reduction in the projected benefit obligation of

$2,639,000

and a one-time curtailment gain of

$3,832,000

. This gain is reflected within gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses in our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ASSUMPTIONS

Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the

expected return on plan assets,

and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

Annual pay increases after 2015

do

not increase our pension plan obligations as a result of a 2013 plan amendment.

In selecting the discount rate, we consider the yield on high-quality bonds with a duration equal to the duration of plan liabilities. At December 31, 201


, the discount rates

used to measure the benefit obligation for

our various plans ranged from

3.43%

to

4.41%

(December 31, 201


ranged from

3.53%

to

4.68%)

.

I

n 2016, we chang

ed

our

method to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Previously

, we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.

As of

2016, we elected to

use

a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost

,

applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows.

We

m

a

de

this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding yield curve spot rates

.

We accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it prospectively as of 2016. The weighted-average discount rates used to measure service cost and interest cost for 2016 were

4.68%

and

3.79%

, respectively, for our pension plans and

3.77%

and

2.81%

, respectively, for our other postretirement

plans.

Part I

I


Our expected return on plan assets is: (1) a long-term view based on our current asset allocation, and (2) a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary.

In

estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 201


, the expected return on plan assets

was reduced to

7.00%

(December 31, 2015 was

7.50%

)

.

Future increases in the per capital cost of healthcare benefits will not increase our postretirement medical benefits obligation as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level.

DE

﻿

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity period approximating the SOSARs expected term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts adjusted for current expectations of future payouts. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility and expectations about future volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the SOSARs expected term. The expected term is based on historical experience and expectations about future exercises and represents the period of time that SOSARs granted are expected to be outstanding.

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.

Part I

I


We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as potential obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While ultimate resolution and financial liability is uncertain at a number of the sites, in our opinion based on information currently available, the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to these sites will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for that period. Amounts accrued for environmental matters are presented in Note 8.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine with precision the outcome, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.

In addition to these lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, certain other material legal proceedings are specifically described below.

§

Lower Passaic River Study Area (Superfund Site)

— The Lower Passaic River Study Area is part of the Diamond Shamrock Superfund Site in New Jersey. Vulcan and approximately 70 other companies are parties (collectively the Cooperating Parties Group) to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (draft RI/FS) of the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River (River). However, before the draft RI/FS was issued in final form, the EPA issued a record of decision (ROD) in March 2016 that calls for a bank-to-bank dredging remedy for the lower 8 miles of the River. The EPA estimates that the cost of implementing this proposal is $1.38 billion. In September 2016, the EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with Occidental Chemical Corporation (Occidental) in which Occidental agreed to undertake the remedial design for this bank-to-bank dredging remedy, and to reimburse the United States for certain response costs.

Efforts to remediate the River have been underway for many years and have involved hundreds of entities that have had operations on or near the River at some point during the past several decades.

We

formerly owned a chemicals operation near the mouth of the River, which was sold in 1974. The major risk drivers in the River have been identified as dioxins, PCBs, DDx and mercury.

We

did not manufacture any of these risk drivers

and

have

no evidence that any of these were discharged into the River by Vulcan

.

T

he AOC does not obligate us to fund or perform the remedial action contemplated by either the draft RI/FS or the

ROD

.

Furthermore, the

parties who will participate in funding the remediation a

nd their respective allocation

s h

ave

not

been determined.

We

d

o n

ot agree that a bank-to-bank remedy is warranted, and

we are

not obligated to fund any of the remedial action at this time; nevertheless, we previously estimated the cost to be incurred by us as a potential participant in a bank-to-bank dredging remedy and recorded an immaterial loss for this matter in 2015

.

§

TEXAS BRINE MATTER — During the operation of its former Chemicals Division, Vulcan was the lessee to a salt lease from 1976 – 2005 in an underground salt dome formation in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. The Texas Brine Company (Texas Brine) operated this salt mine for

our

account.

We

sold

our

Chemicals Division in 2005 and assigned the lease to the purchase

r a

nd

we have

had

no association with the leased premises or Texas Brine since that time. In August 2012, a sinkhole developed near the salt dome and numerous lawsuits were filed in state court in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Other lawsuits, including class action litigation, were also filed in August 2012 in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans.

Part I

I


There are numerous defendants to the litigation in state and federal court. Vulcan was first brought into the litigation as a third-party defendant in August 2013 by Texas Brine.

We have

since been added as a direct and third-party defendant by other parties, including a direct claim by the state of Louisiana. The damages alleged in the litigation range from individual plaintiffs’ claims for property damage, to the state of Louisiana’s claim for response costs, to claims for physical damages to oil pipelines, to business interruption claims. In addition to the plaintiffs’ claims,

we have

also been sued for contractual indemnity and comparative fault by both Texas Brine and Occidental. The total amount of damages claimed is in excess of

$500

million. It is alleged that the sinkhole was caused, in whole or in part, by

our

negligent actions or failure to act. It is also alleged that

we

breached the salt lease, as well as an operating agreement and a drilling agreement with Texas Brine; that

we are

strictly liable for certain property damages in

our

capacity as a former assignee of the salt lease; and that

we

violated certain covenants and conditions in the agreement under which

we

sold

our

Chemicals Division in 2005.

We have

made claims for contractual indemnity, comparative fault, and breach of contract against Texas Brine, as well as claims for contractual indemnity and comparative fault against Occidental. Discovery is ongoing and

no trials are currently set

.

In December 2016,

we

settled with the plaintiffs in one of these cases

involving property damages

but there are cross-claims remaining against

us

in that case.

In February 2017, we offered to settle with the plaintiffs in the cases involving physical damages to oil pipelines.

The insurer

s

who ha

ve

coverage at

the

se

settlement

amount

s

agreed that the case

s

were

covered

by our

policy. An

immaterial loss limited to our insurance deductible was recognized during the fourth quarter.

Except for

these

case

s

, a

t this tim

e w

e cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability pertaining to this matter.

§

HEWITT LANDFILL MATTER

(SUPERFUND SITE)

—

In

September 2015, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) issued a Cleanup and Abatement Order (CAO) directing Vulcan to assess, monitor, cleanup and abate wastes that have been discharged to soil, soil vapor, and/or groundwater at

the

former Hewitt Landfill in Los Angeles. The CAO follows a 2014 Investigative Order from

the

RWQCB that sought data and a technical evaluation regarding the Hewitt Landfill, and a subsequent amendment to the Investigative Order requiring Vulcan to provide groundwater monitoring results to

the

RWQCB and to create and implement a work plan for further investigation of the Hewitt Landfill.

In April 201


,

we

submitted an interim remedial action plan (IRAP) to the RWQCB, proposing a pilot test of a pump and treat system; testing and implementation of a leachate recovery system; and storm water capture and conveyance improvements.

We are

currently implementing the IRAP, including the drilling and installation of monitoring wells and construction of a treatment plant for a pilot-scale groundwater extraction and re-injection treatment system.

The estimated cost to implement the IRAP is fully accrued.

Operation of the

pilot-sca

le treatment system began in January 2017.

However, u

ntil this pilot

testing is

complete, we are unable to estimate the cost of remedial action.

We are

also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the

EPA

, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and other stakeholders regarding the potential contribution of the Hewitt Landfill to groundwater contamination in the

North Hollywood Operable Unit (NHOU) of the

San Fernando Valley

Superfund Site

. We are gathering and analyzing data and developing technical information to determine the extent of possible contribution by the Hewitt Landfill to the groundwater contamination in the area. This work is also intended to assist in identification of other

PRPs that may have contributed to groundwater contamination in the area

.

In July 2016, the EPA sent a letter to

us

requesting that

we

enter into an AOC for remedial design work at the NHOU including, but not limited to, the design of two or more groundwater extraction wells to be located south of the Hewitt Landfill.

In February


, the EPA sent a draft AOC to us.

Vulcan and EPA representatives expect to engage in negotiations for a possible AOC during the first

and second

quarter

s

of 2017.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and a number of factors, including developments in ongoing discovery or adverse rulings, or the verdict of a particular jury, could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued costs. No liability was recorded for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be only reasonably possible or for which a loss could not be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in defense of lawsuits are expensed as incurred. In addition, losses on certain claims and litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a per occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described in Note 1 under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.

NOTE 15: SEGMENT REPORTING

We have

four

operating (and

reportable

) segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium.

The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel, sand, and other aggregates) and related products and services (transportation and other). During 201


, the Aggregates segment principally served markets in

twenty

states, Washington D.C. and Mexico with a full line of aggregates, and

two

additional states with railroad ballast. Customers use aggregates primarily in the construction and maintenance of highways, streets and other public works and in the construction of housing and commercial, industrial and other nonresidential facilities. Customers are served by truck, rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities and sales yards. Due to the high weight-to-value ratio of aggregates, markets generally are local in nature. Quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be available.

The Asphalt Mix segment produces and sells asphalt mix in

four

states primarily in our southwestern and western markets.

The Concrete segment produces and sells ready-mixed concrete in

six

states, Washington D.C. and an immaterial amount in the Bahamas. In January 2015, we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California (see Note 19) for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona. In March 2014, we sold our concrete business in the Florida area (see Note 19) which in addition to ready-mixed concrete, included concrete block, precast concrete, as well as building materials purchased for resale.

The Calcium segment consists of a Florida facility that mines, produces and sells calcium products.

Before

the sale of our cement business in March 2014 (see Note 19), we produced and sold Portland and masonry cement in both bulk and bags from our Florida cement plant and imported and exported cement, clinker and slag and either resold, ground, blended, bagged or reprocessed those materials from other Florida facilities.

Aggregates comprise approximately

95%

of asphalt mix by weight and

80%

of ready-mixed concrete by weight. Our Asphalt Mix and Concrete segments are primarily supplied with their aggregates requirements from our Aggregates segment. These intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of product

use

d in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Customers for our Asphalt Mix and Concrete segments are generally served locally at our production facilities or by truck. Because asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete harden rapidly, delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately


to


miles from the producing facility.

The vast majority of our activities are domestic.

We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the United States.

Total domestic revenues were

$

3,579,427,000

in 2016,

$3,410,773,000

in 2015 and

$2,979,470,000

NOTE 16: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Supplemental information referable to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is summarized below:

﻿

﻿

NOTE 17: ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets.

Recognition of a liability for an ARO is required in the period in which it is incurred at its estimated fair value. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. If the ARO

is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement.

We record all AROs for which we have legal obligations for land reclamation at estimated fair value. Essentially all these AROs relate to our underlying land parcels, including both owned properties and mineral leases. For the years ended December 31, we recognized ARO operating costs related to accretion of the liabilities and depreciation of the assets as follows:

﻿

﻿

ARO operating costs are reported in cost of revenues. AROs are reported within other noncurrent liabilities in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 18: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Acquired identifiable intangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) goodwill, (2) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization and (3) intangible assets with indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually. For additional information

about

our policies on impairment reviews, see Note 1 under the captions Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment, and Impairment of Long-lived Assets excluding Goodwill.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is recognized when the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. There were

no

charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 20


, 201


and 201


.

We have four reportable segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


and 201


are summarized below:

﻿

﻿

We

test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. A decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of goodwill.

Part I

I


INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are stated at their fair value determined as of the date of acquisition. Costs incurred to renew or extend the life of existing intangible assets are capitalized. These capitalized renewal/extension costs were immaterial for the years presented. Intangible assets consist of contractual rights in place (primarily permitting and zoning rights), noncompetition agreements, favorable lease agreements, customer relationships and trade names and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired individually or otherwise obtained outside a business combination consist primarily of permitting, permitting compliance and zoning rights and are stated at their historical cost less accumulated amortization.

See Note 19 for the details of the intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions during


, 201


and 201


. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As shown in Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements, we incurred

$8,180,000

and

$2,858,000

of impairment charges related to intangible assets in

2016 and


, respectively

. There were

no

charges for impairment of intangible assets in


14.

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major intangible asset class for the years ended December 31 are summarized below:

MANAGEMENT

'S REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Under management's supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework (


)

issued by

the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 201


.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


. Deloitte & Touche LLP's report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, follows this report.

LIMITATIONS OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM – INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To t

he Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vulcan Materials Company an

d subsidiaries

(the "Company") as of December 31, 201


based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated

Framework (


)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the

effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective

internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding

of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of

the

effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


based on the criteria

established in
