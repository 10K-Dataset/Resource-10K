VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION

We are

t

he

largest producer of construction aggregates

in the country with

coast-to-coast

aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:

§

a

favorable geographic footprint that provides attractive long-term growth prospects

§

the

largest proven and probable reserve base

in the United

States

T

hese factors allow us to provide attractive unit profitability through our strong operating expertise and price discipline.

STRATEGY FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS

§

Our

aggregates

reserves are strategically located throughout the United States i

n a

reas

that are projected to grow faster than the national average and

that require large amounts of aggregates to meet

construction

demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate


% of the total growth in U.S. population and



% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2010 and 2020.

§

We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow

more

rapidly and

by

divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 201

4, we

divested our Florida cement and concrete businesses for cash proceeds of $


21.4

million and

entered into

a twenty

-

year

aggregates

supply agreement

to provide aggregates

to the divested concrete operations. We redeployed $


31.8

million of this capital through acquisitions that added over




million tons of proven and probable

aggregates

reserves in key growth markets in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.C.

§

W

here practical, we have operations located

close to our local markets because the cost of trucking

materials long distances is prohibitive.

Approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively

from the producing location to the customer

by truck, and another


%

are delivered by truck after reaching a

sales

yard by rail or water

.

The remaining


% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

COMPETITORS

We operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies.

We estimate that the ten largest aggrega

tes producers account

ed

for approximately


% to


%

of to

tal U.S. aggregates production

in 201


. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than


%.

O

ther publicly

traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

Cemex

S.A.B. de C.V.

§

Heidelberg

Cement AG

§

Holcim

Ltd.

§

Lafarge

§

Martin Marietta Materials

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with

over

5,000

companies managing

over

10,000

operations

during 201


, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by

acquiring existing facilities to

enter new markets or

by

extending

their

existing

market positions.

Part I


BUSINESS STRATEGY

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to

maintain and

expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in

most

types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and a

irports that connect us, and to

build the hospitals, churches,

schools,

shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our lives and the

economy.

Our

business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4)

managing volume, product

mix

and price to grow profitability

, and 5) effective land management.

1.

AGGREGATES FOCUS

Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio

n a

nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist. Our focus on aggregates allows

us to

:

§

BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES

:

T

he location

of

our

reserves

are

critical to

our

long-term success

b

ecause of barriers to

entry created in

many metropolitan

markets by zoning and permitting regulations and hig

h c

osts

associated with transporting aggregates

. Our reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that will require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. Aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities an

d, other than energy inputs required to process the materials,

require

virtually

no

other

raw materi

al. O

ur downstream businesses (asphalt mix and concrete

) u

se Vulcan-produced aggregates

almost exclusively

.

§

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER

:

Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular

geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce

saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan

is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by

shipments

or by

aggregates

revenues.

The


ag

gregates

facilities

we operated during 201


provide

d

opportunities to standardize

operating practices

and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in

an

efficient and cost-effective manner

,

both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service,

accounting,

accounts receivable and accounts payable, technical support and engineering.

2.

C

OAST-TO-COAST

FOOTPRINT

Demand for construction aggregates

correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly.

In 201


, we

expanded our operational footprint i

n Arizona, California, Texa

s,

V

irginia

and Washington D.C.

, and accessed new markets in New Mexico through acquisitions. These acquisitions, totaling $


31.8

million

of investment, added more than




million tons of proven and probable

aggregates

reserves serving markets where reserves are relatively scarce.

PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our

long-term

growth is a result of

strategic

acquisition

s a

nd

investments in key operations

.

§

Strat

egic

acquisitions:

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California

and

Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt

mix. In

2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and

our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in

other southeastern and

m

id-Atlantic

states

. In 2014, we completed eight transactions that expanded our aggregates

business in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.

C.

In addition to these large acquisitions, we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth.

te ma

ny opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects that will add reserves, increase production capacity and improve

costs.

Part I


4.

MANAGING VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICE TO GROW PROFITABILITY

We commonly think of three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination

.

§

Price for Service

—

We seek to receive full and fair value for the quality of products and service we provide. We should be paid appropriately for helping our customers be successful.

§

Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

W

e

focus on

rigorous cost management throughout

the

economic cycl

e. Sm

all savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions.

§

Sales and Production Mix

—

W

e a

djust

production levels to meet

varying

market

conditions

. Managing inventories responsibly results in

improved cost performance and

an improved

return on capital

.

We manage these factors locally, and align

o

u

r

talent and incentives accordingly.

Our knowledgeable and

experienced

workforce and our flexible production capabilitie

s a

llo

w

us to manage

operational and overhead

costs aggressive

ly

.

As a result of these cost controls coupled with a disciplined approach to pricing

,

since 2012,

ou

r

Aggregates segment’s

g

ross profit

has

increased 55% on volume improvement of 15%.

While Aggregates

segment

gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past couple of years, we have not yet fully realized

our maximum unit profitability.

§

On

Price for Service

—

Our

expanding margins have

yet to

benefit

from the

mid-to-high single digit price gains associated with cyclical recoveries

. We believe that these gains will begin to take hold in 2015.

§

On

Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

We are operating a capital-intensive business at 50-60% capacity and are extremely well positioned to further leverage fixed costs to sales as we move forward.

§

On

Sales and Production Mix

—

As the recovery continues and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity in the

end

-

use

mix, we will sell the entire production mix much more efficiently and at fuller value.

5.

EFFECTIVE

LA

ND MANAGEMENT

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning

because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue t

o fo

cus our actions on

prudent

decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future.

Part I


PRODUCT LINES

We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines:

1.

Aggregates

2.

Asphalt Mix

3.

Concrete

4.

Calcium (formerly

Cement

)

1. AGGREGATES

A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our busines

s, i

ncluding markets,

the location and quality of

reserves and demand cycles.

§

Local markets:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases,

are

produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the material

s, r

endering

them

uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials.

Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets fro

m q

uarries

that have access to long-haul transportation

— shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.

§

Diverse markets

:

Large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public- and private-sector

construction project

s, su

ch as highways, airports, water and sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast.

§

Location and quality of reserves:

We

currently ha

ve

15.8

billion

tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Such growth

depends on

aggregates for construction. Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restriction

s c

urtail expansion in certain areas, but th

ey al

so increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

§

Demand cycles:

Long-term growth in

demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak esta

blishing a new historical

high.

Part I


I

n addition, the following factors influence the aggregates market:

§

Highly fragmented industry:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of

over

5,000

companies that manage

over

10,000

operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for

consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

Relatively stable demand from the public sector

:

Publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable

and less cyclical

than privately funded construction

,

and

generally

requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically

is

more affected by general

economic cycles than

p

ublicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges

), w

hich

tend to

receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

§

Limited product substitution:

T

here are

limited

substitutes for quality aggregates.

R

ecycled concrete

and asphalt have

certain

applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However,

due to technical specifications

many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concre

te,

but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities

.

Moreover,

the amount of

recycled asphalt

included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates

is limited

due

to

specifications

.

§

Widely used in downstream products:

In the production process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses. Two products that use aggregates

as a raw material

are asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise

approximately

95%

of asphalt mix and

78%

of ready-mixed concrete.

§

Flexible production capabilities:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

raw material inputs

largely under our control

:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric

power.

AGGREGATES

MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with

above-average

long-term

expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or

have

access to economical transportation

via rail, barge or ship

to

a particular end market

. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

PUBLIC SECTOR

CONSTRUCTION

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways,

bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and

private sources. In 2014

, publicly funded construction

accounted for

approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments.

§

Public Sector Funding:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal

surface

transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two decades,

a portion of transportation

projects ha

s

been funded through a series of multi-year bills.

Some 40% of transportation projects are federally-funded, with special emphasis given to the largest and most complex projects.

The long-term

nature of such legislation

is

important

because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-

range

, com

plex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This

T

rust

Fund

receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 201


,

approximately


%

of

our aggregates sales by volume

was

used in highway construction projects.

Part I


§

federal highway funding

:

On August 8, 2014,

Congress passed

an extension of

the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act (

MAP-21

)

. The two-year federal highway bill had received strong

bipartisan suppor

t i

n both the House and the Senate, an

d w

as signed into law by the President on July 6, 2012.

The extension of

MAP-2

1 provides

state departments of transportation with

federal highway program authority through May 31, 2015. The extension continues federal support for transportation infrastructure programs at current funding levels,

helping

rebuild America’s aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.

MAP-21

maintained

essentially level f

unding

in

Fiscal Year

s



and 2015

, w

ith approximately $105 billion

for

total

transportation

funding

through Fiscal Year 2014

. It extends the Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through Fiscal Year 2016, adding additional stability to the Federal Highway Program.

Congressional leaders have stated their intention to act in 2015 to replace the extension of MAP-21 with a multi-year authorization that includes revenue stability for federal surface transportation programs.

The extension of MAP-21 maintained the baseline increase to the

Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Funding for this program increase

d

to $1.75 billion over the two-yea

r M

AP-21 period

,

from $122 million per year under the previous multi-year highway bill

known as SAFETEA-LU

. TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10

, creating the potential for $17.5 billion in additional major project funding for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014.

The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates this TIFIA funding support

s

$30 to $50 billion in new construction.

G

iven administrative requirements and other factors,

the TIFIA program began to have a meaningful impact on aggregates shipments in 2014, and should continue to do so into 2015 and beyond.

TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United States, including

large portions of our footpri

nt.

The program provide

s c

redit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure project

s. E

ligible

sponsor

s i

nclude state and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multi-modal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. We are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of TIFIA-funded projects.

M

AP-21

’s

positive framework for future authorizations

was continued in the extension passed this summer. Its

significant reforms,

consolidation

and

simplification of

federal highway programs,

acceleration of

the project delivery process,

and expanded

project financing and

promotion of

public-private partnership opportunities

have paved the way for further progress as Congress works to pass a new multi-year highway bill.

§

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

:

In June 2014, President Obama signed into law the

Water Resources

Reform and

Development Act (WR

R

DA),

providing

legal authority for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to

pursue

hundreds of navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration infrastructure projects along rivers, canals, ports and inland waterways throughout the natio

n. W

e, along with

numerous

business allies, strong

ly

supported WRRDA

for its

importance to the U.S. economy

, t

he pressing need to

upgrade U.S.

harbors, ports and inland waterways

, and for construction projects using our products. T

he

law

address

es

a significant backlog of water infrastructure projects,

focused on

improved

port

dredging, and

streamlines

permitting

to speed up project delivery.

Many of the large southern ports that would benefit from

WRRDA

, as they gear up for expected increases in freight volumes

related to

expansion of the Panama Canal, lie within our footprint.

Additionally,

WRRDA includes

innovative public-private

authorizations and a new

Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (WIFIA),

modeled after the TIFIA program

.

As enacted,

WIFIA is

authorized

to support large projects exceeding $


million that otherwise

would go unaddressed. A

s with TIFIA, it provides funding for up to 49% of a project's estimated cost, involves low interest rates, and includes favorable repayment terms as well as subrogation of the government's interest in order to encourage other investors.

Part I


Private sector

CONSTRUCTION

The private sector

construction

market

s i

nclude both nonresidential building

construction

and residential construction and

are

considerably

more cyclical than public construction. In 201


, privately-funded construction accounted

for

approximately


%

of our

total aggregates shipments.

§

Nonresidential Construction:

Private nonresidential

building

construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction

.

Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally

is

driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

C

ontract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for

aggregates. In



,

total

nonresidential

contract awards, as measured in square feet, increased for the

4th

year in a row.

P

rivate nonresidential contract awards were up approximately


million square feet, or


%.

Office buildings, retail construction and manufacturing facilities

accounted for all of this growt

h. Em

ployment

gro

wth, att

ractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive

continued

growth in construction activity in this end market.

§

Residential Construction:

The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in

our m

arkets

continue to outpace household formations in

the

rest of the

U

nited

S

tates

.

Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage

financing.

U.S.

housing starts, as measured by

Dodge Analytics

data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.

In 2014, total

annual

housing starts

surpassed 1 million

unit

s.

The growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS

We sell

aggregates that are used as

balla

st fo

r construction and maintenance of railroad track

s

. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along

roads and

waterways.

In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use

limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a

fine powder can be sold as

agricultural lime.

We

sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "

. ASPHALT MIX

We produce and sell asphalt mix

in

Arizona, California,

New Mexico

and Texas

. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately

95%

by weight

of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt

M

ix segment

primarily

through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery

typically is within close proximity

to the producing facility.

The asphalt

mix

production process requires liquid asphalt

cement

, which we purchas

e fr

om third-party producers.

We do not anticipate any

significant

difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

We serve our Asphalt

OTHER BUSINESS

-

RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all

of

our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart

er. Fu

rthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by

a number of factors including

changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.

CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business

depends

upon any

single

customer whose loss would have

a significant

adverse effect on our business. In 201


, ou

r f

ive

largest

customers accounted

for

6.4

%

of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than

2.2

%

of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately


% to



%

of our

aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

Part I


ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to

numerous

federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the

environment and

worker

health and saf

ety;

examples include

regulation of

facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both

Mine Safety and Health Administration (

MSHA

)

and

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (

OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs.

We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201


and 201


will be approximately

$

11.0

million and $

10.7

million, respectively

. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have

a

material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment.

The following is a list of our risk factors.

EC

ONOMIC/POLITICAL

RISKS

Changes

in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures

—

Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations

are subject to environmental, zoning and land use requirements and

require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capit

al an

d operating

expenditures to comply with

the applicable requirements.

Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities.

Climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business

—

A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a "cap and trade" system of allowances and credits

or a carbon tax

, among other provisions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The EPA has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule, referred to as the "Tailoring Rule

,

" which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the Federal Clean Air Act.

With the sale of our Newberry cement plant in March 2014, we no longer have a facility subject to either the reporting or permitting rule

, although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this

time.

Other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts

,

such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity.

The impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate chang

e, l

egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position,

results of operations or

cash flows.

GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs

—

The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are

significantly

vertically integrate

d.

Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices

and

lower sales volum

es in

some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash

flows.

Part I


Our

long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our

future

earnings

—

Constru

ct

ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the

products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry si

tes often take years to develop

;

therefore

,

our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.

Our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings

—

The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results w

ill depend i

n part on our ability

to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.

FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS

Our

industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume

—

Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates,

our profits and profit margins are

negatively affected by

significant

decreases in volume.

Significant downturn

in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill

—

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair

value

of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 20



tha

t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value,

a significant downturn

in the construction industry may have a

material

effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of

goodwill.

We

have substantial debt and our credit ratings are non-investment grade

—

O

ur operating cash flow is burdened by substantial annual interest, and in some years, principal payments. Our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payment

s d

epends on our operating and financial performance.

Our

ability to refinance maturing

debt depends on our financial performance and

the state of the capital markets

(particularly for non-investment grade debt)

. Operating and financial performance is, in turn, subject to general economic and business conditions, many of which are

outside of

our control

.

Our debt instruments contain variou

s

covenants, including:

a

ffirmativ

e (

e.g.,

m

aintai

n i

nsurance), negativ

e (

e.g., restrictions on lines of business),

informational (e.g., provide financial statements) and financial (e.g., minimum EBITDA to interest ratio) covenants

. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, the related debt could become due prior to its stated maturity, and our ability to obtain

alternative

or

additional

financing could be

impaired.

Part I


We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results

—

As discussed more fully in "Critical Accounting Policies" under Item


"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," we use significant

judgment in accounting for

:

§

g

oodwill and goodwill impairment

§

impairment of long-

lived assets excluding goodwill

§

reclamation

costs

§

pension and other postretirement benefits

§

environmental

compliance

§

claims and liti

gation including self-insurance

§

income taxes

We believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates; however, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and

could adversely affect our financial position

, results of operations, or cash flows.

PERSONNEL RISKS

Our future success is dependent upon a management team and divisional structure that are new

—

Since January 1, 2014, we have experienced significant changes in our management team as part of the Company’s management succession plan and new divisio

n o

rganizational structure. Our future success depends in large part upon the effective transition of our new management team and the new divisional structure. If there are further changes in management or organizational structure, such changes could be disruptive and could negatively affect our operations, strategic planning and performance.

Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations

—

A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit

packages.

We are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business

—

We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA). Failure to comply with the FCPA may result in legal claims against us. In addition, we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships, which may include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties impressed by foreign governments.

OTHER

RISKS

We are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks

—

Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of our systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an

infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect or business. Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations.

Weather can materially affect our operating results

—

Almost all of our products are

consumed outdoors

in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ short-term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather. Therefore, our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather.

Part I


Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings

—

Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets.

The c

osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability

—

In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors

that

interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in several

complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals

and Metals

business

es

. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of

operations or cash flows. For a description

of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12

"

Commitments and Contingencies

We are involved in certain

environmental

matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or

disposal

.

ITEM 1B

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We have

not

received any written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act of 1934 that remain unresolved.

Part I


ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

AGGREGATES

As the largest U.S. producer of construction aggregates, we have operating facilities across the U.S. and in Mexico and the

Bahamas. We principally serve mark

ets in


sta

tes,

Washington D.C.

and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the U.S. that are expected

to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates.

Our current estimate of

15.8

billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve

s

reflects an increase of

0.8

billion tons from

the prior year’s

estimate

.

Estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers, recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and subject to permit or other restrictions.

Part I


Proven, or measured, reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data, together with other direct and measurable observations

,

such as outcrops, trenches and quarry faces. The grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling, and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. Probable, or indicated, reserves are those reserves for which

quantity

,

grade

and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable, though not drilled, geologic evidence. The degree

of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation

.

Reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease, and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained. Leases, zoning, permits, reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas, depths and lengths of time allowed for mining, stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place, and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities, berms, and overburden or

waste storage, among other requirements and restrictions. Our reserve estimates take into account these factors. Technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis. For example, excessive overburden or weathered rock, rock quality issues, excessive mining depths, groundwater issues, overlying wetlands, endangered species habitats, and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable. In addition, computations for reserves in-place are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste.

The

15.8

a permitted aggregates quarry in Alabama

In the first quarter of 2014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area

to Cementos Argos

(Argos)

for net pretax cash proceeds of $


21.4

million resulting in a pretax gain of $


11.4

million

(net of $16.5 million of disposition related charges)

. We retained all of our Florida aggregates operations, our

former

Cement segment’s calcium operation in Brooksville, Florida and real estate associated with certain former ready-mixed concrete facilities. Under a separate supply agreement, we will continue to provide aggregates to the divested concrete facilities, at market prices, for a period of 20 years.

Given our aggregates focus

ed

strategy, Argos is a better owner of those assets than we were. Our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capital-intensive businesses in our portfolio. We continually challenge ourselves as to whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations

—

this logic supports the Argos divestiture and also underpins

the

smaller transaction we closed in late January 2015

to exchange

our California

ready-mixed concrete operations for 13 asphalt

mix

plants, primarily in Arizona.

We expect to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets due to our operational and strategic focus in the Arizona asphalt market.

For a detailed discussion

of our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

Aggregates demand is in the early stages of recovery

and remains well below normalized levels. The pattern of recovery is increasingly broad-based and, f

or the first time since 2005, demand in each of the four major end markets increased versus the prior year.

We currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with long-term trends.

Construction activity in our markets grew faster than U.S. markets as a whole in 2014, led by growth in private construction. Residential construction activity, measured in housing starts, continues to recover from depressed levels of demand to more normalized levels needed to support demographics. Private nonresidential construction activity continues to benefit from growth in office and commercial as well as large industrial projects along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, where we are well positioned to provide aggregates to an area deprived of naturally occurring sources suitable for construction.

We see demand from private end-uses up 14% to 18% during 2015. Private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued strength in family and multi-family housi

ng

.

Ou

r employment and housing assumptions are consistent with consensus forecasts and reflect that our markets are growing faster than the

rest of the

U

nited

S

tates

.

Part I

I


Public construction continues to realize steady growth due mostly to strong awards for new projects in 2013 and early in 2014 as well as large transportation-related projects funded through the federal government’s TIFIA program. We currently expect these trends in demand in each of the major end markets to continue in 2015.

We

believe

demand from public end-uses

will increase

3% to 5% during 2015.

Construction award momentum remains positive and stable in our markets.

The

S

outh and

W

est continue to see more growth than other areas of the U

nited

S

tates

. State and local tax revenue growth has mirrored the economic recovery. As tax revenues

approach

all time high levels, they will supply the support for

new public

funding.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Likewise, we believe that this presentation is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent pass-through activities. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

this metric

as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is more meaningful to our investors as it exclude

which are p

ass-through activit

ies. It also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services,

such as landfill tipping fees

, that are

derived from

Incremental gross profit as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in freight-adjusted revenues.

GAAP

does not define "free cash flow

free cash flow

should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity

measure

defined by GAAP

. Likewise, cash gross profit

and

EBITDA should not be considered as

alternatives

to earnings measures defined by GAAP

. We present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyse

s a

nd for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions. The investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company's ability to incur and service debt

and to assess the operating performance of a company’s businesses

. We use free cash flow,

cash gross profit,

EBITDA and other such measures to assess

liquidity and

the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company.

Additionally, we adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period.

We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources

Year-over-year changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below:

OPERATING RESULTS BY SEGMENT

We present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level. We have four

operating (and

report

segments organized around our principal product lines: 1) Aggregates,


) Asphalt Mi

Our year-over-year aggregates shipments

ncreased 11

% in 2014

§

increased


% in 2013

§

declined


% in 201


Sales volume momentum improved across most of our 20-state geographic footprint. This growing momentum is driven by strengthening construction activity across all end-use markets and an increasing number of large projects.

On a same-store basis, aggregates shipments increased 15.0 million tons or 10%.

Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and Virginia saw shipment increases in excess of 10% over the prior year on a same-store basis.

This strong broad-based growth is driven by improving private construction activity and our ability to serve growing demand from large-project work in both private and public end-markets.

Residential construction activity continues to be solid across our footprint, led by growth in multi-family housing. While the growth rate nationally for housing starts has slowed, key markets in

California, Florida,

Georgia

and

Texas

continue to post above-average growth rates. Private nonresidential demand in our markets continues to grow faster than in the U.S. as a whole. This is driven by office, commercial and manufacturing projects

—

and by growth in construction activity along the Gulf Coast

where w

e are uniquely positioned

.

In the public sector, shipments for highways has remained solid due to strong contract awards in 2013, increases in state highway funding, a growing number of TIFIA-funded projects in key states, and the extension of MAP-21

(

the federal highway bill

)

We routinely arrange the delivery of our aggregates to the customer. Additionally, we incur transportation costs to move aggregates from the production site to remote distribution sites. These costs are passed on to our customers in the aggregates price. We remove these pass-through freight and transportation revenues (and any other

aggregates-derived

revenues, such as landfill tipping fees) from the freight-adjusted selling price for aggregates. See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this Item 7 for a reconciliation of freight-adjusted revenues.

Our pricing environment continues to improve with the gradual improvement in demand. During 2014, we realized modest price improvements in all but one of our

management reporting units across our

20-state geographic footprint.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities, a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets. Additional

sources of liquidity

include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate, and dispositions of non-strategic operating assets. We believe these

liquidity and

financial resources are sufficient to fund ou

for 2015

, including:

§

cash contractual obligations

§

capital expenditures

§

debt service obligations

§

potential future acquisitions

§

dividend payments

We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:

§

maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing

capacity

§

proactively

manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low

§

minimize

financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility

§

opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable

Net earnings before noncash deductions for DDA&A increased $152.9 million to $484.4 million during 2014. Included in net earnings for 2014 is a pretax gain of $227.9 million (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) from the sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area. Cash received associated with the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities.

are

outlined below:


Reflects borrowings under our line of credit. Borrowings are shown as short-term due to our intent to repay within twelve months.


Reflects only the cost of borrowings; we also pay fees for unused borrowing capacity and standby letters of credit.

Our long-term debt is unsecured and essentially all such debt agreements contain customary investment-grade type covenants that primarily limit the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing the outstanding debt. Our debt may be redeemed prior to maturity at the greater of par value and the make-whole value plus accrued and unpaid interest.

There were

no

material scheduled debt payments during 2014. However, we purchased $506.4 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer in March 2014 as described in

Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

for a secured facility.

Part I

The negative covenants primarily limit our ability to: (1) incur secured debt, (2) make

certain

investments, (3) execute acquisitions and divestitures, and (4) make restricted payments, including dividends. Such limitations currently do not impact our ability to execute our strategic, operating and financial plans, and becom

less restrictive when the line of credit becomes unsecured as described above.

The line of credit contains two financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA that declines over time to 3.5:1 and (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net cash interest expense that increases over time to 3.0:1.

As of December 31, 2014, we were

in

compliance with all of our long-term debt and line of credit covenants.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1

"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

"

in Item 8

"

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.

Part I

I


We believe the

following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

1.

Goodwill and goodwill impairment

2.

Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

3.

Reclamation costs

4.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

5.

Environmental compliance

6.

Claims and litigation including self-insurance

1.

GOODWILL AND

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 201


, goodwill represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management

judgment.

H

OW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill is tested for imp

airment

one level below our operating segments (reporting unit). W

e have identified


reporting units, of which


carry goodwil

l. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

STEP 1

We compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill

:

§

if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired

§

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any

STEP 2

We compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair valu

e representing implied goodwill:

§

if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

HOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE

First, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. Then, we estimate the fair values of the reporting uni

ts

using bo

th an income approach

(

which involves discounting estimated future cash flows

)

and a market

approach

(

which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies

)

.

W

e consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models.

Finally, to access the reasonableness of

the fair values derived from these valuations, we

compare

the implied fair values to our market capitalization.

Part I

I


O

UR ASSUMPTIONS

We base our fair value estimates on

market participant

assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results. These conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.

RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS

The results of our annual impairment tests for:

§

November 1, 2014 indicated

that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially

exceeded

(by

a range of


% to


%

)

their carrying values

§

November 1, 2013 indicated

that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded

(by

a range of 32% to 620%

)

their carrying values

§

November 1, 201


indicated that the fair values of

all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded

a range of 34% to 851%

)

their carrying

values

For

additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 18 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in Item 8 "Financial Statements

a

nd Supplementary Data."

2. IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of December 31, 201


,

net

p

roperty, plant & equipment

represents


% of total assets, while

net

other intangible assets

represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judg

ment. Th

e carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets.

Fair value is

estimated

primarily

by

using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we

test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g.

a

sphalt mix and

ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.

Part I

I


During 201


, we recorded a $

3.1

million loss on impairment of long-lived assets

related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area

, see Note 19 "Acquisitions and Divestitures" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

We recorded no asset impairments during 2013.

During 2012, we recorded a $2.0 million loss on impairment of long-lived assets. This impairment loss

related primarily to

assets classified as held for

sale

.

We maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations. These assets

totaled $

376.4

million at December 31, 201


, representing an approximate


%

in

crease from December 31, 201


. Of the total

$

376.4

million

,

approximately


%

relates

to re

al estate held for future development and expansion of o

ur op

erations.

In

addition

, approximately



%

is comprised of real estate (principally former mining sites) pending development as commercial or residential real estate, reservoirs or landfills. The remaining



%

is composed of aggregates,

a

sphalt mix and

r

eady-mix

ed concrete

operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products. We anticipate moving

idled assets back into operation as demand recovers. We evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Note 4 "Property, Plant & Equipment" and Note 18 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in Item 8 "Financial

Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

3. RECLAMATION COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

Reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates, assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations (

$

226.6

million as of December 31, 2014 and

$

228.2

million as of December 31, 201


).

HOW WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.

W

e evaluat

e c

urrent facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Note 17 "Asset Retirement Obligations" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Part I

I


4. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

§

DISCOUNT RATE

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future

§

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

— We project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs

§

RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE

— For salary-related plans only, we project employees' annual pay increases

through 2015

, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement

§

RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE

BENEFITS

— We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits

HOW WE SET OUR ASSUMPTIONS

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. We also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high-quality bonds. At December 31, 201


, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from

3.50

% to

4.30

%

(December 31, 201


ranged from

3.80

% to

5.15

%).

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 201


, the expected return on plan assets

remained at 7.50

%

.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience and future expectations. At December 31, 201


, our projected weighted-average rate of compensation

increase

was 3.70%, up from 3.50% at December 31, 2013

.

In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 201


, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits

remained at 7.50

% for 201


, decreasing each year until reaching

5.0%

in 20


and remaining level thereafter.

I

ncrease

s

in the per capita cost after 2015 are not expected to increase our obligations related to postretirement medical benefits as a result of

a


plan

amendment

to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level.

Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost. The following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions:

million and $

(

due

to the nearly

0.8 percentage point (

)

drop in discount rates and the adoption of the new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries on October 27, 2014.

We

do not anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 201


and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution.

We currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 "Benefit Plans" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

5. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs.

Our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

COSTS

To account for environmental

costs

, we:

§

expense or capitalize environmental

costs consistent

with our capitalization policy

§

expense

costs

for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues

§

accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost

At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur

, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study

. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 201


, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $

3.0

million.

Our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis.

Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates

and

key assumptions

in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. H

owever,

a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings an

d u

nanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 "Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

6. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program

. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $

2.0

million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $

3.0

million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention

levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.

Our accounting policy for claims and litigation including self-insurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.

HOW WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS

We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

For additional information regarding claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.

7. INCOME TAXES

HOW WE DETERMINE OUR

CURRENT AND

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

We file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns, including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries. We account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met

hod. Sign

ificant judgments and estimates are required in determining

our

current and deferred

tax

assets and liabilities

, which reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay

.

These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement

’s

carrying amounts

of assets and liabilities

and the

amounts used for income tax purposes

. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns

. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9 “Income Taxes” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

While

we believe that the majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized, our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforwards require additional consideration based on the following reasons:

§

the

required filing groups in many states are different from the federal filing group

§

certain states have brief expiration periods or other limitations on the utilization of net operating loss

carryforwards

§

we no longer file in certain states for which we have net operating loss carryforwards

Based on this analysis, we have provided

a valuation allowance of $

56.9

million

, an increase of $

10.6

million from the prior year valuation allowance,

against our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforward

s. O

f the $

56.9

million valuation allowance, $

55.5

million relate

s

to

our

Alabama net operating los

s c

arryforward. The remaining valuation allowance of $

1.4

million relate

s

to other state net operating los

s c

arryforwa

rds.

I

f

we

later

determine that

realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance will be reduc

ed. Con

versely, if we determine that

it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase the valuation allo

wance.

FOREIGN EARNINGS

U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore.

At least annually, we e

valuate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore

.

LIABILITY FOR

UNRECOGNIZ

ED TA

X BENEFITS

We recognize

a ta

x benefit associated with

a t

ax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained

based upon the technical merits of the position

. For a tax position that meets the

more likely than not

recognition threshold, w

e m

easure th

e t

ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realiz

ed.

A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position.

Ou

r liability

for

u

nrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments a

nd new or emerging

legislation.

The

years open

to

tax

examinations

vary

by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is

appropriate

.

We

consider a

tax position

to

be resolved

at the earlier of

the issue being “effectively settled,”

settlement of an examination

,

or

the expiration of the statute of limitati

ons. Upon resolution

of a tax position, an

y

liability for

u

nrecognized tax benefits will be

released.

Ou

r liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties

associated with our

liability for

unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits as income tax expense.

STATUTORY DEPLETION

Our largest permanent item in computing both our

taxable income and

effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9 "Income Taxes" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. In order to manage or reduce these market risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

We are exposed to interest rate risk due to our bank line of credit and other long-term debt instruments. At times, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk.

At

December 31, 201


, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt instruments including current maturities was $

2,274.8

million compared to a book value of $

2,005.6

million. The estimated fair value was determined by

averaging the asking price quotes for the notes

. The fair value estimate is based on information available as of the measurement date. Although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount, it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date. The effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our liability by $

105.1

million.

We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high-quality bonds, the expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits. The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section of this

ITEM 8

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for

each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 201


. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to

express an opinion on the financial statement

s b

ased on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of

the three years in the period ended December 31, 201


in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


, based on criteria established in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Vulcan Materials Company (the "Company," "Vulcan," "we," "our"), a New Jersey corporation, is the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates, primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as described in Note 2, the operating results of the Chemicals business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vulcan Materials Company and all our majority or

wholly-owned subsidiary companies. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of these financial statements are related to goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, reclamation costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental compliance, claims and litigation including self-insurance, and income taxes.

BUSINESS COMBINA

TIO

NS

We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable assets

acquired and liabilities assumed

based on their respective fair values. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and

assumptions.

RESTRU

CTURING CHARGES

Costs associated with restructuring our operations include severance and related charges to eliminate a specified number of employee positions, costs to relocate employees, contract cancellation costs and charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations. Relocation and contract cancellation costs and charges to vacate facilities are recognized in the period the liability is incurred. Severance charges for employees who are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, generally more than 60 days, are recognized ratably over the retention period; otherwise, the full severance charge is recognized on the date a detailed restructuring plan has been authorized by management and communicated to employees.

In 2014, we announced changes to our executive management team, and a new divisional organization structure that

was

effective January 1, 2015. This new structure enables us to pursue growth and profitability while further leveraging the actions we undertook in 2012 as noted below. During 2014, we incurred

$1,308,000

of severance costs related to these initiatives.

Future related charges for these initiatives are estimated to be less than

$5,000,000

.

In 2012, our Board approved a Profit Enhancement Plan that further leverages our streamlined management structure and substantially completed ERP and Shared Services platforms to achieve cost reductions and other earnings enhancements. During 2013 and 2012, respectively, we incurred

$1,509,000

and

$9,557,000

of costs (primarily project design, outside advisory and severance) related to the implementation of this plan. We did not incur any additional charges in

2014.

Part I

I


EXCHANGE OFFER COSTS

In response to an unsolicited and substantially undervalued exchange offer initiated in 2011, we incurred legal, professional and other defense costs of

$43,380,000

in 2012.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our extending credit to trade customers for the purchase of our products. The terms generally provide for payment within 30 days of being invoiced. On occasion, when necessary to conform to regional industry practices, we sell product under extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or unsecured short-term notes; or, on occasion, notes with durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing accounts receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from short-term transactions (less than one year) other than the sale of our products, such as interest receivable; insurance claims; freight claims; tax refund claims; bid deposits or

rents receivable. Receivables are aged and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense are recorded. Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 2014

—

$2,031,000

,


—

$602,000

and


—

$2,505,000

. Write-offs of accounts receivables for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 2014

—

$2,561,000

,


—

$1,946,000

and


—

$2,805,000

.

INVENTORIES

Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories because it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials, direct labor and production overhead. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. Substantially all operating supplies inventory is carried at average cost. For additional information regarding our inventories see Note 3.

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT

Property, plant & equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. The cost of properties held under capital leases, if any, is equal to the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease.

Capitalized software costs of

$8,753,000

and

$10,321,000

are reflected in net property, plant & equipment as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We capitalized software costs for the years ended December 31 as follows: 2014 —

$921,000

, 2013 —

$1,695,000

and 2012 —

$408,000

. During the same periods,

$2,501,000

,

$2,230,000

and

$2,463,000

, respectively, of previously capitalized costs were depreciated. For additional information regarding our property, plant & equipment see Note 4.

REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments that add materially to the utility or useful lives of property, plant & equipment are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance activities, related primarily to periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to the next overhaul.

Part I

I


DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION, ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated service lives of the various classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (


to


years), buildings (


to


years) and land improvements (


to


years). Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis beginning when the software project is substantially complete.

Cost depletion on depletable land is computed by the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units.

Accretion reflects the period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset retirement obligations. It is computed using the same credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to initially measure the liability at fair value.

Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful lives.

Amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets.

A significant portion of our intangible assets is contractual rights in place associated with zoning, permitting and other rights to access and extract aggregates reserves. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31 is outlined below:

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We periodically use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, currency exchange risk or price fluctuations on commodity energy sources consistent with our risk management policies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments are presented in Note 5.

Part I

I


FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2:

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data

Level 3:

Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement

Our assets at December 31 subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below:

We have established

two

Rabbi Trusts for the purpose of providing a level of security for the employee nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans and for the directors' nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds and equity securities for which quoted prices in active markets are available. Level 2 investments are stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying investments in those funds (short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit).

Net gain

s o

f the Rabbi Trust investments were

$1,169,000

,

$4,398,000

and

$8,564,000

for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The portions of the net gains (losses) related to investments still held by the Rabbi Trusts at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were

$(1,049,000)

,

$4,234,000

and

$9,012,000,

respectively.

The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, current maturities of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, trade payables and accruals, and all other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

There were no assets or liabilities subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis in 2013. Assets that were subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis in 2014 are summarized below:

Part I

I


We recorded a

$3,095,000

loss on impairment of long-lived assets in the first

and second

quarter

s

of 2014 reducing the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value of

$2,172,000

. Fair value was estimated using a market approach (observed transactions involving comparable assets in similar locations).

GOODWILL AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2014, goodwill totaled

$3,094,824,000

as compared to

$3,081,521,000

at December 31, 2013.

G

oodwill represents

38%

of total assets at December 31, 2014 compared to

37%

as of December 31, 2013.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment one level below our operating segments (reporting unit

). W

e have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium (formerly Cement). Within these four operating segments, we have identified


reporting units

(

of which


carry goodwill

)

based primarily on geographic

location. We

have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative

test. We

elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

The first step of the

quantitative

impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step of the

quantitative

impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

The

results of the first step of the annual impairment tests performed as of November 1, 2014, 2013 and 2012 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values. Accordingly, there were

no

charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013

or 2012.

We

estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies

). D

etermining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

For additional information regarding goodwill see Note 18.

Part I

I


IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g. asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.

As

of December 31, 2014, net property, plant & equipment represents

38%

of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents

9%

of total

assets.

During 2014, we recorded a

$3,095,000

loss on impairment of long-lived assets

related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area (see Note 19)

. We recorded no asset impairments during 2013. During 2012, we recorded a

$2,034,000

loss on impairment of long-lived assets related primarily to assets classified as held for

sale.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets see Notes 4 and 18.

TOTAL REVENUES AND REVENUE RECOGNITION

Total revenues include sales of product to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers.

Freight and delivery represen

t p

ass-through transportation we incur and pay to third-party carriers to deliver our products to customers.

The costs related to freight and delivery are included in cost of revenues.

Revenue is recognized at the time the selling price is fixed, the product's title is transferred to the buyer and collectibility of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured (typically occurs when finished products are shipped to the customer).

DEFERRED REVENUE

W

e e

ntered into

two

transactions (September 2013 and December 2012) through which we sold a percentage of the future production from aggregates reserves at

eight

quarries (

seven

owned and

one

leased). These sales were structured as volumetric production payments (VPPs). We received net cash proceeds of

$153,282,000

and

$73,644,000

for the 2013 and 2012 transactions, respectively. These proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and are amortized to revenue on a unit-of-sales basis over the terms of the VPPs. Concurrently, we entered into marketing agreements with the purchaser through which we are designated the exclusive sales agent for the purchaser’s percentage of future production. Acting as the purchaser’s agent, our consolidated total revenues exclude these sales.

The common key terms of both VPP transactions are:

STRIPPING COSTS

In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits are referred to as stripping costs.

Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered costs of extracted minerals under our inventory costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. The production stage is deemed to begin when the activities, including removal of overburden and waste material that may contain incidental saleable material, required to access the saleable product are complete. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced were

$44,896,000

in 2014,

$41,716,000

in 2013 and

$37,875,000

in 2012.

Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are excluded from our inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized and reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are expensed over the productive life of the mine using the unit-of-production method. Pre-production stripping costs included in other noncurrent assets were

$44,035,000

as of December 31, 2014 and $

24,026,000

as of December 31, 2013.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We account for share-based compensation awards using fair-value-based measurement methods. These result in the recognition of compensation expense for all share-based compensation award

s b

ased on their fair value as of the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period.

We receive an income tax deduction for share-based compensation equal to the excess of the market value of our common stock on the date of exercise or issuance over the exercise price. Tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows. The

$3,464,000

,

$161,000

and

$267,000

in excess tax benefits classified as financing cash inflows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relate to the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under long-term incentive plans.

A summary of the estimated future compensation cost (unrecognized compensation expense) as of December 31, 2014 related to share-based awards granted to employees under our long-term incentive plans is presented below:


Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights (SOSARs)

Pretax compensation expense related to our employee share-based compensation awards and related income tax benefits for the years ended December 31 are summarized below:

RECLAMATION COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation

tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

The carrying value of these obligations was

$226,565,000

as of December 31, 2014 and

$228,234,000

as of December 31, 2013. For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations) see Note 17.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The primary assumptions are as follows:

§

Discount Rate

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future

§

Expected Return on Plan Assets

— We project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs

§

Rate of Compensation Increase

— For salary-related plans only, we project employees' annual pay increases through 2015, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement

§

Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Healthcare Benefits

— We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits

.

Increases in the per capita cost after 2015 are not expected to increase our obligations related to postretirement medical benefits as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level

Accounting standards provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The differences between actual results and expected or estimated results are recognized in full in

other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in a systematic

manner over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see Note 10.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our environmental compliance costs are undiscounted and include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. We accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study.

When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2014, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was

$3,000,000

. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers.

Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates

and

key assumptions

in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. H

owever,

a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see Note 8.

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to

$2,000,000

per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to

$3,000,000

per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. The following table outlines our self-insurance program at December 31:

Estimated payments (undiscounted) under our self-insurance program for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2014 are as follows:

Part I

I


Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

INCOME TAXES

We file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns, including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries. We account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, which reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note

9.

If

we later determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance will be reduced. Conversely, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase the valuation allowance.

U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. At least annually, we evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore.

We recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than

50%

likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.

The years open to tax examinations vary by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate.

We consider a

tax position

to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled,” settlement of an examination, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Upon resolution of a tax position, an

y

liability for

u

nrecognized tax benefits will be released.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties associated with our

liability for

unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

Our largest permanent item in computing both our taxable income and effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

We report comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Equity. Comprehensive income comprises two subsets: net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI includes fair value adjustments to cash flow hedges, actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs related to pension and postretirement benefit plans.

For additional information regarding comprehensive income see Note 14.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)

Earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution (diluted EPS), as set forth below:

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our earnings per share calculations. In periods of loss, shares that otherwise would have been included in our diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding computation are excluded. These excluded shares (antidilutive common stock equivalents) were

617,000

for the loss year ended December 31, 2012.

The number of antidilutive common stock equivalents for which the exercise price exceeds the weighted-average market price for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

The separate presentation of net sales and delivery revenues previously reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income has been eliminated to conform with the 2014 presentation.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED

2014 — GUIDANCE ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT  As of and for the interim period ended March 31, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-11, "Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists." Under this ASU, an unrecognized tax benefit, or portion thereof, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward except when specific conditions are met as outlined in the ASU. When these specific conditions are met, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Part I

I


2014 —

GUIDANCE FOR OBLIGATIONS RESULTING FROM JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ARRANGEMENTS  As of and for the interim period ended March 31, 2014, we adopted ASU 2013-04, "Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date." This ASU provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of such obligations that are within the scope of the ASU. Obligations within the scope of this ASU include debt arrangements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation and judicial rulings. Under this ASU, an entity (1) recognizes such obligations at the inception of the arrangement, (2) measures such obligations as the sum of (a) the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and (b) any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors and (3) discloses the nature and amount of such obligations as well as other information about those obligations. Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

2014 —

TANGIBLE PROPERTY REGULATIONS  As of January 1, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service’s new tangible property regulations became effective. These regulations apply to amounts paid to acquire, produce or improve tangible property, as well as dispose of such property. The effect of this tax law change had no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION

GOING CONCERN  In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern (meet its obligations as they become due) within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, certain disclosures are required. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the annual period ending December 31, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

SHARE-BASED AWARDS  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, “Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period,” which clarifies the proper method of accounting for share-based awards when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. Under current guidance, there is a lack of consistency in the measurement of the grant-date fair values of awards with these types of performance targets. Under ASU 2014-12, a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after completion of the service period should be treated as a performance condition and, as a result, should not be included in the estimation of the grant-date fair value. Rather, an entity should recognize compensation cost for the award when it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. We currently account for share-based awards with these types of performance targets in accordance with ASU 2014-12; therefore, we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This ASU provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues and expands required revenue recognition disclosures. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

Part I

I


DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS REPORTING  In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,” which changes the definition of and expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations. Under the new definition, discontinued operations reporting is limited to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. The expanded disclosures for discontinued operations are meant to provide users of financial statements with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of discontinued operations. Additionally, this ASU requires an entity to disclose the pretax profit or loss of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This ASU is effective for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.

NOTE 2: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation. In addition to the initial cash proceeds, Basic Chemicals was required to make payments under

two

earn-out agreements.

During 201

the final

payment

under the 5CP earn-out

of

We provide supplemental income disclosures to facilitate comparisons with companies not on LIFO. The supplemental income calculation is derived by tax-effecting the change in the LIFO reserve for the periods presented. If all inventories valued at LIFO cost had been valued under the methods (substantially average cost) used prior to the adoption of the LIFO method, the approximate effect on net earnings would have been

NOTE 5: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to hedge against these market risks. We do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.

The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationship. The interest rate swap agreements described below were designated as either

cash flow

hedges or

fair value

hedges. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap

cash flow

hedges are recorded

in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into

interest expense

in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.

The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap

fair value

hedges are recorded

as interest expense consistent with the change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged

.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

We

have

use

d

interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in interest rates.

D

uring 2007, we entered into

fifteen

forward starting interest rate swap agreements for a total stated amount of

$1,500,000,000

. Upon the 2007 and 2008 issuances of the related fixed-rate debt, we terminated and settled these forward starting swaps for cash payments of

$89,777,000

. Amounts in

AOCI

are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Th

is amortization was reflected in the

accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 as follows:

The 2014 loss reclassified from AOCI includes the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred loss in the amount of $3,762,000 referable to the debt purchase as disclosed in Note 6.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 201


, we estimate that

$4,207,000

of the pretax loss

in

AOCI

will be reclassified to earnings.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

We

have

use

d

interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that results from fluctuations in the benchmark interest rates for such debt. In June


, we issued

$500,000,000

of

6.50%

fixed-rate notes due in 2016. Concurrently, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of

$500,000,000

. Under these agreements, we paid

6-month LIBOR

plus a spread of

4.05%

and received a fixed interest rate of

6.50%

. Additionally, in June 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our

$150,000,000

of

10.125%

fixed-rate notes due in 2015. Under these agreements, we paid

6-month LIBOR

plus a spread of

8.03%

and received a fixed interest rate of

10.125%

. In August 2011, we terminated and settled these interest rate swap agreements for

$25,382,000

of cash proceeds. The $23,387,000 forward component

of the settlement (cash proceeds less

$1,995,000

of accrued interest) was added to the carrying value of the related debt and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining lives of the related debt using the ef

fective interest method. This amortization was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 as follows:

The amortized deferred gain for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred gain in the amount of

$8,032,000

referable to the debt purchased as disclosed in Note 6.

deferred gains are being amortized using the effective interest method over the respective terms of the notes.

The estimated fair value of long-term debt presented in the table above was determined by

averaging

the asking

Our long-term debt is unsecured and essentially all such debt agreements contain customary investment-grade type covenants that primarily limit the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing the outstanding debt. Our debt may be redeemed prior to maturity at the greater of par value and the make-whole value plus accrued and unpaid interest.

There were

no

material scheduled debt payments during 2014. However, as described below, we purchased $506,366,000 principal amount o

f d

ebt through a tender offer in the first quarter of 2014.

Scheduled

debt payments during 201


included

$10,000,000

in January to retire the

8.70%

medium-term note and

$140,444,000

in June to retire the

6.30%

notes

.

The total

scheduled

(principal and interest) debt payments, excludi

ng dr

aws, if any, on

the line

of credit, for the five years subsequent to December 31, 201


are as follows:

In March 2014, we purchased

$506,366,000

principal amount o

f d

ebt through a tender offer as follows:

$374,999,000

of

6.50%

notes due in


and

$131,367,000

of

6.40%

notes due in


. This debt purchase was funded by the sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area as described in Note 1


. The March 2014 debt purchases cost

$579,659,000

, including a

$71,829,000

premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction costs of

$1,464,000

. The premium primarily reflects the trading prices of the notes relative to par prior to the tender offer commencement. Additionally, we recognized a net benefit of

$344,000

associated with the acceleration of a proportional amount of unamortized discounts, deferred gains, deferred financing costs and amounts accumulated in OCI. The combined charge of

$72,949,000

is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the

year ended December 31

, 2014.

Additionally, i

n

March



, we

amended our

$500,000,000

line of credit

to, among other items, extend the term from March 2018 to March 2019. The line of credit is secured by accounts receivable and inventory, but will become unsecured upon the achievement of certain credit metrics and/or credit ratings. The line of credit also

contains negative

and financial covenants

customary

for a secured facility.

The negative covenants primarily limit our ability to: (1) incur secured debt, (2) make

certain

investments, (3) execute acquisitions and divestitures, and (4) make restricted payments, including dividends. Such limitations currently do not impact our ability to execute our strategic, operating and financial plans, and become less restrictive when the line of credit becomes unsecured as described above.

The line of credit contains two financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA that declines over time to

3.5

:1 and (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to

net cash

interest

expense

that increases over time to

3.0

:1.

As of December 31, 2014, w

e

were

in

compliance with

our long-term debt and line of credit covenants

.

Borrowings on our line of credit are classified as short-term due to our intent to repay any borrowings within twelve months. As of December 31, 2014, our available borrowing capacity was

$

446,450,000

.

Borrowings under

the line

of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from

1.50%

to

2.25%, or an alternative rate derived from the lender's prime rate,

based on

ou

r

ratio of

d

ebt to EBITD

A.

As of December 31, 2014

, the applicable margin

for LIBOR based borrowing

s

was

1.50%

.

Standby letters of credit issued under the line of credit reduce availability and are charged a fee equal to the margin for LIBOR based borrowings plus

0.175%

. We also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the line of credit. This commitment fee ranges from

0.25%

to

0.40%

based on ou

r

ratio of

d

ebt to EBITDA.

At December 31, 2014, the commitment fee was 0.25%.

Once the line of credit becomes unsecured, both the LIBOR margin range for borrowings and the commitment fee range will decline.

Lease agreements frequently include renewal options and require that we pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense. Options to purchase are also included in some lease agreements.

NOTE 8: ACCRUED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 include accrued environmental remediation costs

(m

The accrued environmental remediation costs in continuing operations relate primarily to the former Florida Rock,

Tarmac, and

CalMat facilities acquired in 2007,

2000 and

1999, respectively. The balances noted above for Chemicals relate to retained environmental remediation costs from the 2003 sale of the Performance Chemicals business and the 2005 sale of the Chloralkali business.

NOTE 10: BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor

three

funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees hired prior to July 2007, other than those covered by union-administered plans. Normal retirement age is


, but the plans contain provisions for earlier retirement. Benefits for the Salaried

Plan

and the Chemicals Hourly Plan

are

generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the Construction Materials Hourly Plan

provide

s

benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of service.

In addition to these qualified plans, we sponsor

three

unfunded, nonqualified pension plans. The projected benefit obligation presented in the table below includes

$101,230,000

and

$93,600,000

, respectively, related to these

unfunded, nonqualified pension

plans for 201


and 201


.

Effective July 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans to no longer accept new participants.

In

December

2013, we amended our defined benefit pension plans so that future

service

accruals for salaried pension participants ceased effective December 31, 2013. This change included

a

special transition provision which will allow

covered compensation

through December 31, 2015 to be considered in the participants’ benefit calculations. The amendment resulted in a curtailment and remeasurement of the salaried and nonqualified pension plans in May 2013 that reduced our 2013 pension expense by approximately

$7,600,000

(net of the one-time curtailment loss) of which

$800,000

was related to discontinued operations.

The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the plans and their reconciliation with the related amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements at December 31:


The 2013 amendment eliminated future accruals for salaried pension participants effective December 31, 2013.

Part I

The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) exceeded plan assets for all of our defined benefit plans at

December 31, 20


and

all plans except the Chemicals Hourly Plan at December 31,

2013. At

December 31, 2013, a

ssets in the Chemicals Hourly Plan of

$91,803,000

exceeded its ABO by

$3,919,000

and its PBO by

$3,056,000

. The ABO for all of our defined benefit pension plans totaled

$1,061,816,000

(unfunded, nonqualified plans of

$95,154,000)

at December 31, 2014 and

$891,394,000

(unfunded, nonqualified plans of

$89,289,000)

at December 31, 2013.

The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost, amounts recognized in other comprehensive income and weighted-average assumptions of the plans at December 31:

Part I

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension benefit cost during 201


are

$20,762,000

and

$47,000

,

respectively.

Assumptions regarding our expected return on plan assets are based primarily on judgments made by us and

the Finance

Committee

of our Board

. These judgments take into account the expectations of our pension plan consultants and actuaries and o

ur investment

advisors. We

base our expected return on long-term investment expectations. The expected return on plan assets used to determine 201


pension benefit cost was

7.50%

.

We establish our pension investment policy by evaluating asset/liability studies periodically performed by our consultants. These studies estimate trade-offs between expected returns on our investments and the variability in anticipated cash contributions to fund our pension liabilities. Our policy balances the variability in potential pension fund contributions to expected returns on our investments.

Our current strategy for implementing this policy is to invest in publicly traded equities and in publicly traded debt and private, nonliquid opportunities, such as venture capital, commodities, buyout funds and mezzanine debt. The target allocation ranges for plan assets are as follows: equity securities —

50%

to

77%;

debt securities —

15%

to

27%;

specialty investments —

0%

to

20%;

commodities — 0% to 6%;

and cash reserves —

0%

to

5%

. Equity securities include domestic investments and foreign equities in the Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Emerging Market Indices. Debt securities

primarily

include domestic debt instruments, while specialty investments include investments in venture capital, buyout funds, mezzanine debt

,

private partnerships and an interest in a commodity index fund.

The fair values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 201


and 201


by asset category are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2014


See Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements for a description of the fair value hierarchy.

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2013


See Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements for a description of the fair value hierarchy.

Part I

I


At each measurement date, we estimate the fair value of our pension assets using various valuation techniques. We utilize, to the extent available, quoted market prices in active markets or observable market inputs in estimating the fair value of our pension assets. When quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not available, we utilize valuation techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of our pension assets. The following describes the types of investments included in each asset category listed in the table

s

above and the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair values as of December 31,

2014 and



.

The debt securities category consists of bonds issued by U.S. federal, state and local governments, corporate debt securities, fixed income obligations issued by foreign governments, and asset-backed securities. The fair values of U.S. government and corporate debt securities are based on current market rates and credit spreads for debt securities with similar maturities. The fair values of debt securities issued by foreign governments are based on prices obtained from broker/dealers and international indices. The fair values of asset-backed securities are priced using prepayment speed and spread inputs that are sourced from the new issue market.

Investment funds consist of exchange traded and non-exchange traded

funds. The

commodity funds asset category consists of a single open-end commodity mutual fund. The equity funds asset category consists of index funds for domestic equities and an actively managed fund for international equities. The short-term funds asset category consists of a collective investment trust invested in highly liquid, short-term debt securities. For investment funds publicly traded on a national securities exchange, the fair value is based on quoted market prices. For investment funds not traded on an exchange, the total fair value of the underlying securities is used to determine the net asset value for each unit of the fund held by the pension fund. The estimated fair values of the underlying securities are generally valued based on quoted market prices. For securities without quoted market prices, other observable market inputs are utilized to determine the fair value.

The venture capital and partnerships asset category consists of various limited partnership funds, mezzanine debt funds and leveraged buyout funds. The fair value of these investments has been estimated based on methods employed by the general partners, including consideration of, among other things, reference to third-party transactions, valuations of comparable companies operating within the same or similar industry, the current economic and competitive environment, creditworthiness of the corporate issuer, as well as market prices for instruments with similar maturity, term, conditions and quality ratings. The use of different assumptions, applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value of these securities.

our pension

plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31

, 2013 and 2014

is presented below:

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements for union-represented employees. A multiemployer plan is subject to collective bargaining for employees of two or more unrelated companies. Multiemployer plans are managed by boards of trustees on which management and labor have equal representation. However, in most cases, management is not directly represented. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans differ from single employer plans as follows:

§

assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers

§

if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers

§

if we cease to have an obligation to contribute to one or more of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability

None of the multiemployer pension plans that we participate in are individually significant. Our co

ntributions to individual multiemployer pension funds did not exceed

5%

of the fund’s total contributions in the three years ended December 31, 20


, 2013 and 2012

.

Total

contributions to multiemployer

pension plans were

$8,503,000

in 2014,

$7,580,000

in 2013 and

$7,227,000

in 2012.

As of December 31, 201


, a total of

15%

of our domestic hourly labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of such employees covered by collective bargaining agreements,

12%

were covered by agreements that expire in 201


. We also employed


union employees in Mexico

who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in 201


.

None

of

our union employees in Mexico

plans.

In

addition to the pension plans noted above, we had one unfunded supplemental retirement plan as of December 31, 201


and 201


. The accrued costs for the supplemental retirement plan were

$1,421,000

at December 31, 2014 and

$1,328,000

at December 31, 2013

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees.

In 2012, we amended our postretirement healthcare plan to cap our portion of the medical coverage cost at the 2015

level.

Substantially all our salaried employees and where applicable, hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying age and meet certain service requirements. Generally, Company-provided healthcare benefits terminate when covered individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach age


, whichever occurs first.

The

March 2014 sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area (see Note 19) significantly reduced total expected future service of our postretirement plans resulting in a

reduction in the projected benefit obligation of $2,639,000 and a

one-time curtailment gain of

$3,832,000

. This gain was reflected within gain on sale of property, plant & equipment, net in our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ASSUMPTIONS

Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. We also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high-quality bonds. At December 31, 201


, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from

3.50%

to

4.30%

(December 31,


ranged from

3.80%

to

5.15%)

.

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 201


, the expected return on plan assets

remained at

7.50%

.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience and future expectations. At December 31, 201


, our projected weighted-average rate of compensation

increase

was

3.70%

, u

p from 3.50% at December 31, 2013.

In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 201


, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits

remained at

7.50%

for 201


, decreasing each year until reaching

5.0%

in


and

r

emaining level thereafter.

Increases in the per capita cost after 2015 are not expected to increase our obligations related to postretirement medical benefits as a result of the 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level.

NOTE 11: INCENTIVE PLANS

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Our 2006 Omnibus Long-term Incentive Plan (Plan) authorizes the granting of stock options, Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights (SOSARs) and other types of share-based awards to key salaried employees and non-employee directors. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan is

$16,863,000

in 2014,

$16,159,000

in 2013 and

$12,151,000

The following table presents the weighted-average fair value and the weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of

grants during the

years ended

December 31:


No SOSARs were granted in 2012.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity period approximating

the SOSARs

expected term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts

adjusted for current expectations of future payouts

. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility and expectations about future volatility of our common stock over a period equal to

the SOSARs

expected

term. The

expected term is based on historical experience and expectations about future exercises and represents the period of time

that SOSARs

granted are expected to be outstanding.

A summary of our stock option/SOSAR activity as of December 31, 201


and changes during the year are presented below:

The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between our stock price on the last trading day of



and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options/SOSARs) that would have been received by the option holders had all options/SOSARs been exercised on December 31, 201


. These values change based on the fair market value of our common stock. The aggregate intrinsic values of options

Certain of our aggregates reserves are burdened by volumetric production payments (nonoperating interest) as described in Note 1

under the caption Deferred Revenue

. As the holder of the working interest, we have responsibility to bear the cost of mining and producing the reserves attributable to this nonoperating interest.

We provide

, in the normal course of business, certain third party beneficiaries

standby letters of credit

to support

our obligations to pay or perform

according to the requirements of an u

nderlying agreement.

Such

letters of credit

typically have an initial term of one year, typically renew automatically, and can only be modified or cancelled with the approval of the beneficiary. All of our standby letters of credit are issued by banks that participate in our

$500,000,000

line of credit, and reduce the borrowing capacity thereunder. We pay a fee for all standby letters of credit equal to the margin (ranges from

1.50%

to

2.25

%) applicable to LIBOR based borrowings under the line of credit, plus

0.175%

.

Our

standby letters of credit as of December 31, 201


are summarized

by purpose

in the table below:

As described in Note 9, our liability for unrecogniz

as of December 31, 201


.

We

are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.

We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as potential obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While ultimate resolution and financial liability is uncertain at a number of the sites, in our opinion based on information currently available, the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to these sites will not have a

material effect

on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for that period. Amounts accrued for environmental matters are presented in

Note 8.

We are

a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine with precision the outcome, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.

In addition to these lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, certain other

material

legal proceedings are specifically described below.

Part I

I


LOWER PASSAIC RIVER

MATTER

§

Lower Passaic River Study Area (Superfund Site)

— The Lower Passaic River Study Area is part of the Diamond Shamrock Superfund Site in New Jersey. Vulcan and approximately 70 other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River (River).

O

n April 11, 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) that calls for a bank-to-bank dredging remedy for the lower 8 miles of the River. The EPA estimates that the cost of implementing this proposal is approximately

$950

million to

$1.73

billion. The period for public comment on the proposed FFS

is closed

.

The RI/FS should be completed in 2015, and

it is anticipated that the

EPA will issue its final record of decision sometime in 2015.

At

this time,

we cannot reasonably estimate

our ultimate

liability related to this

matter. Furthermore

, t

he AOC does not obligate us to fund or perform the remedial action contemplated by either the RI/FS or the FFS.

Vulcan formerly owned a chemicals operation near River Mile 0.1, which was sold in 1974. T

he Company has found no evidence that

its former chemicals operation

contribute

d an

y of the primary contaminants of concern to th

e Ri

ve

r. N

either the ultimate remedial approach and associated costs

(or range of costs)

, nor the parties who will participate in funding the remediation and their respective allocation

s, h

av

e be

en determined.

Based on the facts available at this time, we believe our liability related to any remedial actions will be immaterial.

OTHER LITIGATION

§

TEXAS BRINE MATTER

—

During the operation of its former Chemicals Division, Vulcan was the lessee to a salt lease from 1976 – 2005 in an underground salt dome formation in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. The Texas Brine Company operated this salt mine for the account of Vulcan. Vulcan sold its Chemicals Division in 2005 and assigned the lease to the purchaser, and Vulcan has had no association with the leased premises or Texas Brine Company since that time. In August 2012, a sinkhole developed near the salt dome and numerous lawsuits were filed in state court in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Other lawsuits, including class action litigation, were also filed in August 2012 in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans.

Certain of the plaintiffs and Texas Brine settled the Federal Court class action for approximately

$48.1

million. This settlement has been approved by the court, and the settlement process is now subject to the terms of the court’s order and settlement agreement. Vulcan is named as a released party in the settlement agreement along with the other released parties, including Texas Brine, and its insurers. Texas Brine and its insurers did not, however, release Vulcan from any alleged claims, including claims for contribution and indemnity.

There are numerous defendants to the litigation in state and federal court. Vulcan was first brought into the litigation as a third-party defendant in August 2013 by the Texas Brine Company. Vulcan has since been added as a direct and third-party defendant by other parties, including a direct claim by the State of Louisiana. The damages alleged in the litigation range from individual plaintiffs’ claims for property damage, to the State of Louisiana’s claim for response costs, to claims for

alleged physical damages to oil pipelines, to various alleged business interruption claims, and to claims for indemnity and

contribution from Texas Brine. It is alleged that

the sinkhole was caused, in whole or in part, by Vulcan’s negligent actions or failure to act. It is also alleged that Vulcan breached the salt lease, as well as an operating agreement with Texas Brine.

Vulcan denies any liability in this matter and will vigorously defend the litigation. We cannot reasonably estimate any liability related to this matter.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and a number of factors, including developments in ongoing discovery or adverse rulings,

or the verdict of a particular jury,

could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued costs. No liability was recorded for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be only reasonably possible or for which a loss could not be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in defense of lawsuits are expensed as incurred. In addition, losses on certain claims and litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a per occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described in Note 1 under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.

NOTE 15: SEGMENT REPORTING

We have

four

operating

(and

reporting

)

segments organized around our principal product lines:

A

ggregates,

A

sphalt

M

ix,

C

oncrete and

Calcium (formerly

Cement).

Th

e Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel, sand, and other aggregates) and related products and services (transportation and

other). During



, the Aggregates segment principally served markets in

twenty

states,

Washington D.C.

and Mexico with a full line of aggregates, and

five

additional states with railroad ballast. Customers use aggregates primarily in the construction and maintenance of highways, streets and other public works and in the construction of housing and commercial, industrial and other nonresidential facilities. Customers are served by truck, rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities and sales yards. Due to the high weight-to-value ratio of aggregates, markets generally are local in nature. Quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be available. We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the United States. Nondomestic

revenues

were

$14,699,000

in 2014,

$12,339,000

in 2013 and

$14,733,000

in 2012

.

The Asphalt Mix segment produces and sells asphalt mix

in

four

states

primarily in our southwestern and western markets.

The Concrete segment produces and sells ready-mixed

concrete in

six

state

s,

Washington D.C.

and the Bahamas

.

Subsequently, in January 2015 we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona.

In March 2014, we sold our concrete business in the Florida area (see Note 19) which in addition to ready-mixed concrete, included concrete block, precast concrete, as well as building materials purchased for resale.

The

Calcium

segment currently consists of a Florida facility that mines, produces and sells calcium products. Prior to the sale of our cement business in March 2014 (see Note 19), we produced and sold Portland and masonry cement in both bulk and bags from our Florida cement plant and imported and exported cement, clinker and slag and either resold, ground, blended, bagged or reprocessed those materials from other Florida facilities.

Aggregates comprise approximately

95%

of asphalt mix by weight and

78%

of ready-mixed concrete by weight. Our Asphalt Mix

and

Concrete segments are

primarily

supplied with their aggregates requirements from our Aggregates segment. These intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of product utilized in the production of asphalt mix

and

ready-mixed concrete. Customers for our Asphalt Mix

and

Concrete segments are generally served locally at our production facilities or by truck. Because asphalt mix

and

ready-mixed concrete harden rapidly, delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately


to


miles from the producing

facility.

The

vast majority of our activities are domestic. Long-lived assets outside the United States, which consist primarily of property, plant & equipment, were

$139,427,000

in 2014,

$140,504,000

in 2013 and

$138,415,000

in 2012

.

Equity method investments of

$22,924,000

in 2014,

$22,962,000

in 2013 and

$22,965,000

in 2012

NOTE

16: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW

INFORMATION

Supplemental information referable to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is summarized below:

NOTE 17: ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets.

Recognition of a liability for an ARO is required in the period in which it is incurred at its estimated fair value. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. If the ARO

is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement.

We record all AROs for which we have legal obligations for land reclamation at estimated fair value. Essentially all these AROs relate to our underlying land parcels, including both owned properties and mineral leases. For the years ended December 31, we recognized ARO operating costs related to accretion of the liabilities and depreciation of the assets as follows:

ARO operating costs are reported in cost of

revenues

. AROs are reported within

o

ther noncurrent liabilities in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Reconciliations of the carrying amounts of our

AROs

for the years ended December 31 are

as follows:

The ARO liabilities incurred during 2014

relate primarily to the 2014 acquisitions (see Note 19).

Part I

I


The

increase in liabilities settled during 2014 and the

ARO liabilities incurred during 2013 relate primarily to reclamation activities required under a development agreement and a conditional use permit at an aggregates facility on owned property in Southern California. Upward revisions to our ARO liability during 2013 are largely attributable to an adjacent aggregates facility on owned property.

T

he reclamation requirements at this property will result in the restoration and development of mined proper

ty s

uitable for commercial and retail developmen

t

. The estimated cost to fill and compact the property increased and the estimated settlement date decreased resulting in an upward revision to

the ARO.

NOTE 18: GOODWILL

AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Acquired identifiable

intangible assets

are classified

into three categories: (1) goodwill, (2) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization and (3) intangible assets with indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually. For additional information regarding our policies on impairment reviews, see Note 1 under the captions

“

Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment,

”

and

“

Impairment of Long-lived Assets excluding Goodwill.

”

GOODWILL

Goodwill is recognized when the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible and

identifiable

intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for

impairment. There

were

no

charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31,

2014,

.

We have

four

reportable segments organized around our principal product lines:

A

ggregates,

A

sphalt

M

ix,

C

oncrete and

Calcium (formerly C

ement

)

. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31,

2014,

are summarized below:


The goodwill

for the

Calcium (formerly

Cement

)

segment of $252,664 thousand was fully impaired in 2008

.


Refer to Note 19 for additional details.

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying

value. A

decrease

in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of

goodwill.

Part I

I


INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are stated at their fair value determined as of the date of acquisition. Costs incurred to renew or extend the life of existing intangible assets are capitalized. These capitalized renewal/extension costs were immaterial for the years presented. Intangible assets consist of contractual rights in place (primarily permitting and zoning rights), noncompetition agreements, favorable lease agreements, customer relationships and trade names and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired individually or otherwise obtained outside a business combination consist primarily of permitting, permitting compliance and zoning rights and are stated at their historical cos

t l

ess accumulated

amortization.

See

Note 19 for the details of the intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions during 201


, 2013

and 2012

.

Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

Intangible

assets are

reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were

no

charges for impairment of intangible assets in the years ended December 31,



,


3 and



.

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major intangible asset class for the years ended December 31 are summarized below:


Includes costs to obtain permitting, permitting compliance and zoning rights – both in a business combination or outside a business combination.


All trade names and trademarks and a majority of our customer relationship intangibles were associated with our Florida cement and concrete businesses which were sold in 2014 (see Note 19).

The 2014 acquisitions listed above are reported in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The amounts of total revenues, net earnings and acquisition related costs for these acquisitions (collectively) are included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for year ended December 31, 2014 as follows:

None of the 2014 acquisitions listed above are material to our results of

operations or financial position either

individually or collectively. The fair value of consideration transferred for these acquisitions and the preliminary amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (based on their estimated fair values at their acquisition dates), are summarized below:

Part I

I


Estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary pending appraisals of contractual rights in place and property, plant & equipment.

The contractual rights in place noted above will be amortized against earnings using the unit-of-production method over an estimated weighted-average period in excess of


years and all but

$36,921,000

will be deductible for income tax purposes over


years. The goodwill noted above (

none

of which will be deductible for income tax purposes) represents the balance of deferred tax liabilities generated from carrying over the seller’s tax basis in the assets acquired.

In 2014, we sold:

. We retained all of our Florida aggregates operations, our

former

Cement segment’s calcium operation in Brooksville, Florida and real estat

e a

ssociated with certain former ready-mixed concrete facilities. Under a separate supply agreement, we will continue to provide aggregates to the divested concrete facilities, at market prices, for a period of

ACQUISITIONS

AND

DIVESTITURES

In 2013, we acquired:

§

land containing


million tons of aggregates reserves at an existing quarry in southern California for

$117,000,000

. We previously operated this quarry under a lease which was scheduled to expire in 2017

§

one

aggregates production facility and

four

ready-mixed concrete facilities in Texas for

$29,983,000

. As a result, we recognized

$5,425,000

of amortizable intangible assets (contractual rights in place). The contractual rights in place will be amortized against earnings using the unit-of-production method over an estimated weighted-average period in excess of


years and will be deductible for income tax purposes over


years

§

two

aggregates production facilities in Georgia for

$59,968,000

. After finalizing the purchase price allocation, we recognized

$3,620,000

of amortizable intangible assets (contractual rights in place). The contractual rights in place will be amortized against earnings using the unit-of-production method over an estimated weighted-average period in excess of


years and will be deductible for income tax purposes over


years

In 2013, we sold:

§

reclaimed

land associated with a former site of a ready-mixed concrete facility in Virginia for net pretax cash proceeds of

$11,261,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

$9,027,000

§

a percentage of the future production from aggregates reserves at certain owned quarries. The sale was structured as a volumetric production payment (VPP) for which we received gross cash proceeds of

$154,000,000

and incurred transaction costs of

$905,000

. The net proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized on a unit-of-sales basis to revenues over the term of the VPP

. See Note 1, caption Deferred Revenue, for the key terms of the VPP

§

four

aggregates production facilities in Wisconsin for net pretax cash proceeds of

$34,743,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

. We allocated

$4,521,000

of goodwill to these dispositions based on the relative fair values of the businesses disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit retained. Additionally, the dispositions of these facilities will likely result in a partial withdrawal from one of our multiemployer pension plans; therefore, we recognized a

$4,000,000

liability related to this plan

§

one

aggregates production facility in Wisconsin and its related replacement reserve land for net pretax cash proceeds of

$5,133,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

ctive land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility. We strive to achieve value through our mining activities as well as incremental value through effective post-mining land management. Our land management strategy includes routinely reclaiming and selling our previously mined land. Additionally, this strategy includes developing conservation banks by preserving land as a suitable habitat for endangered or sensitive species. These conservation banks have received approval from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to offer mitigation credits for sale to third parties who may be required to compensate for the loss of habitats of endangered or sensitive species.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES

We maintain a system of controls

and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a - 15(e) or 15d -


5(e)), include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other management officials, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 201


. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

As part of

the

divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area, we entered into a Transition Service

s

Agreement with the buyer, whereby we agreed to

continue to provide certain services for

the divested facilitie

s d

uring 2014. All

services

were

performed

utilizing

our existing systems and under our current control environment. The service agreement d

id

not require significant changes to our current control environment beyond ensuring proper segregation of duties ove

r p

rocessing of third-party transactions. Controls were established and implemented to facilitate proper handling o

f t

hird-party data, including controls to protect against comingling of information and controls to prevent improper access

to information.

Procedures put in place to facilitate the Transition Services Agreement did not materially impact our controls over financial reporting during 2014.

On November 1, 2014, we completed our obligations under the Transition Services Agreement for the sold concrete facilities and the buyer began processing the transactions for the newly acquired concrete facilities in their systems. We provided information support for the buyer’s concrete operations through December 31, 2014. A new Transition Services Agreement was put in place for cement operations through March 31, 2015.

No other changes were made

MANAGEMENT

'S REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management's supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework (


)

issued by

the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 201


.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


. Deloitte & Touche LLP's report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, follows this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM – INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 201


based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated

Framework (


)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the

effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective

internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding

of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


based on the criteria

established in
