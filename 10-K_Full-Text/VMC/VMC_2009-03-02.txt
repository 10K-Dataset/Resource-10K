Item 1. Business

Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “Vulcan,”
the “company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Vulcan Materials Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries. In November 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Florida Rock
Industries, Inc. (“Florida Rock”) in a series of mergers, collectively referred to as the “Florida
Rock merger.” Unless otherwise noted, all information presented in this report regarding Vulcan
includes the consolidated results of Florida Rock.

We provide
the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to drive the U.S. economy. Headquartered in
Birmingham, Alabama, we are the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates, primarily
crushed stone, sand and gravel, a major producer of asphalt mix and concrete and a leading producer
of cement in Florida. We are a New Jersey corporation that was incorporated on February 14, 2007.

We have three reporting segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt
mix and Concrete, and Cement. We have combined our Asphalt mix and Concrete operations into one
reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses exhibit similar economic
characteristics, product processes, types and classes of customer, methods of distribution and
regulatory environments.

Aggregates Segment Overview

Construction aggregates include crushed stone, sand and gravel, rock asphalt and recycled concrete.
Aggregates are essential infrastructure materials required by the U. S. economy, and are employed
in virtually all types of construction, including highway construction and maintenance, and in the
production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Aggregates also are widely used as railroad
track ballast. The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates and related products and
services in eight regional divisions. Our Aggregates segment constituted approximately 65%, 76% and
76% of our sales dollars before the elimination of intersegment sales in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. In 2008, 93% of our sales dollars were referable to aggregates or asphalt
mix and concrete that included our aggregates.

During
2008, the Aggregates segment served markets in 23 states, the District of Columbia, the
Bahamas, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile, and Mexico with a full line of aggregates, and 7
additional states with railroad ballast. Customers are served by truck, rail and water distribution
networks from our production facilities and sales yards. Due to the high weight-to-value ratio of
aggregates, markets generally are local in nature. Quarries located on waterways and rail lines
allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be available. We sell a
relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the United States. Nondomestic net sales
were $25,295,000 in 2008, $19,981,000 in 2007, and $20,595,000 in 2006.

Each type of aggregates is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates, as well
as the same type of aggregates. Because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the
business, competition generally is limited to areas in proximity to production facilities.
Noteworthy exceptions are areas where there are no economically viable deposits of aggregates.
These areas include sections of the Mississippi, Tennessee-Tombigbee and James River systems, and
the Gulf Coast and South Atlantic Coast, which are served from remote quarries by barge, oceangoing
vessels or railroad. During 2008, we shipped 204.3 million tons
into 23 states, the District of
Columbia, the Bahamas, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile and Mexico from 331 aggregates production
facilities and sales yards. The 10 largest states that we serve, measured by aggregates shipments,
accounted for 82% of total aggregates shipments.

At the end of 2008, we operated 175 crushed stone plants, 47 sand and gravel plants and 20 plants
producing other aggregates (principally recycled concrete). Reserves largely determine the ongoing
viability of an aggregates business. For a discussion of our estimated proven and probable
aggregates reserves as of the end of 2008, see Item 2 “Properties” below. Our current estimate of
13.3 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase of 5.0
billion tons since the end of 1998. During that same period we produced approximately 2.3 billion
tons of aggregates. We believe that these reserves are sufficient to last, on average, 51.7 years
at current annual production rates. We do not anticipate any material difficulties in the
availability of raw materials in the near future.



In addition to our 242 aggregates production facilities, at the end of 2008, we operated 89 truck,
rail and water distribution yards located in select markets for the sale of aggregates.
Additionally, at the end of 2008, our Aggregates segment included 15 aggregates related operations
for equipment service and repair, landfill and transportation.

Zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction
aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets.
Although we cannot predict future governmental policies affecting the construction materials
industry, we believe that future zoning and permitting costs will not have a materially adverse
effect on our business. However, future land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning and
permitting more difficult. Any such restrictions, while potentially curtailing expansion in certain
areas, could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations.

We strive to maintain a sufficient level of aggregates inventory to meet delivery requirements of
our customers. We generally provide our customers with 30-day payment terms, similar to those
customary for the construction aggregates industry.

Asphalt mix and Concrete Segment Overview

The Asphalt mix and Concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete in
four regional divisions serving 8 states primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Florida, southwestern and
western markets, the Bahamas and the District of Columbia. Additionally, two of the divisions
produce and sell other concrete products such as block, prestressed and precast beams, and resell
purchased building materials related to the use of ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.
Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 78% of ready-mixed concrete by
weight. Our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment is almost wholly supplied with its aggregates
requirements from our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices
for the particular grade and quality of material utilized in the production of asphalt mix and
concrete. Customers for our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment are generally served locally from our
production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly,
delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately 20 to 25 miles
from the producing facility. Our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment constituted approximately 32%,
24% and 24% of our sales dollars before the elimination of intersegment sales in 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively.

The crushed rock, sand and gravel used as raw materials by our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment are
almost wholly supplied by our Aggregates segment. Therefore, like the Aggregates segment, the
Asphalt mix and Concrete segment relies upon our reserves of aggregates. Concrete production also
requires cement. In the Florida market, our requirement for cement for concrete production is
substantially supplied by our Florida Rock Division. In other markets, we purchase cement from
third party suppliers. The asphalt production process also requires liquid asphalt. We do not
anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to
operate.

Cement Segment Overview

Our Newberry, Florida cement plant produces Portland and masonry cement which is sold in both bulk
form and bags to the concrete products industry. The Brooksville, Florida plant produces calcium
products for the animal feed, paint, plastics and joint compound industries. The Tampa, Florida
facility imports cement and slag where some of the imported cement is resold and the balance of the
cement is blended, bagged or reprocessed into specialty cements which are then sold. The slag is
ground and sold in blended or unblended form. The Port Manatee, Florida facility imports clinker that
is ground into bulk cement and sold.

The Cement segment’s largest customer is our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment.

We are in the process of expanding our Newberry facility to double its production capacity.
Construction began on this project in 2006 and is expected to be completed in the second half of
2009. The Newberry cement plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility. The limestone
reserves at the Newberry cement facility total 194.7 million tons, or 75 years of life at expected
production rates based on the increased plant capacity.



The Brooksville calcium facility is supplied by high quality calcium carbonate material mined at
the Brooksville quarry. The calcium carbonate reserves at this quarry total approximately 6.9
million tons, or 9 years of life at expected production rates and based on a lease termination.

As shown in the table above, primary end uses for our products include public construction, such as
highways, bridges, airports, schools, prisons and other public buildings, as well as private
nonresidential (e.g., manufacturing, retail, offices, industrial and institutional) and private
residential construction (i.e., single-family and multi-family). Following is a more detailed
discussion of the most significant of these end uses.



End Markets

Public

— This construction end market is generally the most aggregates intensive. The primary end
uses include transportation-related infrastructure such as highways, bridges and airports as well
as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems,
dams and reservoirs. Public buildings for government and education are also important end markets
for consumption of our products. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from
both public and private sources. In 2008, publicly funded construction accounted for 45% of our
total aggregates shipments.

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than in the private end markets, in
part because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and often is supported by
multi-year legislation and programs. Public construction projects are typically funded through a
combination of federal, state and local sources. The federal transportation bill is the principal
source of federal funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. Federal highway
spending is primarily determined by a six-year authorization bill, now covering fiscal years
2004-2009, and annual budget appropriations using funds largely taken from the Federal Highway
Trust Fund, which receives taxes on gasoline and other levies. Specific highway and bridge projects
are typically managed by state transportation departments, which obligate their portion of federal
revenues and supplement this federal funding with state fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees and
general fund appropriations. States also transfer funds to counties and municipalities to fund
local street construction and maintenance. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies
across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. Other public
infrastructure construction includes airports, sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply
systems, dams, reservoirs and government buildings. Construction for power plants and other
utilities is funded from both public and private sources.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Act) was signed into law on February 17,
2009 for the purpose of creating jobs and restoring economic growth through, among other things,
the modernization of America’s infrastructure and the enhancement of its energy resources. Since
the Act is expected to generate significant construction spending, demand for our products should
increase. The Act allocates $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. Also, construction activity will
increase due to spending allocated to the following areas: $1.1 billion for airports; $8.4 billion
for mass transit; $8.0 billion for high speed rail; $4.6 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers;
$6.0 billion for water and sewer projects; $4.2 billion for United States Department of Defense
facilities; $6.4 billion to clean nuclear weapon sites; $6.0 billion to subsidize loans for
renewable energy; $20 billion for renewable energy tax incentives; $6.3 billion to states for
energy efficiency and clean energy grants; $8.8 billion for the renovation of schools; and $6.6
billion for a first time homebuyer credit of $8,000. The effects of the Act will not be felt for
several months because Congress will have to appropriate funds for these programs and each state
will have to take appropriate measures to take advantage of such funding. We expect that the
economic stimulus plan will provide incremental demand for our major product lines starting in the
second half of 2009. We cannot predict the full impact of the spending under the Act on our
business, and the extent and timing of the spending is uncertain at this time.

Private

— This construction end market includes both nonresidential and residential construction.
In 2008, privately-funded construction accounted for 55% of our total aggregates shipments.

Private nonresidential construction includes a wide array of project types and generally is more
aggregates intensive than residential construction but less aggregates intensive than public
construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential construction is generally driven by job
growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. Strong corporate
profits and growth of the private workforce generate demand for offices, hotels and restaurants.
Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking
decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such
as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply its
parts and assemblies. Additionally, construction activity in this end market is influenced by a
firm’s ability to finance and the cost of such financing.

The majority of residential construction activity is for single-family houses with the remainder
consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and
condominiums). Public housing comprises a small portion of the housing supply. Household formation
is a primary driver of housing demand along with



mortgage rates. In the last 10 years, the number of households in the United States has increased
11% from 103.2 million to 114.6 million, or approximately 15% on average, in the markets we serve.
Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage
financing. Demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of
residential construction and later as part of the foundation, driveway or parking lot.

Other

Ballast is sold to railroads for construction and maintenance of track. Riprap and jetty stone are
sold for erosion control along waterways. Stone also can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime
plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use
limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder also
can be sold as agricultural lime.

Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Our Business

Virtually all our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Our financial results for any
individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year, due
primarily to the effect that seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can have on the
production and sales volumes of our products. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are attained
in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and
earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to
cyclical swings in construction spending. These cyclical swings are further affected by
fluctuations in interest rates, and demographic and population fluctuations.

Financial Results

Net sales, total revenues, earnings from continuing operations, earnings from continuing operations
per common share, total assets, long-term obligations and cash dividends declared per common share
for the five years ended December 31, 2008, are reported under Item 6 “Selected Financial Data”
below.

Competition and Customers

The products of all of our reporting segments are marketed under highly competitive conditions,
including competition in price, service and product performance. In most of the markets we serve,
there are a substantial number of competitors.

We are the largest producer of construction aggregates in the United States. We estimate that the
10 largest aggregates producers in the nation produce 35% to 40% of all aggregates in the U.S.
There are many small, independent producers of aggregates, resulting in highly fragmented markets
in some areas. Therefore, depending on the market, we may compete with a number of large regional
and small local producers. Since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to
their value, an important competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is the
transportation cost necessary to deliver product to the location where it is used. We focus on
serving metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in
population in the future. Due to the high weight-to-value ratio of aggregates, markets generally
are local in nature. They often consist of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or
portions thereof when transportation is by truck only. Truck delivery accounts for approximately
84% of our total aggregates shipments. Additionally, sales yards and other distribution facilities
located on waterways and rail lines allow us to reach markets that do not have locally available
sources of aggregates. We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the
United States. Long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

Zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries
or to develop new quarries in some markets. Although we cannot predict what governmental policies
will be adopted in the future that might affect our industry, we believe that future zoning and
permitting costs will not have a materially adverse effect on our business. However, land use
restrictions in some markets could make zoning and permitting more difficult. Any such
restrictions, while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas, could also enhance the value
of our reserves at existing locations.



The customers for each of our reporting segments and the methods of distribution to such customers
are detailed in the table under Item 1 “Business” of this report. No material part of our business
is dependent upon one or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on
our business. In 2008, our top five customers accounted for 3.8% of our total revenues (excluding
internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our total revenues. Our
products are sold principally to private industry and not directly to governmental entities.
Although historically over 40% of our sales have on average gone into publicly funded construction,
such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made
directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although
reductions in state and federal funding of publicly funded construction can curtail construction
spending, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts as a result of state or federal government elections.

Research and Development Costs

We conduct research and development and technical service activities at our facility in Birmingham,
Alabama. In general, our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more
efficient uses of our products. We spent approximately $1,546,000 in 2008, $1,617,000 in 2007 and
$1,704,000 in 2006 on such activities.

Environmental Costs and Governmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
environment and to health and safety, including noise, water discharge, air quality, dust control,
zoning and permitting. We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
in 2009 and 2010 will be approximately $10,131,000 and $17,467,000, respectively.

Frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our
former mining sites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our
financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such
obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased
site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value,
we estimate the cost of a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, adjusted for
inflation and risk and including a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are
reviewed at least annually. See Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for
use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected
cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated
reclamation liability.

Patents and Trademarks

As of February 25, 2009, we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents,
trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.

Other Information Regarding Vulcan

Our principal sources of energy are electricity, diesel fuel, natural gas and coal. We do not
anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for our operation of any of our
reporting segments.

As of January 1, 2009, we employed 9,320 people, a reduction of 1,202 from January 1, 2008. Of
these employees, 927 are represented by labor unions. We do not anticipate any significant issues
with such unions in 2009.

We do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating
and understanding our business.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the following
risks, together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report,
before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. If any of these
risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the trading prices of our common stock could
decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.

Risks and Uncertainties Related to the Florida Rock Merger

We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Florida Rock merger

— The Florida Rock
merger involves the integration of two companies that previously had operated independently, each
with its own business, customers, employees, culture and systems. To realize the anticipated
benefits from the mergers, we must successfully combine the businesses of Vulcan and Florida Rock
in a manner that permits, among other things, earnings growth and cost savings. In addition, we
must achieve these savings without adversely affecting revenues. If we are not able to successfully
achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully or at
all or may take longer to realize than expected.

Our incurrence of additional debt to finance a portion of the Florida Rock merger significantly
increased our interest expense, financial leverage and debt service requirements

— We have incurred
considerable short-term and long-term debt to finance the Florida Rock merger. Incurrence of this
debt significantly increased our leverage and caused a downgrade in our credit rating. There may be
circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this debt could adversely
affect our cash flows and operating results.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments. If we fail to
comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness)
could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under our debt instruments may
also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness
will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing
economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.

Risks and Uncertainties Related to Other Aspects of Our Business

Construction, both commercial and residential, is dependent upon the overall U.S. economy which
remains weak and could weaken further

— Commercial and residential construction levels generally
move with economic cycles; when the economy is strong, construction levels rise, and when the
economy is weak, construction levels fall. The overall U.S. economy has been hurt by the changes in
the financial services sector, including failures of several
large financial institutions, significant merger and acquisition activity within that industry, and
the resulting lack of credit



availability. The commercial construction market declined in 2008,
due mostly to disruptions in credit availability and was felt most significantly starting in
September 2008. Also, continued weakness in the residential construction market negatively affected
the commercial construction market. The residential construction market further softened in 2008 as
a result of the housing market downturn. The overall weakness in the economy and the crisis in the
credit markets could cause commercial and residential construction to remain at low levels or
weaken further.

The collapse of the subprime mortgage market and, in turn, the housing market could continue to
negatively affect demand for our products

— In most of our markets, particularly Florida and
California, sales volumes have been negatively impacted by the collapse of the subprime mortgage
market and a significant decline in residential construction. Our sales volumes and earnings could
continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until these
slowdowns in residential construction improve.

A decline in public sector construction and reductions in governmental funding could adversely
affect our operations and results

— In 2008, 45% of our sales volume of construction aggregates was
made to contractors on publicly funded construction. If, as a result of a loss of funding or a
significant reduction in state or federal budgets, spending on publicly funded construction were to
be reduced significantly, our earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected.

Difficult and volatile conditions in the credit markets could affect our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows

— The current credit environment has negatively affected the
U.S. economy and demand for our products. Commercial and residential construction could continue to
decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic
slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations of capital projects. State and federal budget
issues may negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending unless
the economic stimulus plan provides the requisite funding.

A recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on
our accounts receivable from our customers. We have experienced a delay in payment from some of our
customers during this economic downturn.

The current credit environment has limited our ability to issue commercial
paper. Additional financing or refinancing might not be available and, if available, may
not be at economically favorable terms. Interest rates on new issuances of long-term public debt in
the market have increased, reflecting higher credit and risk premiums. There is no guarantee we
will be able to access the capital markets at economical interest rates, which could
negatively affect our business.

We may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions, if they
arise, or to refinance our outstanding debt. We are also exposed to risks from tightening credit
markets, through the interest payable on our outstanding short-term debt and the interest cost on
our commercial paper, to the extent it is available to us. While it
is the objective of
management to maintain our credit ratings at investment grade levels, we cannot be assured these
ratings will remain at those levels. While management believes we
will continue to have adequate credit
available to meet our needs, there can be no assurance of such credit availability.

Weather can materially affect our quarterly results

— Almost all of our products are used in
the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are
located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our
products and affects our customers’ short-term demand since their work also can be hampered by
weather. Therefore, our results can be negatively affected by inclement weather.

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry

— The construction aggregates
industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our
markets. However, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies. This
results in intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. Significant competition
could lead to lower prices, lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets, negatively
affecting our earnings and cash flows.



Our long-term success is dependent upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in
strategically located areas

— Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult
to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly
surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess
commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for
our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites. New quarry sites often take a
number of years to develop, so our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of
actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is
increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance.
Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future
areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure
operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based
resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation

— In
our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel
fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these
resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract
separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should
our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors
interrupting their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could
materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our
profitability.

We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could
affect our future financial results

— As discussed more fully in “Critical Accounting Policies”
under Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” below, we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment;
impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill; reclamation costs; pension and other
postretirement benefits; environmental compliance; claims and litigation including self-insurance;
and income taxes. Although we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to
enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates, these assumptions and
estimates could change significantly in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and
other contingencies with certainty

— We are involved in several class action and complex litigation
proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals business.
Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related
to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves
when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment
of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a
particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment
and estimates of a loss contingency. Furthermore, unfavorable results in one or more of these
actions could result in an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. For a description of our current legal proceedings see Note 12 “Other
Commitments and Contingencies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

The costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years.
Continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings

— The costs of providing
pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several
years. We have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase. However, if these costs
continue to rise, this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.

Our industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore,
our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume

— Due to the high levels of fixed capital
required for the extraction and production of construction aggregates, profitability as measured in
absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales (“margins”) can be greatly impacted due to
changes in volume.



Our products generally must be transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, usually by third party
providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could
materially affect our operations and earnings

— Our products are distributed either by truck to
local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets. Costs of transporting our
products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service
interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally,
inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact
our distribution network.

Our future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly
in sales and operations

— A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to
attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel,
particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the
available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions,
the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer
competitive compensation and benefit packages.

Changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use, environmental
and other areas of the law impact our business

— Our operations expose us to the risk of material
environmental liabilities. Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws
and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance
efforts there is the inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business, especially from
an environmental standpoint. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our
operations and profitability. Our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits,
which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance expenditures to comply with
zoning and environmental laws and regulations. Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent
interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating
hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede our opening
new or expanding existing plants or facilities.

Our future growth is dependent in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and
successfully integrating them with our existing operations

— The expansion of our business is
dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own aggregates reserves. Our
constrained credit and financing opportunities make it more difficult to capitalize on potential
acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future
results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with
our existing operations.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.



Item 2. Properties

We have 222 sites at which we engage in the extraction of stone, sand and gravel. Of these, 219 are
located in the United States, one in Mexico, one in the Bahamas and one in Canada. We also have 89
sales yards used for the distribution of stone, sand and gravel not located at the extraction
facilities. The following map shows the locations of our stone and sand and gravel production
facilities and our aggregates distribution yards as of December 31, 2008.

Our current estimate of 13.3 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects an
increase of 0.6 billion tons from the estimate at the end of 2007. We believe that the quantities
of proven and probable reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average
life of approximately 51.7 years at present operating levels. In calculating the average life of
51.7 years, we assumed an annual aggregates production rate of 257 million tons. See footnote 1 to
the following table for a description of our method employed for estimating the life of reserves.
This table presents, by regional division, the estimated aggregates reserve life and the percentage
of aggregates reserves by rock type.

Estimated years of life of aggregates reserves are based on the average annual rate of production of each
regional division for the most recent three-year period, except that if reserves are acquired or if
production has been reactivated during that period, the estimated years of life are based on the annual
rate of production from the date of such acquisition or reactivation. Revisions may be necessitated by such
occurrences as changes in zoning laws governing facility properties, changes in aggregates specifications
required by major customers and passage of government regulations applicable to aggregates operations.
Estimates also are revised when and if additional geological evidence indicates that a revision is
necessary. For 2008, the total three-year average annual rate of production was 257 million tons, as
described above. These production rates include Florida Rock’s production for periods prior to the November
16, 2007 acquisition by Vulcan.

The foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel of suitable quality
for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers, recognizing
reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone
excavation, subject to permit restrictions.

Of the 222 permanent reserve-supplied aggregates production facilities which we operate, 86
(representing 49% of total reserves) are located on owned land, 45 (representing 21% of total
reserves) are on land owned in part and leased in part, and 91 (representing 30% of total reserves)
are on leased land. While some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted,
generally our leases have definite expiration dates, which range from 2009 to 2159. Most of our
leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion.

The following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates
facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves. None of our aggregates
facilities contributes more than 5% to our net sales.

Our Cement segment operates two quarries for its raw materials: the Newberry, Florida quarry, which
has limestone reserves of 194.7 million tons, or 75 years of life at expected future production
rates; and the Brooksville, Florida quarry, which has calcium carbonate reserves of 6.9 million
tons, or 9 years of life based on expected production rates and a lease termination.



Other Properties

We also operate 124 concrete plants, 41 asphalt mix plants, 4 cement facilities and 1 calcium plant
as noted in the following map.

Our headquarters are located in an office complex in Birmingham, Alabama. The office space is
leased through December 31, 2013, with two five-year renewal periods, and consists of approximately
184,125 square feet. The annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is $3.4 million.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety
and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise
abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in
safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to
comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.



We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to
determine with precision the outcome of, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits,
especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.

See Note 12 “Other Commitments and Contingencies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” below for a discussion of our material legal proceedings.

In addition to our legal proceedings listed in Note 12, we have one environmental penalty in excess
of $100,000. During November 2008, we received an Administrative Civil Liability complaint from the
California Bay Area Regional Water Quality Control Board, related to a discharge of water and
sediment that occurred at our Pleasanton, California aggregates facility in April 2007. The
complaint alleged that the discharge violated provisions of the California Water Code and the
facility’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. We paid a civil penalty
of $190,000 on February 5, 2009, in full settlement of this matter.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matter was submitted to our security holders through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to drive the U.S. economy. We are
the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates — primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel
— a major producer of asphalt mix and concrete and a leading producer of cement in Florida.

Segments

Our four operating segments are organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, asphalt
mix, concrete and cement. For reporting purposes, we have combined our Asphalt mix and Concrete
segments into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses
exhibit similar economic characteristics, product processes, types and classes of customer, methods
of distribution and regulatory environments. Management reviews earnings for the product line
reporting units principally at the gross profit level.

Our Aggregates segment mines, processes, distributes and sells crushed stone, sand and gravel. Our
Asphalt mix and Concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix, ready-mixed concrete, concrete
block, prestressed concrete
beams



and precast concrete, and sells other building materials. Our Cement segment mines limestone
feedstock and produces and sells Portland cement and masonry cement. It also imports, grinds,
blends and sells cement and slag, and produces and sells calcium products.

Products

We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product — aggregates — is consumed in
virtually all types of publicly and privately funded construction. During 2008, we shipped 204.3
million tons into 23 states, the District of Columbia, the Bahamas,
Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile and Mexico from 331 aggregates
production facilities and sales yards. Our ten largest states, measured by our aggregates
shipments, accounted for 82% of our total aggregates shipments. Reserves largely determine the
ongoing viability of an aggregates business. Our current estimate of 13.3 billion tons of zoned and
permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase of 5.0 billion tons since the end of 1998.
We believe that these reserves are sufficient to last, on average, 51.7 years at current annual
production rates. While aggregates are our primary business, we believe vertical integration
between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and concrete, can be managed
effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns. As such, we evaluate the
structural characteristics of individual markets to determine the appropriateness of an
aggregates-only or vertical integration strategy.

For a discussion of End Markets, Competition and Customers, and Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of
Our Business, see Item 1 Business above.

Other

On November 16, 2007, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Florida Rock Industries,
Inc. (Florida Rock), a leading producer of construction aggregates, cement, concrete and concrete
products in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states, in exchange for cash and stock of
approximately $4.2 billion based on the closing price of Vulcan common stock on November 15, 2007.
The acquisition further diversified the geographic scope of Vulcan’s operations, expanding our
presence in attractive Florida markets and in other high-growth southeastern and mid-Atlantic
states, and adding approximately 1.6 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves and
0.1 billion tons of proven and probable cement and calcium carbonate reserves in many markets where
reserves are increasingly scarce.

In June 2005, we sold our Chemicals business as presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements and, accordingly, its results are reported as discontinued operations in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In the discussion that follows, continuing operations consist of our Construction Materials
business, which is organized into three reportable segments: Aggregates; Asphalt mix and Concrete;
and Cement. The results of operations discussed below include Florida Rock for the periods from
November 16, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008.
Discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business, are discussed separately.
In the comparative analysis, segment revenue at the product line level includes intersegment sales.
Net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost. This
presentation is consistent with the basis on which management reviews results of operations.

Results of Operations

2008 versus 2007

The financial and economic turmoil in the U.S. is unprecedented and the external factors affecting
the construction industry continue to present unique challenges for our business. Aggregates demand
and our shipments have declined for three consecutive years. Our legacy aggregates shipments in
2008 were down 30% from the peak level achieved in 2005. Throughout 2008, we focused aggressively
on controlling costs while realizing higher pricing for our products reflecting their value in the
attractive markets we serve. We reduced our operating costs by limiting operating hours,
streamlining our work force, and focusing on production efficiencies in the face of a sharp decline
in demand for our products. As a result of these actions, the cash earnings per ton of aggregates
in our legacy operations increased over 50% from the 2005 level, which was a year of peak demand
for aggregates. The cash earnings generated on each ton of aggregates sold in 2008 was higher than
in any other period in our history. The



increased level of unit profitability supports our optimism about the earnings potential of our
business when demand begins to recover.

Net sales for 2008 of $3.5 billion reflected an increase of 12% from the prior year. This increase
resulted from the inclusion of the former Florida Rock operations for the full year. Volumes were
adversely affected by the continuing sharp downturn in construction activity. Pricing for our
products remained strong and helped offset the earnings effects of lower volumes, higher
energy-related costs, increased interest expense, as well as higher noncash charges for
depreciation, depletion and amortization. The unit cost for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt
increased 36% and 69%, respectively, from 2007 in our legacy operations. Net loss per diluted share
was $0.04 in 2008 compared with net earnings of $4.54 per diluted share in 2007. The 2008 results
include an estimated $227.6 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, after tax goodwill impairment
charge referable to our Cement segment in Florida. The 2008 results also include net earnings per
diluted share of $0.34 referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval
by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. Results in 2007 include net earnings
per diluted share of $0.24 referable to the sale of real estate in California, net of the related
incentives. Additionally, the higher energy-related costs lowered earnings per diluted share $0.86
compared with 2007.

Aggregates segment revenues decreased $41.4 million to $2,406.8 million compared with 2007, as the
effect of lower volumes from legacy operations more than offset the effect of improved pricing and
the inclusion of a full year of sales from the former Florida Rock aggregates operations. Compared
with 2007, total aggregates shipments declined 12% while the average selling price increased 7%.
Most of our geographic markets reported double-digit percentage declines in aggregates volumes
except for markets in Texas and along the Central Gulf Coast. Gross profit for the Aggregates
segment of $657.6 million declined 21% from 2007 as the earnings effects from the decline in legacy
Vulcan shipments and sharply higher unit cost for diesel fuel more than offset the improvement in
aggregates pricing and the inclusion of earnings from the former Florida Rock operations.

Asphalt mix and Concrete segment revenues increased $435.3 million to $1,201.2 million compared
with 2007. Shipments of asphalt mix declined 9% in 2008 while concrete shipments increased
significantly due to inclusion of a full year of sales from the former Florida Rock concrete
operations. Asphalt mix prices increased 15% from 2007 while the unit cost of liquid asphalt rose
69%. Asphalt mix earnings decreased due principally to higher costs for liquid asphalt. Compared
with 2007, gross profit for the Asphalt mix and Concrete segment decreased 39% to $74.4 million in
2008.

Revenues and gross profit for the Cement segment were $106.5 million and $17.7 million,
respectively. The Cement segment was acquired in November 2007 as part of the Florida Rock
acquisition, and therefore, no comparable revenues or earnings were reported for the first 10
months of 2007.

Selling, administrative and general expenses increased $53.0 million from 2007. This increase was
primarily attributable to including a full year of expenses related to the former Florida Rock
businesses, $10.5 million of expense related to the fair market value of donated property and $6.7
million related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related
consolidation of certain administrative support functions.

During 2008, we recorded an estimated $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to
our cement operations in Florida, representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting
unit. There were no comparable charges in 2007.

During 2008, we recorded a $73.8 million pretax gain referable to the sale of quarry sites divested
as a condition for approval by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. During
2007, we recorded a $43.8 million pretax gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of real estate
in California.

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $75.1 million, a decrease of $592.4
million from the prior year. In addition to the items noted above, higher interest expense
contributed to this decrease in earnings. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased
$128.1 million due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of Florida Rock.

Earnings (loss) from continuing operations decreased to ($0.02) per diluted share in 2008 from
$4.66 per diluted share in 2007. The goodwill impairment charge
accounted for $2.07 per diluted share of the decline.

2007 versus 2006

Consolidated net sales increased 2% from the prior year to a record $3.1 billion. Continued strong
growth in aggregates pricing during 2007 contributed to an increase in operating earnings
year-over-year despite lower sales volumes across all principal product lines. The pricing momentum
achieved in 2005 and 2006 continued in 2007, reflecting an environment that recognizes the high
cost of replacing aggregates reserves in high growth metropolitan markets.

Aggregates segment revenues were $2,448.2 million in 2007, an increase of 2% from $2,405.5 in the
prior year. Excluding the effects of the Florida Rock acquisition, revenues for Vulcan’s legacy
Aggregates segment declined slightly as lower shipments were substantially offset by a 13% increase
in average selling prices. Aggregates shipments during 2007 decreased approximately 9% from 2006
levels, primarily as a result of lower demand in the residential construction market. The impact of
residential construction activity on shipments was partially offset by increased levels of highway
construction and nonresidential building construction. Gross profit for the Aggregates segment
increased $9.7 million, or 1%, over 2006. Unit costs for aggregates produced at legacy Vulcan
operations increased in 2007 due principally to the effects of higher depreciation expense
referable to recently completed capital projects coupled with a 10% reduction in production
volumes. Additionally, unit costs for energy, such as diesel fuel and electric power, increased by
approximately 7%. Higher costs for diesel fuel lowered gross profit from legacy Vulcan aggregates
operations approximately $12 million.

Revenues for the Asphalt mix and Concrete segment increased slightly to $765.9 million in 2007 as
compared to $760.9 million in 2006. Excluding the effects of the Florida Rock acquisition, revenues
for Vulcan’s legacy Asphalt mix and Concrete segment decreased by $60.5 million, or 8%. Revenues
for asphalt mix improved due to higher pricing, which more than offset a 9% decline in volumes.
Concrete pricing improved 7%, but was more than offset by a 30% decline in volumes. Gross profit
for the Asphalt mix and Concrete segment was mixed, with asphalt mix improving and concrete
declining. Higher pricing for asphalt mix more than offset the lower volumes and higher prices for
aggregates supplied internally. Unit costs for liquid asphalt remained at high levels in 2007 with
little change when compared with the prior year. Higher pricing for concrete was more than offset
by lower volumes and higher raw material costs, including aggregates supplied internally.

Revenues and gross profit for the Cement segment, all of which was acquired in the Florida Rock
transaction, were immaterial to 2007 results of operations.

Operating earnings improved to $714.4 million, a 2.8% increase over 2006. The increase in operating
earnings was due to the aforementioned higher pricing for each of our principal products and a
$43.8 million gain on sale of real estate in California during the first quarter of 2007. Prior
year results include a $24.8 million gain referable to the



sale of contractual rights to mine a
quarry in Atlanta, Georgia. These favorable contributions to operating earnings
more than offset the effects of lower production levels, an increase in energy costs and Florida
Rock transaction and integration related costs.

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $667.5 million, a decrease of $36.0
million from the prior year. The 2006 earnings include a pretax gain of $28.7 million related to
the increase in the carrying value of the contingent ECU (electrochemical unit) earn-out received
in connection with the sale of our Chemicals business. The 2007 corresponding pretax gain from the
ECU earn-out was $1.9 million. An increase of $21.9 million in interest expense also contributed to
the decline in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes.

$


Earnings from continuing operations decreased to $4.66 per diluted share from $4.81 per diluted
share in 2006. Earnings per share in 2007 include the effects of the Florida Rock acquisition,
including operating results, interest expense associated with the financing of the transaction,
additional shares issued as part of the transaction, one-time expenses associated with executing
the transaction and integrating the businesses, and depreciation associated with the write-up of
assets to fair value in accordance with purchase accounting. Specifically, 2007 diluted earnings
per share include approximately $0.13 per share due to one-time transaction related items, $0.12
per share related to higher interest expense attributable to the additional debt incurred to fund
the transaction, and $0.07 per share due to the effect of additional shares issued as purchase
consideration in the transaction.

Selling, Administrative and General

Selling, administrative and general expenses were $342.6 million in 2008 as compared with $289.6
million in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the following: including a
full year of expenses related to the former Florida Rock businesses; $10.5 million of expense
related to the fair market value of donated property (a partially offsetting amount is recorded in
gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses, net as noted below); and $6.7 million
related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related consolidation
of certain administrative support functions. Excluding the effects of the aforementioned items,
selling, administrative and general expenses decreased approximately $30.0 million or 11% compared
with the prior year, primarily as a result of lower performance-based compensation. Selling,
administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.9% in 2008, up from the
prior year’s 9.4%. In 2007, selling, administrative and general expenses increased $25.3 million or
9.6% from the 2006 level. This increase was partially attributable to selling, administrative and
general expenses associated with the newly acquired Florida Rock operations as well as transaction
and integration related costs. Excluding the effects of Florida Rock, during 2007 selling,
administrative and general expenses increased approximately 5% over the 2006 level.

Goodwill Impairment

During 2008, we recorded an estimated $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to
our Cement segment in Florida, representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting
unit. These operations were acquired as part of the Florida Rock transaction in November 2007.
There were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2007 and 2006. For additional details regarding
this impairment, see the Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment Critical Accounting Policy below.



Gain on Sale of Property, Plant & Equipment and Businesses, Net

During 2008, we recorded gains on the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses of $94.2
million, an increase of $35.5 million from the prior year. Included in the 2008 gains was the
aforementioned $73.8 million pretax gain referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a
condition for approval by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. Also included
was $10.4 million of gain related to the fair market value of donated property. During 2007, we
recorded gains on the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses of $58.7 million, an
increase of $53.1 million from 2006. Included in the 2007 gains was a $43.8 million pretax gain,
net of transaction costs, on the sale of real estate in California. As none of these asset sales
met the definition of a “component of an entity” as defined in SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets” (FAS 144), the gains were reported in continuing
operations.

Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net

Other operating income, net of other operating expense, increased $5.9 million from the 2007 level
to a net income of $0.4 million in 2008. Other operating expense, net of other operating income,
increased $27.4 million from the 2006 level to a net expense of $5.5 million in 2007. The variance
from 2006 resulted primarily from a $24.8 million pretax gain in 2006 from the sale of contractual
rights to mine the Bellwood quarry in Atlanta, Georgia with no similar gain in 2007.

Other Income (Expense), Net

In 2008, other expense of $4.4 million declined $0.9 million from 2007. In 2007, other expense was
$5.3 million compared to other income of $28.5 million in 2006. Gains attributable to increases in
the carrying value of the ECU earn-out amounted to $1.9 million during 2007 compared with $28.7
million in 2006.

Interest Income

Interest income was $3.1 million in 2008 compared with $6.6 million in 2007. This decrease in
interest income resulted primarily from lower average cash and cash equivalents balances resulting
primarily from the financing requirements of the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition. Interest
income in 2007 increased $0.5 million from the 2006 level.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $172.8 million in 2008 compared with the 2007 amount of $48.2 million. This
increase in interest expense was due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of Florida
Rock. Excluding capitalized interest credits, gross interest expense for 2008 was $187.1 million
compared with $53.3 million in 2007 and $31.3 million in 2006. Interest expense was $48.2 million
in 2007 compared with the 2006 amount of $26.3 million. The $21.9 million increase was due
primarily to approximately $3.2 billion in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the consideration
paid to acquire Florida Rock.

Income Taxes

Our 2008 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 102.2%, up 71.6 percentage points from
30.6% in 2007. This increase principally reflected the unfavorable impact of the goodwill
impairment charge. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, our 2008 effective tax
rate for continuing operations was 31.1%, up 0.5 percentage points from 2007. The 2007 rate for
continuing operations was down 1.1 percentage points from the 2006 rate of 31.7%. This decrease
principally reflected a reduction in state income taxes and an increase in the tax benefit from
contributions.

Discontinued Operations

In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business, known as Vulcan Chemicals,
to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation. The purchaser also assumed
certain liabilities related to the Chemicals business, including the obligation to monitor and
remediate all releases of hazardous materials at or from the Wichita, Geismar and Port Edwards
plant facilities. The decision to sell the Chemicals business was based on our desire to focus our
resources on the Construction Materials business. Financial results referable to our Chemicals
business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

The transaction, which was structured as a sale of assets, involved initial cash proceeds,
contingent future proceeds under two earn-out provisions and the transfer of certain liabilities.
At the closing date, the fair value of the



consideration received in connection with the sale of the Chemicals business, including anticipated
cash flows from the two earn-out agreements, was expected to exceed the net carrying value of the
assets and liabilities sold. However, pursuant to SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” since
the proceeds under the earn-out agreements were contingent in nature, no gain was recognized on the
Chemicals sale and the value recorded at the June 7, 2005 closing date referable to these two
earn-outs was limited to $128.2 million. Furthermore, under SAB Topic 5:Z:5, upward adjustments to
the fair value of the ECU earn-out subsequent to closing, which totaled $51.3 million, were
recorded in continuing operations, and therefore did not contribute to the gain or loss on the sale
of the Chemicals business. Ultimately, gain or loss on disposal will be recognized to the extent
future cash receipts under the 5CP (hydrochlorocarbon product HCC-240fa) earn-out related to the
remaining performance period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012 exceed or fall
short of its $10.8 million December 31, 2008 carrying amount.

Pretax operating results from discontinued operations were a loss of $4.1 million in 2008 compared
with a loss of $19.3 million in 2007. These operating losses reflect charges related to general and
product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs
associated with our former Chemicals businesses. For additional information regarding discontinued
operations, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Changes

FAS 157

— On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (FAS 157) with
respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of FAS 157 for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Staff Position No. FAS 157-2 (FSP FAS 157-2). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of FAS
157 for financial assets and liabilities had no effect on our results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. Additionally, its adoption resulted in no material changes in our valuation
methodologies, techniques or assumptions for such assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements under the caption Fair Value Measurements for disclosures related
to financial assets and liabilities pursuant to the requirements of FAS 157.

FAS 158

— On January 1, 2008, we adopted the measurement date provision of SFAS No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (FAS 158). In addition to the recognition provisions
(which we adopted December 31, 2006), FAS 158 requires an employer to measure the plan assets and
benefit obligations as of the date of its year-end balance sheet. This requirement was effective
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Upon adopting the measurement date provision, we
remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations as of January 1, 2008, pursuant to the transition
requirements of FAS 158. The transition adjustment resulted in an increase to noncurrent assets of
$15.0 million, an increase to noncurrent liabilities of $2.2 million, an increase to deferred tax
liabilities of $5.1 million, a decrease to retained earnings of $1.3 million and an increase to
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $9.0 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe we have sufficient financial resources, including cash provided by operating activities,
unused bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets, to fund business requirements in the
future, including debt service obligations, cash contractual obligations, capital expenditures and
dividend payments.

In February 2009, we issued $400 million of long-term debt (as noted in Note 22 to the consolidated
financial statements) and used the proceeds to reduce short-term bank
borrowings, thereby freeing up
a like amount of liquidity under our bank lines of credit. Debt reduction and achieving target debt
ratios remain a priority use of cash flows. We expect to reduce total debt by $200 million during
2009, excluding any earnings effect from the economic stimulus plan. For the full year 2009, we
expect capital spending, excluding acquisitions, to approximate $200 million, down sharply from the
$354.2 million spent in 2008.



Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities (including discontinued operations) decreased $272.9
million to $435.2 million during 2008 as compared with a total of $708.1 million in 2007. Net
earnings adjusted for noncash expenses related to goodwill impairment and depreciation, depletion,
accretion and amortization accounted for $84.8 million of the decrease. In addition, certain assets
were required to be disposed of as a condition to the acquisition of Florida Rock (Note 20 to the
consolidated financial statements). The reclassification of gains resulting from these dispositions
and other net gains on sale of property, plant & equipment contributed an additional $35.6 million
to the year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities as the associated cash
received is presented as a component of investing activities. Reductions in trade payables and
other accruals accounted for an additional $102.6 million decrease in cash provided by operating
activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities (including discontinued operations) totaled $708.1
million in 2007, an increase of $128.8 million or 22% as compared with 2006. Net earnings adjusted
for noncash expenses related to depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization increased $25.8
million when compared with the prior year. Comparative changes in working capital and other assets
and liabilities contributed approximately $129.0 million to the increase in net cash provided by
operating activities, primarily resulting from decreases in accounts receivable and income tax
liabilities. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to operating cash flows was a
reclassification to investing activities of $28.3 million related to net gains on sales of
property, plant & equipment and contractual rights.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $189.0 million in 2008 compared with $3,654.3
million in 2007. The $3,465.3 million decrease was largely attributable to the acquisition of
Florida Rock in 2007, which required cash payments of $3,239.0 million, net of cash acquired and
including Vulcan’s direct transaction costs. A reduction in capital spending of $130.1 million from
the prior year reflects our focus on utilizing cash to reduce debt. Proceeds from the sale of
businesses required to be divested as part of the Florida Rock acquisition contributed to a $195.2
million increase in proceeds from the sale of businesses, partially offset by a $63.4 million
decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant & equipment. Additionally, $36.7 million in
assets held in money market and other money funds were reclassified from cash equivalents to
medium-term investments during 2008, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled $270.8 million in 2008, as compared with net cash
provided by financing activities during 2007 of $2,925.8 million. The $3,196.6 million decrease in
cash generated from financing activities was due primarily to a $2,901.6 million change in net
short-term borrowing activity, an increase in payments of short-term debt and current maturities of
$46.8 million, and a $271.0 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net
of discounts and debt issuance costs. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2008 of
$949.1 million were used to pay down short-term borrowings drawn during 2007 to fund the Florida
Rock acquisition (Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Partially offsetting these
decreases in cash from financing activities were cash proceeds of $55.1 million from the issuance
of common stock, as discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Our policy is to pay out a reasonable share of net cash provided by operating activities as
dividends, consistent on average with the payout record of past years, while maintaining debt
ratios within what we believe to be prudent and generally acceptable limits.

Working Capital

Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, totaled ($769.2) million at
December 31, 2008, an increase of $601.8 million from the ($1,371.0) million level at December 31,
2007. The increase in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease of $1,009.0 million in
short-term borrowings partially offset by an increase in current maturities of $276.5 million.
Weakness in demand for our products resulted in a $64.9 million year-over-year decrease in net
accounts and notes receivable, offset by a related decrease in trade payables and accruals of $72.4
million. As of December 31, 2008, we have $1,672.5 million in bank lines of credit, of which
$1,082.5 million was drawn.

Working capital totaled ($1,371.0) million at December 31, 2007, a decrease of $1,614.7 million
from the $243.7 million level at December 31, 2006. The 2007 decrease resulted primarily from the
use of cash and short-term



borrowings to fund the acquisition of Florida Rock. Excluding the effects of the change in
short-term borrowings, working capital increased $278.0 million, primarily due to inventory and
accounts receivable, offset in part by current trade payables and accrued liabilities, acquired in
the Florida Rock transaction.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures, which exclude business acquisitions, totaled $354.2 million in 2008, down
$126.3 million from the 2007 level of $480.5 million. During 2008, we completed three major
aggregates plant rebuilds and continued the multi-year expansion project at our Newberry Cement
plant. As explained in the Financial Terminology, we classify our capital expenditures into three
categories based on the predominant purpose of the project. In 2008, profit-adding projects
accounted for $230.1 million or 65% of the 2008 spending.

Commitments for capital expenditures were $25.0 million at December 31, 2008. We expect to fund
these commitments using available cash, internally generated cash flow or additional borrowings.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

In 2008, the total purchase price (cash and stock consideration paid) of acquisitions amounted to
$152.1 million, down significantly from the prior year, which included $4,678.4 million related to
the Florida Rock acquisition (the largest in our history).

As a result of the 2007 Florida Rock acquisition, we entered into a Final Judgment with the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that required us to divest nine Florida
Rock and Legacy Vulcan sites. We completed these divestitures in 2008 resulting in the acquisition
of several sites through exchanges with various entities, as follows. In a transaction with Luck
Stone Corporation, we acquired two aggregates production facilities in Virginia and cash in
exchange for two Florida Rock sites in Virginia, an aggregates production facility and a
distribution yard. In a transaction with Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (Martin Marietta), we
received cash and acquired an aggregates production facility near Sacramento, California, real property with proven
and permitted reserves adjacent to one of our aggregates production facilities in San Antonio,
Texas, and fee ownership of property at one of our aggregates production facilities in North
Carolina that we had previously leased from Martin Marietta. In return, we divested four aggregates
production facilities and a greenfield (undeveloped) aggregates site located in Georgia, and an
aggregates production facility located in Tennessee. Two of the divested sites included in the
transaction with Martin Marietta were owned by Vulcan prior to our acquisition of Florida Rock.
Accordingly, during 2008, we recognized a pretax gain of $73.8 million on the sale of these assets.
In a separate transaction, we sold our interest in an aggregates production facility in Georgia to
The Concrete Company, which had been the joint venture partner with Florida Rock in this operation.

In addition to the 2008 acquisitions obtained in the aforementioned exchanges, other acquisitions
completed during 2008 included four aggregates production facilities, one asphalt mix plant, a
recycling facility and vacant land located in California, an aggregates production facility in
Illinois and our former joint venture partner’s interest in an aggregates production facility in
Tennessee. These acquisitions cost approximately $108.4 million (total cash and stock consideration
paid) including acquisition costs and net of acquired cash.

The 2007 acquisitions included the Florida Rock acquisition, an aggregates production facility in
Illinois and an aggregates production facility in North Carolina. In addition to these
acquisitions, during 2007, we acquired an aggregates production facility in Alabama in exchange for
two aggregates production facilities in Illinois. The Florida Rock acquisition (exclusive of
divestitures required pursuant to an agreement with the Department of Justice) consisted of 29
aggregates production facilities, 15 aggregates sales yards, 108 concrete plants, 1 cement plant, 1
calcium products plant and 3 cement grinding facilities located in the southeastern and
mid-Atlantic states. Proven and probable reserves (aggregates, calcium products and cement)
acquired in the Florida Rock transaction amounted to approximately 1.7 billion tons.

We were a net short-term borrower throughout 2008 and ended the year in a net short-term borrowed
position of $1,042.5 million. In 2008, total short-term borrowings reached a peak of $2,192.7
million and amounted to $1,082.5 million at year end. Throughout 2007, we were a net short-term
borrower and ended the year in a net short-term borrowed position of $2,058.5 million. In 2007,
total short-term borrowings reached a peak of $3,314.9 million and amounted to $2,091.5 million at
year end. During most of 2006, we were a net short-term borrower and ended the year in a net
short-term borrowed position of $148.5 million. In 2006, total short-term borrowings reached a peak
of $236.8 million and amounted to $198.9 million at year end.

We utilize our bank lines of credit as liquidity back-up for outstanding commercial paper or draw
on the bank lines to access London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based short-term loans to fund
our borrowing requirements. Periodically, we issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes,
including working capital requirements. We plan to continue this practice from time to time as
circumstances warrant.

Our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial
paper. Unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $1,672.5 million were maintained at the end of 2008,
of which $7.5 million expired January 28, 2009, $165.0 million expires November 16, 2009, and
$1,500.0 million expires November 16, 2012. As of December 31, 2008, $1,082.5 million of the lines
of credit was drawn. Interest rates are determined at the time of borrowing based on current market
conditions.

As of December 31, 2008, our commercial paper was rated A-2 and P-2 by Standard & Poor’s and
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), respectively. Both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have
assigned a negative outlook to our short-term debt ratings.

Scheduled debt payments during 2008 included $33.0 million in December to retire a private
placement note, $15.0 million in December representing the first quarterly payment under the 3-year
floating rate loan issued in June and payments under various miscellaneous notes that either
matured at various dates or required monthly payments. A note in the amount of $1.3 million
previously scheduled to be retired in 2008 was extended until May 2009. Scheduled debt payments
during 2007 were composed of miscellaneous notes that matured at various dates.

Maturity dates for our $311.7 million of current maturities as of December 31, 2008 are as follows:
March 2009 — $15.0 million, April 2009 — $250.0 million, May 2009 — $1.3 million, June 2009 — $15.0
million, September 2009 — $15.0 million, December 2009 — $15.0 million, and various dates for the
remaining $0.4 million. We expect to retire this debt using available cash or by issuing commercial
paper or other debt securities.

Our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions with regard to working capital or
the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock. The percentage of
consolidated debt to total capitalization (total debt as a percentage of total capital), as defined
in our bank credit facility agreements, must be less than 65%. In the future, our total debt as a
percentage of total capital will depend on specific investment and financing decisions. As a result
of our financing to fund the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition, our total debt as a percentage
of total capital increased for the two subsequent periods above. We intend to maintain an
investment grade rating and expect our operating cash flows will enable us to reduce our total debt
as a percentage of total capital to a target range of 35% to 40% within the next five years, in
line with our historical capital structure targets. We have made acquisitions from time to time and
will continue to pursue attractive investment opportunities. Such acquisitions could be funded by
using internally generated cash or issuing debt or equity securities.

During the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, long-term debt increased cumulatively by
$1,830.2 million from the $323.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2005. During the same
three-year period, shareholders’ equity, net of dividends of $541.6 million, increased by $1,389.1
million to $3,522.7 million.

During 2008, long-term debt increased by $623.8 million to $2,153.6 million, compared with a net
increase of $1,207.8 million in 2007. Both the 2008 and 2007 increases relate primarily to debt
issuances to fund the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock. The issuances noted below
effectively replace the short-term borrowings we incurred to initially fund the cash portion of the
acquisition.

In June 2008, we issued $650.0 million of long-term notes in two series (tranches), as follows:
$250.0 million of 5-year 6.30% coupon notes and $400.0 million of 10-year 7.00% coupon notes. These
notes are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 net of discounts from
par in the amounts of $0.5 million and
$0.4 million, respectively. These discounts are being amortized using the effective interest method
over the



respective lives of the notes. The effective interest rates for the 5-year and 10-year
2008 note issuances, including the effects of underwriting commissions and the settlement of the
forward starting interest rate swap agreements, are 7.47% and 7.86%, respectively.

Additionally, in June 2008 we established a $300.0 million 3-year syndicated floating rate term
loan based on a spread over LIBOR (1, 2, 3 or 6-month LIBOR options). As of December 31, 2008, the
spread was 1.5 percentage points above the selected LIBOR option. The spread is subject to increase
if our long-term credit ratings are downgraded. This loan requires quarterly principal payments of
$15.0 million starting in December 2008 and a final principal payment of $135.0 million in June
2011.

In December 2007, we issued $1,225.0 million of long-term notes in four related series (tranches),
as follows: $325.0 million of 3-year floating rate notes, $300.0 million of 5-year 5.60% coupon
notes, $350.0 million of 10-year 6.40% coupon notes and $250.0 million of 30-year 7.15% coupon
notes. Concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement
on the $325.0 million 3-year floating rate notes to convert them to a fixed interest rate of 5.25%.
These notes are presented in our financial statements net of discounts from par in the amounts of
$0.0 million, $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. These discounts are being
amortized using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the notes. The effective
interest rates for these notes, including the effects of underwriting commissions and other debt
issuance costs, the above mentioned interest rate swap agreement and the settlement of the forward
starting interest rate swap agreements, are 5.41%, 6.58%, 7.39% and 8.04% for the 3-year, 5-year,
10-year and 30-year notes, respectively.

Additionally, as a result of the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition, we assumed existing debt
as follows: $17.6 million of variable-rate tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds of which $3.6
million is secured, unsecured notes in the amount of $0.6 million and secured notes in the amount
of $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rated our public long-term debt at the BBB+
and Baa2 level, respectively. Both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have assigned a negative outlook
to our long-term debt ratings.

The above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $18.1 million
at December 31, 2008, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and

to the consolidated financial statements).

We estimate cash requirements for income taxes in 2009 to be $50.1 million, including the effect of
refunds from overpayments during 2008.

We have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not
material to our earnings. These contracts are discrete in nature, and it is unlikely that the
various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event. The
future payments under these contracts are not included in the table set forth above.

million expires November 16, 2012. As of December 31, 2008, $1,082.5 million of the lines of credit
was drawn.

Standby Letters of Credit

We provide certain third parties with irrevocable standby letters of credit in the normal course of
business. We use commercial banks to issue standby letters of credit to back our obligations to pay
or perform when required to do so



pursuant to the requirements of an underlying agreement or the provision of goods and services. The
standby letters of credit listed below are cancelable only at the option of the beneficiaries who
are authorized to draw drafts on the issuing bank up to the face amount of the standby letter of
credit in accordance with its terms. Since banks consider letters of credit as contingent
extensions of credit, we are required to pay a fee until they expire or are canceled. Substantially
all of our standby letters of credit have a one-year term and are renewable annually at the option
of the beneficiary.

Our standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table below (in
millions of dollars):

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest
entities, that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on
our results of operations, financial position, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

Common Stock

Our decisions to purchase shares of our common stock are based on valuation and price, our
liquidity and debt level, and our actual and projected cash requirements for investment projects
and regular dividends. The amount, if any, of future share purchases will be determined by
management from time to time based on various factors, including those listed above. Shares
purchased have historically been used for general corporate purposes, including distributions under
long-term incentive plans.

The number and cost of shares purchased during each of the last three years and shares held in

On November 16, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the agreement to acquire Florida Rock, all treasury
stock held immediately prior to the close of the transaction was canceled. Our Board of Directors
resolved to carry forward the existing authorization to purchase common stock. Presently, we do not
anticipate the purchase of our common stock in a material amount.

The number of shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the Board of Directors
was 3,411,416 as of December 31, 2008.

New Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. As previously noted, on
January 1, 2008, we adopted



FAS 157 with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to
defer our adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by FSP FAS
157-2.

FAS 157 applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be
measured at fair value; accordingly, it does not expand the use of fair value in any new
circumstances. Fair value under FAS 157 is defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the
assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. In support of this
principle, the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to
develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in
active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data; for example, a reporting entity’s own
data. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the
fair value hierarchy. For nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those items recognized or
disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequent basis, FSP FAS 157-2 requires companies to
adopt the provisions of FAS 157 for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 with early
adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
liabilities on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations” [FAS 141(R)], which
requires the acquirer in a business combination to measure all assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at their acquisition date fair value. FAS 141(R) applies whenever an acquirer obtains
control of one or more businesses. Additionally, the new standard requires that in a business
combination:

FAS 141(R) requires prospective application for business combinations consummated in fiscal years
beginning on or after December 15, 2008; we will adopt FAS
141(R) on January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51” (FAS 160). The standard requires all entities to report
noncontrolling interests, sometimes referred to as minority interests, in subsidiaries as equity in
the consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling interest under FAS 160 is defined as the
portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The
standard requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be
clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, but separate from
the parent’s equity. The amount of consolidated net earnings attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interest should be presented separately on the face of the consolidated statement of
earnings. When a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the
former subsidiary should be measured at fair value, and a gain or loss recognized accordingly. FAS
160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 160
on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (FAS 161). The enhanced disclosure
requirements of FAS 161 are intended to help investors better understand how and why an entity uses
derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and
hedging activities affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The
enhanced disclosures include, for example:



•

Qualitative disclosure about the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments.

•

Tabular disclosures of the fair value amounts of derivative instruments, their gains and
losses and locations within the financial statements.

•

Disclosure of any features in a derivative instrument that are credit-risk related.

FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We expect to adopt the disclosure
requirements of FAS 161 no later than our interim period ending March 31, 2009.

In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful
Life of Intangible Assets” (FSP FAS 142-3). This position amends the factors an entity should
consider when developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life over
which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” FSP FAS 142-3 requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in
renewing or extending similar arrangements in determining the amortizable useful life.
Additionally, this position requires expanded disclosure regarding renewable intangible assets. FSP
FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The guidance for
determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to
intangible assets acquired after the effective date. Early adoption
was prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of
FSP FAS 142-3 on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles” (FAS 162). FAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework
for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. FAS 162 became
effective on November 15, 2008.

In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1,
“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities” (FSP EITF 03-6-1), which requires entities to apply the two-class method of computing
basic and diluted earnings per share for participating securities that include awards that accrue
cash dividends (whether paid or unpaid) any time common shareholders receive dividends and those
dividends will not be returned to the entity if the employee forfeits the award. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those
years. Early adoption was prohibited and retroactive disclosure is
required. We do not expect the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on
January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, “Disclosures by Public
Entities (Enterprises) About Transfers of Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest
Entities.” This FSP amends SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities,” to require additional disclosures about transfers of
financial assets. This FSP also amends FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,” to require additional disclosure regarding involvement with variable interest
entities. The adoption of the disclosure requirements of this FSP as of December 2008 did not have
a material effect on our notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement
Benefit Plan Assets.” This FSP amends SFAS No. 132(R), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106,” to require
more detailed disclosures about employers’ plan assets, including employers’ investment strategies,
major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques
used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The additional disclosure requirements of this FSP
are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009.

Critical Accounting Policies

We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial
statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements. The preparation of these financial



statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures
of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We
evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical
experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting
treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ
from these estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the
fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (FAS 142), goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, as of January 1 for the
recent completed fiscal year, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step process. The first step of
the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of
the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment
loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. As of December 31,
2008, goodwill totaled $3,083.0 million as compared with $3,789.1 million at December 31, 2007.
Total goodwill represented 35% of total assets at December 31, 2008, compared with 42% and 18% as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 resulted from a $596.2 million
reduction in the Florida Rock acquisition goodwill as a result of the final purchase price
allocation (for more details, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements) as well as a
goodwill impairment charge of $252.7 million as noted below. The increase in 2007 resulted primarily from
the preliminary purchase price allocation for the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition.

The impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their
carrying value, including assigned goodwill. We have four operating segments organized around our
principal product lines: aggregates, asphalt mix, concrete and cement. Within these four operating
segments, we have identified 13 reporting units based primarily on geographical location. The
carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning assets and liabilities, including
goodwill, to those reporting units as of the January 1 measurement date. We estimate the fair
values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income
approach, which involves discounting estimated future cash flows, and a market approach, which
involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies. We consider
market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. To
substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations, we reconcile the implied fair values to
market capitalization.

The results of the annual impairment tests performed as of January 1, 2009 indicated that the
carrying value of our Cement reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Based on the preliminary
results of the second step of the impairment test, we estimated that the entire amount of goodwill
at this reporting unit was impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $252.7 million pretax goodwill
impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2008. The results of the annual impairment tests
performed as of January 1, 2008 and 2007 indicated that the fair values of the reporting units
exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. Accordingly, there were
no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.



Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions
we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty.
Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or
management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a
decline in our stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other
factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected
future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of
our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

For additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets Excluding Goodwill

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to
amortization, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of long-lived
assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less
than their carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is determined by
primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment
and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience
and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically
review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Notes 4 and 19 to
the consolidated financial statements, respectively.

Reclamation Costs

Reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period
the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the
assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are
recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon
expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash
flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted
through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the
obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is
recognized on settlement.

In determining the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform
the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then
increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the
estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is then discounted to fair value using
present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated
years to settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the
most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates,
we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

Reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in
the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period
that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in
the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a
new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would
trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or
the closure of a facility.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (commonly known as asset retirement
obligations), see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.



Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We follow the guidance of SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (FAS 87), SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” (FAS 106), and SFAS No.
158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (FAS 158) when accounting for pension and
postretirement benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the
valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The primary assumptions are as
follows:

•

Discount Rate

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present
value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments
to be made in the future.

•

Expected Return on Plan Assets

— We project the future return on plan
assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for
future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well
as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. These
projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs.

•

Rate of Compensation Increase

— For salary-related plans only, we
project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project
employees’ pension benefits at retirement.

•

Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Healthcare Benefits

— We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare
benefits.

The provisions of FAS 87 and FAS 106 provide for the delayed recognition of differences between
actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows
for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over
the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. FAS 158 (see Note 18 to the
consolidated financial statements, caption 2006 — FAS 158 for a detailed description) partially
supersedes the delayed recognition principles of FAS 87 and FAS 106 by requiring that differences
between actual results and expected or estimated results be recognized in full in other
comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income pursuant to FAS 158 are
reclassified to earnings in accordance with the recognition principles of FAS 87 and FAS 106.

Upon our January 1, 2008 adoption of the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 (see Note 18 to the
consolidated financial statements, caption 2008 — FAS 158) we changed our measurement date for our
pension and other postretirement benefit plans to December 31. Previously, we had accelerated our
measurement date to November 30.

Annually, we review our assumptions related to the discount rate, the expected return on plan
assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality
bonds. At December 31, 2008, the discount rate for our plans increased to 6.60% from 6.45% at
November 30, 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under FAS 87 (pensions) and increased
to 6.65% from 6.10% at November 30, 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under FAS 106
(other postretirement benefits). An analysis of the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for
corresponding high-quality bonds is used in the selection of the discount rate.

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future
expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term
allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2008, the expected return on plan
assets remained 8.25%.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements
in inflation rates. At December 31, 2008, the inflation component of the assumed rate of
compensation increase remained 2.25%. In addition, based on future expectations of merit and
productivity increases, the weighted-average component of the salary increase assumption remained
2.50%.

In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we
consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 2008, our
assumed rate of increase in the per capita



cost of covered healthcare benefits increased to 9.0% for 2009, decreasing each year until reaching
5.0% in 2017 and remaining level thereafter.

Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations,
the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and other
postretirement benefit cost. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a
change in certain assumptions (in millions of dollars):

As of the December 31, 2008 measurement date, the pension plans’ fair value of assets decreased
from $679.7 million to $419.0 million due primarily to relatively poor market performance for the
domestic and international equity classes and a $48.0 million write-down in the estimated fair
value of certain assets invested at Westridge Capital Management, Inc. See Note 22 to the
consolidated financial statements. Earnings on assets above or below the expected return are
reflected in the calculation of pension expense through the calculation of the “market-related
value,” which recognizes changes in fair value averaged on a systematic basis over five years.

As a result of the June 2005 sale of our Chemicals business, as described in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, during 2006, we recognized a settlement charge of $0.8 million
representing an acceleration of unrecognized losses due to lump-sum payments to certain retirees
from our former Chemicals business.

During
2009, we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of
approximately $15.8 million and
net periodic postretirement expense of approximately $13.2 million compared with $8.2 million and
$12.3 million, respectively, in 2008. This increase in pension expense is primarily related to the
asset losses during 2008. Normal cash payments made for pension benefits in 2009 under the unfunded
plans are estimated at $3.5 million. We expect to make approximately $1.1 million in required
contributions to the funded pension plans during 2009, all of which relates to the pension plan
assumed in the Florida Rock acquisition.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), enacted on August 17, 2006, significantly changed the
funding requirements after 2007 for single-employer defined benefit pension plans, among other
provisions. Funding requirements under the PPA are largely based on a plan’s funded status, with
faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses. This Act did not have a material impact on the
funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plans during 2008.

While negative returns on plan assets in 2008 have diminished our plans’ funded status, including
the write-down in the estimated fair value of certain assets invested at Westridge Capital
Management, Inc. (see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements), we currently do not
anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds
requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 to the
consolidated financial statements.



Environmental Compliance

We incur environmental compliance costs, which include maintenance and operating costs for
pollution control facilities, the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation
efforts and other similar costs. Environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or
that relate to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with our capitalization
policy. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not
contribute to future revenues are expensed. Costs associated with environmental assessments and
remediation efforts are accrued when management determines that a liability is probable and the
cost can be reasonably estimated. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental
remediation liabilities are not easily identified, due in part to the uncertainties of varying
factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the
remediation effort occur.

When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that
no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is
accrued. As of December 31, 2008, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the
range was $2.1 million. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the
professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental
Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates, including key assumptions, for
accruing environmental compliance costs; however, a number of factors, including adverse agency
rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual
results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance
program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers’ compensation up to $2.0 million per
occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $3.0 million per occurrence. We have
excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these deductible levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are
reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future
legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their
unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal
counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation
represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our
actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. Accrued liabilities under our
self-insurance program were $57.8 million, $62.5 million and $45.2 million as of December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately $19.0 million of the increase from 2006 to 2007 relates
to liabilities acquired in the Florida Rock acquisition. Accrued liabilities for self-insurance
reserves as of December 31, 2008 were discounted at 1.96%. As of December 31, 2008, the
undiscounted amount was $61.2 million as compared with the discounted liability of $57.8 million.
Expected payments (undiscounted) for the next five years are projected as follows: 2009 — $20.2
million; 2010 — $11.0 million; 2011 — $8.5 million; 2012 — $5.3 million and 2013 — $3.9 million.

Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable
losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities
available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial reporting, we
estimate the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a
quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year
progresses, we refine the estimates of the year’s taxable income as new information becomes
available, including year-to-date financial results. This continual estimation process often
results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, we adjust
the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the
year-to-date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate. Significant judgment is required in
determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.



In accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax
deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax
benefit in the income statement. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax
asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income, and we will record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. We take into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future taxable
income, mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate, carryback and carryforward
periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of a realization of a
deferred tax asset. To the extent recovery is unlikely, a valuation allowance is established
against the deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is
made. If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax
assets in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance, an adjustment to the
deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made.
Conversely, if we were to make a determination that realization is more likely than not for
deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance would be reduced
and a benefit to earnings would be recorded.

Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas,”
does not require U.S. income taxes to be provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are
indefinitely reinvested offshore. We periodically evaluate our investment strategies with respect
to each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be
indefinitely reinvested offshore and, accordingly, whether U.S. income taxes should be provided
when such earnings are recorded.

We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48) effective January 1, 2007 (see Note 18 to the
consolidated financial statements). In accordance with FIN 48, we recognize a tax benefit
associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that
the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax
benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax
benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax
audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized
entirely in the period in which they are identified. Our effective tax rate includes the net impact
of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered
appropriate by management.

A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability
related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with
open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or
the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized
tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized
as a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable
settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate
and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. Our liability for unrecognized tax
benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one
year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current.

We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as
income tax expense.

Our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the
deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax
rate is reflected in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The deduction for statutory
depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings. Due to the
magnitude of the impact of statutory depletion on our effective tax rate and taxable income, a
significant portion of the financial reporting risk is related to this estimate.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a new deduction for certain domestic production
activities as described in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, this deduction,
subject to certain limitations, was set at 3% for 2006, 6% in 2007 and will remain at 6% through
2009 and reaches 9% in 2010 and thereafter. The



estimated impact of this deduction on the 2008, 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates is presented in
Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

For additional information regarding income taxes and our adoption of FIN 48, see Notes 9 and 18 to
the consolidated financial statements.

Forward-looking Statements

The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this
Annual Report, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in
Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I, above.



Financial Terminology

Acquisitions

The sum of net assets (assets less liabilities, including acquired debt) obtained in a business
combination. Net assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of the combination, and
include tangible and intangible items.

Capital Employed

The sum of interest-bearing debt, other noncurrent liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Average
capital employed is a 12-month average.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures include capitalized replacements of and additions to property, plant &
equipment, including capitalized leases, renewals and betterments. Capital expenditures exclude the
property, plant & equipment obtained by business acquisitions.

We classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the
project expenditures. Thus, a project is classified entirely as a replacement if that is the
principal reason for making the expenditure even though the project may involve some cost-saving
and/or capacity-improvement aspects. Likewise, a profit-adding project is classified entirely as
such if the principal reason for making the expenditure is to add operating facilities at new
locations (which occasionally replace facilities at old locations), to add product lines, to expand
the capacity of existing facilities, to reduce costs, to increase mineral reserves, to improve
products, etc.

Capital expenditures classified as environmental control do not reflect those expenditures for
environmental control activities, including industrial health programs that are expensed currently.
Such expenditures are made on a continuing basis and at significant levels. Frequently,
profit-adding and major replacement projects also include expenditures for environmental control
purposes.

Net Sales

Total customer revenues from continuing operations for our products and services excluding
third-party delivery revenues, net of discounts and taxes, if any.

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges

The sum of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interest in earnings
of a consolidated subsidiary, amortization of capitalized interest and fixed charges net of
interest capitalization credits, divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges are the sum of interest
expense before capitalization credits, amortization of financing costs and one-third of rental
expense.

Total Debt as a Percentage of Total Capital

The sum of short-term borrowings, current maturities and long-term debt, divided by total capital.
Total capital is the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity.

Shareholders’ Equity

The sum of common stock (less the cost of common stock in treasury), capital in excess of par
value, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), as reported in the
balance sheet. Average shareholders’ equity is a 12-month average.

Total Shareholder Return

Average annual rate of return using both stock price appreciation and quarterly dividend
reinvestment. Stock price appreciation is based on a point-to-point calculation, using end-of-year
data.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the
normal course of business. In order to manage or reduce these market risks, we may utilize
derivative financial instruments.

We are exposed to interest rate risk due to our various credit facilities and long-term debt
instruments. At times, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk.

In December 2007, we issued $325 million of 3-year floating (variable) rate notes that bear
interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. Concurrently, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement with a counterparty in the stated (notional) amount of $325 million and a contractual
term coinciding with the maturity of the $325 million of 3-year floating rate notes. At December
31, 2008, we recognized a liability of $16.2 million, equal to the fair value of this swap
(included in other noncurrent liabilities) and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $9.6
million, net of tax of $6.6 million, equal to the highly effective portion of this swap. At
December 31, 2007, we recognized a liability of $1.1 million equal to the fair value of this swap
(included in other noncurrent liabilities), and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.7
million, net of tax of $0.4 million, equal to the highly effective portion of this swap. We are
exposed to market risk for changes in LIBOR as a result of this interest rate swap agreement. A
decline in interest rates of 0.75 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our
liability by approximately $4.4 million.

At December 31, 2008, the estimated fair market value of our long-term debt instruments including
current maturities was $2,155.2 million as compared with a book value of $2,465.3 million. The
effect of a decline in interest rates of 1 percentage point would increase the fair market value of
our liability by approximately $74.5 million.

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for
high-quality bonds, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase for
salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.
The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit
costs is discussed in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section of this annual
report.



Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vulcan Materials Company and its
subsidiary companies (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies as of December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 2, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Vulcan Materials Company (the “Company,” “Vulcan,” “we,” “our”), a New Jersey corporation, is the
nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates, primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel; a
major producer of asphalt mix and concrete and a leading producer of cement in Florida.

On November 16, 2007, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Florida Rock Industries,
Inc. (Florida Rock), a leading producer of construction aggregates, cement, concrete and concrete
products in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states, in exchange for cash and stock. The
acquisition further diversified the geographic scope of our operations. See Note 20 for additional
disclosure regarding the Florida Rock acquisition.

Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as presented in Note 2, the operating results of the
Chemicals business have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Earnings.

See Note 15 for additional disclosure regarding nature of operations.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vulcan Materials Company and all our
majority or wholly owned subsidiary companies. All intercompany transactions and
accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents

We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value due
to their short-term maturities.

Medium-term Investments

At December 31, 2008, we held investments with a principal balance totaling approximately
$38,837,000 in money market and other money funds at The Reserve, an investment management company
specializing in such funds. The substantial majority of our investment was held in the Reserve
International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
bankruptcy protection. Shortly thereafter, The Reserve announced that it was closing certain of its
money funds, some of which owned Lehman Brothers securities, and was suspending redemptions from
and purchases of certain funds, including the Reserve International Liquidity Fund. As a result of
the temporary suspension of redemptions and the uncertainty as to the timing of such redemptions,
we have classified our investments in The Reserve funds as medium-term investments in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. Based on public statements issued
by The Reserve and the maturity dates of the underlying investments, we believe that proceeds from
the liquidation of the money funds in which we have investments will be received within one year
from the date of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, and therefore such investments have
been classified as current.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, The Reserve redeemed $258,000 of our investment. Subsequent to
December 31, 2008, The Reserve redeemed an additional
$25,203,000 of our investment at its stated value as of
December 31, 2008.

In addition, we recognized a charge of $2,103,000 (included in other income (expense), net) during
the third quarter of 2008 to reduce the principal balance to an estimate of the fair value of our
investment in these funds. This reduction resulted in a balance as of December 31, 2008 of
$36,734,000 as reported on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at such date. See the
caption Fair Value Measurements under this Note 1 for further discussion of the fair value
determination. Prior to The Reserve’s announcement that it intended to close certain money funds
and suspend redemptions, our investments in such funds could be readily converted to known amounts
of cash and accrued interest at variable market rates. Accordingly, these investments, which
amounted to $25,780,000 and $49,035,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were
classified as cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at such dates.



Accounts and Notes Receivable

Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our extending credit to trade customers
for the purchase of our products. The terms generally provide for payment within 30 days of being
invoiced. On occasion, when necessary to conform to regional industry practices, we sell product
under extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or unsecured short-term notes; or,
on occasion, notes with durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing
accounts receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from short-term transactions (less
than one year) other than the sale of our products, such as interest receivable; insurance claims;
freight claims; tax refund claims; bid deposits or rents receivable. Additionally, as of December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, other accounts and notes receivable include the current portion of the
contingent earn-out agreements referable to the Chemicals business sale as described in Note 2.
Receivables are aged and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense are
recorded.

Inventories

Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories because it results in a better matching of
costs with revenues. Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials, direct labor and
production overhead. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the
end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO
calculations are based on our estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are
subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. Substantially all operating supplies
inventory is carried at average cost.

Property, Plant & Equipment

Property, plant & equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and
amortization. The cost of properties held under capital leases is equal to the lower of the net
present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased property at the
inception of the lease.

Repair and Maintenance

Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating expense as incurred. Renewals and
betterments that add materially to the utility or useful lives of property, plant & equipment are
capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance activities,
primarily related to periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to
the next overhaul.

Depreciation, Depletion, Accretion and Amortization

Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated service lives
of the various classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (3 to 30 years), buildings
(10 to 20 years) and land improvements (7 to 20 years).

Cost depletion on depletable quarry land is computed by the unit-of-production method based on
estimated recoverable units.

Accretion reflects the period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset
retirement obligations. It is computed using the same credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to
initially measure the liability at fair value.

Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated
useful life.

Amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization is computed based on the estimated life
of the intangible assets.



As described in Note 20, we suspended depreciation and amortization expense upon our November 16,

Company Owned Life Insurance

We have Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI) policies that were acquired in the Florida Rock
transaction in November 2007. The cash surrender values of these policies amounted to $30,235,000
and $34,004,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Loans outstanding against the cash
surrender amounted to $30,225,000 at December 31, 2008. There were no loans outstanding against the
cash surrender values of these policies at December 31, 2007. The loans are presented as a
reduction of the respective cash surrender values included in other noncurrent assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Measurements

On January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (FAS 157) with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer
our adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. FAS 157-2 (FSP FAS 157-2). FAS 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. Fair value under FAS 157 is defined as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. FAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief
description of those three levels:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2:

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
observable market data;



Level 3:

Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair
value measurement.

The following table presents a summary of our financial assets and liabilities as of December
31, 2008 that are subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis (in thousands of dollars):

The medium-term investments are comprised of money market and other money funds, as more fully
described previously in this note under the caption, Medium-term Investments. We estimated the fair
value of these funds by adjusting the investment principle to reflect the complete write-down of
the funds’ investments in securities of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and by estimating a discount
on other securities assuming early redemption will result in losses. The foreign currency
derivative consists of a forward foreign currency exchange contract and is measured at fair value
based on the foreign currency spot rate from an actively quoted market. The interest rate
derivative consists of an interest rate swap agreement as more fully described in Note 5, and is
measured at fair value based on the prevailing market interest rate as of the measurement date.

The carrying values of our cash equivalents, medium-term investments, accounts and notes
receivable, trade payables, accrued expenses and short-term borrowings approximate their fair
values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative
instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

Derivative Instruments Excluding ECU Earn-out

We periodically use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, currency
exchange risk or price fluctuations on commodity energy sources consistent with our risk management
policies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments are presented in Note 5.

ECU Earn-out

In connection with the June 2005 sale of our Chemicals business, as described in Note 2, we entered
into two separate earn-out agreements with the purchaser, Basic Chemicals Company, LLC (Basic
Chemicals). Basic Chemicals has completed payments under one earn-out agreement and is required to
make additional payments under a separate earn-out agreement subject to certain conditions. The
first earn-out agreement (the ECU earn-out) was based on ECU (electrochemical unit) and natural gas
prices during the five-year period beginning July 1, 2005,
and qualified as a derivative financial instrument under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133). The ECU earn-out was payable annually and was capped
at $150,000,000. During 2007, we received the final payment under the ECU earn-out of $22,142,000,
bringing cumulative cash receipts to the $150,000,000 cap.

FAS 133 requires all derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
The fair value of the ECU earn-out was adjusted quarterly based on the expected future cash flows.
We did not designate the ECU earn-out as a hedging instrument and, accordingly, gains and losses
resulting from changes in the fair value were recognized in current earnings. Further, pursuant to
the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5:Z:5, “Classification and
Disclosure of Contingencies Relating to Discontinued Operations” (SAB Topic 5:Z:5), changes in fair
value were recognized in continuing operations. The carrying amount (fair value) of the



ECU earn-out was classified in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as current (accounts and
notes receivable — other) or long-term (other noncurrent assets) based on our expectation of the
timing of cash flows. The carrying amount of the ECU earn-out was as follows: December 31, 2008 —
$0; December 31, 2007 — $0 and December 31, 2006 — $20,213,000 (classified entirely as current).

The discounted cash flow model utilized to determine the fair value of the ECU earn-out required
significant estimates and judgments described hereafter. An ECU is defined as the price of one
short ton of chlorine plus the price of 1.1 short tons of caustic soda. The expected future prices
for an ECU and natural gas were critical variables in the discounted cash flow model. Our estimates
of these variables were derived from industry ECU pricing and current natural gas futures
contracts. In addition, significant judgment was required in assessing the likelihood of the
amounts and timing of each possible outcome. Additional disclosures regarding the ECU earn-out are
presented in Notes 2 and 5.

Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the
fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (FAS 142), goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, as of January 1 for the
recent completed fiscal year, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step process. The first step of
the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of
the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment
loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. As of December 31,
2008, goodwill totaled $3,083,013,000, as compared with $3,789,091,000 at December 31, 2007. Total
goodwill represented 35% of total assets at December 31, 2008, compared with 42% and 18% as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008
resulted primarily from a $596,180,000
reduction in the Florida Rock acquisition goodwill as a result of the final purchase price
allocation (for more details, see Note 20) as well as a goodwill
impairment charge of $252,664,000 as
noted below. The increase in 2007 resulted primarily from the preliminary purchase price allocation
for the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition.

The impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their
carrying value, including assigned goodwill. We have four operating segments organized around our
principal product lines: aggregates, asphalt mix, concrete and cement. Within these four operating
segments, we have identified 13 reporting units based primarily on geographical location. The
carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning assets and liabilities, including
goodwill, to those reporting units as of the January 1 measurement date. We estimate the fair
values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income
approach, which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach, which
involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies. We consider
market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. To substantiate the fair
values derived from these valuations, we reconcile the implied fair values to our market
capitalization.

The results of the annual impairment tests performed as of January 1, 2009 indicated that the
carrying value of our Cement reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Based on the preliminary
results of the second step of the impairment test, we estimated that the entire amount of goodwill
at this reporting unit was impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $252,664,000 pretax goodwill impairment
charge for the year ended December 31, 2008. The results of the annual impairment tests performed
as of January 1, 2008 and 2007 indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their
carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. Accordingly, there were no charges for
goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.



Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions
we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty.
Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or
management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a
decline in our stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other
factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected
future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of
our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

For additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 19.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets Excluding Goodwill

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to
amortization, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of long-lived
assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less
than their carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is determined by
primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment
and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience
and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically
review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Notes 4 and 19.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized at the time the sale price is fixed, the product’s title is transferred to
the buyer and collectibility of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured. Total revenues include
sales of products to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and third-party delivery revenues
billed to customers.

Stripping Costs

In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral
deposits are referred to as stripping costs.

Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered costs of extracted minerals
under our inventory costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in the same period
as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. Additionally, we capitalize such costs as inventory
only to the extent inventory exists at the end of a reporting period.

Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production
stripping) are excluded from our inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are expensed as
incurred unless certain criteria are met. Capitalized pre-construction stripping costs are reported
within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are typically
amortized over the productive life of the mine.

Other Costs

Costs are charged to earnings as incurred for the start-up of new plants and for normal recurring
costs of mineral exploration and research and development. Research and development costs for
continuing operations totaled $1,546,000 in 2008, $1,617,000 in 2007 and $1,704,000 in 2006, and
are included in selling, administrative and general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

Share-based Compensation

Our 1996 Long-term Incentive Plan expired effective May 1, 2006. Effective May 12, 2006, our
shareholders approved the 2006 Omnibus Long-term Incentive Plan (Plan), which authorizes the
granting of stock options, Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights (SOSARs) and other types of
share-based awards to key salaried employees and non-employee directors. The maximum number of
shares that may be issued under the Plan is 5,400,000. As a result of the merger between us and
Florida Rock, we can grant long-term incentive awards under Florida Rock’s



shareholder approved Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Plan. The maximum number of shares available is 381,010 after
adjustment for the merger. These shares are available for grants until September 30, 2010.

We account for our share-based compensation awards using fair-value-based measurement methods as
prescribed by SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Stock-Based Payment” [FAS 123(R)]. This results in the
recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards, including stock
options, based on their fair value as of the grant date. For awards granted prior to our January 1,
2006 adoption of FAS 123(R), compensation cost for all share-based compensation awards is
recognized over the nominal (stated) vesting period. For awards granted subsequent to our adoption
of FAS 123(R), compensation cost is recognized over the shorter of:

•

the nominal vesting period or

•

the period until the employee’s award becomes nonforfeitable upon
reaching eligible retirement age under the terms of the award.

We receive an income tax deduction for share-based compensation equal to the excess of the market
value of our common stock on the date of exercise or issuance over the exercise price. The tax
benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess tax
benefits) is classified as financing cash flows. The $11,209,000, $29,220,000 and $17,376,000 in
excess tax benefits classified as financing cash inflows for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relate to
the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under long-term incentive plans.

A summary of unrecognized compensation expense as of December 31, 2008 related to share-based
awards granted under our long-term incentive plans is presented below (in thousands of dollars):

Reclamation Costs

Reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period
the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the
assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are
recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon
expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash
flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted
through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the
obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is
recognized on settlement.

In determining the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform
the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then
increased for both future estimated inflation



and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is then discounted to fair value using
present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated
years to settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the
most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates,
we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

Reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in
the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period
that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in
the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a
new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would
trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or
the closure of a facility.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (commonly known as asset retirement
obligations), see Note 17.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We follow the guidance of SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (FAS 87), SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” (FAS 106), and SFAS No.
158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (FAS 158) when accounting for pension and
postretirement benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the
valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The primary assumptions are as
follows:

•

Discount Rate

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present
value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments
to be made in the future.

•

Expected Return on Plan Assets

— We project the future return on plan
assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for
future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well
as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. These
projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs.

•

Rate of Compensation Increase

— For salary-related plans only, we
project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project
employees’ pension benefits at retirement.

•

Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Healthcare Benefits

— We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare
benefits.

The provisions of FAS 87 and FAS 106 provide for the delayed recognition of differences between
actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows
for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over
the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. FAS 158 (see Note 18, caption 2006
— FAS 158 for a detailed description) partially supersedes the delayed recognition principles of
FAS 87 and FAS 106 by requiring that differences between actual results and expected or estimated
results be recognized in full in other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other
comprehensive income pursuant to FAS 158 are reclassified to earnings in accordance with the
recognition principles of FAS 87 and FAS 106.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10.

Environmental Compliance

We incur environmental compliance costs, which include maintenance and operating costs for
pollution control facilities, the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation
efforts and other similar costs. Environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or
that relate to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with our capitalization
policy. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not
contribute to future revenues are expensed. Costs associated with environmental assessments and
remediation efforts are accrued when management determines that a liability is probable and the
cost can be



reasonably estimated. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental
remediation liabilities are not easily identified, due in part to the uncertainties of varying
factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the
remediation effort occur.

When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that
no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is
accrued. As of December 31, 2008, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the
range was $2,054,000. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the
professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental
Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates, including key assumptions, for
accruing environmental compliance costs; however, a number of factors, including adverse agency
rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual
results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see Note 8.

Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance
program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers’ compensation up to $2,000,000 per
occurrence, and automotive and general/product liability up to $3,000,000 per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per
occurrence basis beyond these deductible levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are
reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future
legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their
unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal
counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation
represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our
actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. Accrued liabilities under our
self-insurance program were $57,752,000, $62,514,000 and $45,197,000 as of December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. Approximately $19,000,000 of the increase from 2006 to 2007 relates to
liabilities acquired in the Florida Rock acquisition. Accrued liabilities for self-insurance
reserves as of December 31, 2008 were discounted at 1.96%. As of December 31, 2008, the
undiscounted amount was $61,206,000 as compared with the discounted liability of $57,752,000.
Expected payments (undiscounted) for the next five years are projected as follows: 2009 —
$20,195,000; 2010 — $11,040,000; 2011 — $8,520,000; 2012 — $5,290,000 and 2013 — $3,879,000.

Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable
losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities
available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial reporting, we
estimate the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a
quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year
progresses, we refine the estimates of the year’s taxable income as new information becomes
available, including year-to-date financial results. This continual estimation process often
results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, we adjust
the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the
year-to-date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate. Significant judgment is required in
determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax
deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax
benefit in the income statement. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax
asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income, and we will record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. We take into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future taxable
income, mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate, carryback and carryforward
periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of a



realization of a deferred tax asset. To the extent recovery is unlikely, a valuation allowance is established
against the deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is
made. If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax
assets in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance, an adjustment to the
deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made.
Conversely, if we were to make a determination that realization is more likely than not for
deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance would be reduced
and a benefit to earnings would be recorded.

Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas,”
does not require U.S. income taxes to be provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are
indefinitely reinvested offshore. We periodically evaluate our investment strategies with respect
to each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be
indefinitely reinvested offshore and, accordingly, whether U.S. income taxes should be provided
when such earnings are recorded.

We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48) effective January 1, 2007 (see Note 18). In
accordance with FIN 48, we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when,
in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by
a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the
largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is
adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law
developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the
period in which they are identified. Our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by
management.

A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability
related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with
open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or
the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized
tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized
as a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable
settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate
and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. Our liability for unrecognized tax
benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one
year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current.

We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as
income tax expense.

Our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the
deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax
rate is reflected in Note 9. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change
proportionately to changes in pretax earnings. Due to the magnitude of the impact of statutory
depletion on our effective tax rate and taxable income, a significant portion of the financial
reporting risk is related to this estimate.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a new deduction for certain domestic production
activities as described in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, this deduction,
subject to certain limitations, was set at 3% for 2006, 6% in 2007 and will remain at 6% through
2009 and reaches 9% in 2010 and thereafter. The estimated impact of this deduction on the 2008,
2007 and 2006 effective tax rates is presented in Note 9.

For additional information regarding income taxes and our adoption of FIN 48, see Notes 9 and 18.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

We report comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Shareholder’s Equity.
Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to equity from nonowner sources. Comprehensive
income comprises two subsets: net earnings (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).
Historically, other comprehensive income (loss) includes fair value adjustments to cash flow
hedges, minimum pension liability adjustments (prior to December 31,



2006), and actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs recognized in accordance with FAS 158 (effective beginning December
31, 2006).

Earnings Per Share (EPS)

We report two earnings per share numbers, basic and diluted. These are computed by dividing net
earnings (loss) by the weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or weighted-average
common shares outstanding assuming dilution (diluted EPS), as set forth below (in thousands of
shares):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (FAS 157), which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted FAS 157 with respect to financial assets and
liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as
permitted by FSP FAS 157-2. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities had no
effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Additionally, its adoption
resulted in no material changes in our valuation methodologies, techniques or assumptions for such
assets and liabilities. See the caption Fair Value Measurements under this Note 1 for the
disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities pursuant to the requirements of FAS 157.

FAS 157 applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be
measured at fair value; accordingly, it does not expand the use of fair value in any new
circumstances. Fair value under FAS 157 is defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the
assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. In support of this
principle, the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to
develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in
active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data; for example, a reporting entity’s own
data. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the
fair value hierarchy. For nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those items recognized or
disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequent basis, FSP FAS 157-2 requires companies to
adopt the provisions of FAS 157 for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 with early
adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
liabilities on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations” [FAS 141(R)], which
requires the acquirer in a business combination to measure all assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at their acquisition date fair value. FAS 141(R) applies whenever an acquirer obtains
control of one or more businesses. Additionally, the new standard requires that in a business
combination:

•

Acquisition related costs, such as legal and due diligence costs, be expensed as incurred.

•

Acquirer shares issued as consideration be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date.

•

Contingent consideration arrangements be included in the purchase price allocation at their
acquisition



date fair value.

•

With certain exceptions, pre-acquisition contingencies be recorded at fair value.

•

Negative goodwill be recognized as income rather than as a pro rata reduction of the value
allocated to particular assets.

•

Restructuring plans be recorded in purchase accounting only if the requirements in FASB
Statement No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” are
met as of the acquisition date.

FAS 141(R) requires prospective application for business combinations consummated in fiscal years
beginning on or after December 15, 2008; we will adopt FAS 141(R) as of January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51” (FAS 160). The standard requires all entities to report
noncontrolling interests, sometimes referred to as minority interests, in subsidiaries as equity in
the consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling interest under FAS 160 is defined as the
portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The
standard requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be
clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, but separate from
the parent’s equity. The amount of consolidated net earnings attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interest should be presented separately on the face of the consolidated statement of
earnings. When a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the
former subsidiary should be measured at fair value, and a gain or loss recognized accordingly. FAS
160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 160
on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (FAS 161). The enhanced disclosure
requirements of FAS 161 are intended to help investors better understand how and why an entity uses
derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entity’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. The enhanced disclosures include, for example:

•

Qualitative disclosure about the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments.

•

Tabular disclosures of the fair value amounts of derivative instruments, their gains and
losses and locations within the financial statements.

•

Disclosure of any features in a derivative instrument that are credit-risk related.

FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We expect to adopt the disclosure
requirements of FAS 161 no later than our interim period ending March 31, 2009.

In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of
Intangible Assets” (FSP FAS 142-3). This position amends the factors an entity should consider when
developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life over which to
amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” FSP FAS 142-3 requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in
renewing or extending similar arrangements in determining the amortizable useful life.
Additionally, this position requires expanded disclosure regarding renewable intangible assets. FSP
FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The guidance for
determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to
intangible assets acquired after the effective date. Early adoption
is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of
FSP FAS 142-3 on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles” (FAS 162). FAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework
for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. FAS 162 became
effective on November 15, 2008.



In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1,
“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities” (FSP EITF 03-6-1), which requires entities to apply the two-class method of computing
basic and diluted earnings per share for participating securities that include awards that accrue
cash dividends (whether paid or unpaid) any time common shareholders receive dividends and those
dividends will not be returned to the entity if the employee forfeits the award. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those
years. Early adoption was prohibited and retroactive disclosure is
required. We do not expect the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on
January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, “Disclosures by Public
Entities (Enterprises) About Transfers of Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest
Entities.” This FSP amends SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities,” to require additional disclosures about transfers of
financial assets. This FSP also amends FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,” to require additional disclosure regarding involvement with variable interest
entities. The adoption of the disclosure requirements of this FSP as of December 2008 did not have
a material effect on our notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement
Benefit Plan Assets.” This FSP amends SFAS No. 132(R), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106,” to require more
detailed disclosures about employers’ plan assets, including employers’ investment strategies,
major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques
used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The additional disclosure requirements of this FSP
are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of
contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate
these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience,
current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting
treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Note 2 Discontinued Operations

In June 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business, known as Vulcan
Chemicals, to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation. The purchaser also
assumed certain liabilities relating to the Chemicals business, including the obligation to monitor
and remediate all releases of hazardous materials at or from the Wichita, Geismar and Port Edwards
plant facilities. The decision to sell the Chemicals business was based on our desire to focus our
resources on the Construction Materials business.

In consideration for the sale of the Chemicals business, Basic Chemicals made an initial cash
payment of $214,000,000. Concurrent with the sale transaction, we acquired the minority partner’s
49% interest in the joint venture for an initial cash payment of $62,701,000, and conveyed such
interest to Basic Chemicals. The net initial cash proceeds of $151,299,000 were subject to
adjustments for actual working capital balances at the closing date, transaction costs and income
taxes. In 2006 we received additional cash proceeds of $10,202,000 related to adjustments for
actual working capital balances at the closing date.

Basic Chemicals completed payment under one earn-out agreement and is required to make additional
payments under a separate earn-out agreement subject to certain conditions. The first earn-out
agreement was based on ECU and natural gas prices during the five-year period beginning July 1,
2005, and was capped at $150,000,000 (ECU earn-out or ECU derivative). During 2007, we received the
final payment under the ECU earn-out of $22,142,000,



bringing cumulative cash receipts to the $150,000,000 cap. The ECU earn-out was accounted for as a derivative instrument; accordingly, it
was reported at fair value. Changes to the fair value of the ECU derivative were recorded within
continuing operations pursuant to SAB Topic 5:Z:5. Proceeds under the second earn-out agreement are
determined based on the performance of the hydrochlorocarbon product HCC-240fa (commonly referred
to as 5CP) from the closing of the transaction through December 31, 2012 (5CP earn-out). Under this
earn-out agreement, cash plant margin for 5CP, as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement, in
excess of an annual threshold amount is shared equally between Vulcan and Basic Chemicals. The
primary determinant of the value for this earn-out is the level of growth in 5CP sales volume.

As the proceeds from sale are spread over multiple years and the ultimate gain on sale, if any,
will be recorded based on future 5CP receipts as described later in this note, the net cash
proceeds from the 2005 sale of the Chemicals business are presented in the table below for the
years ended December 31 starting with the sale year, 2005, to augment the reader’s understanding

The carrying amounts of the ECU and 5CP earn-outs are reflected in accounts and notes receivable —
other and other noncurrent assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying
amount of the ECU earn-out was as follows: December 31, 2008 — $0; December 31, 2007 — $0 and
December 31, 2006 — $20,213,000 (classified entirely as current). During 2007, we received
payments of $22,142,000 under the ECU earn-out and recognized gains related to changes in the fair
value of the ECU earn-out of $1,929,000 (reflected as a component of other income, net in our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings). During 2006, we received payments of $127,858,000 under the
ECU earn-out and recognized gains related to changes in the fair value of the ECU earn-out of
$28,721,000 (reflected as a component of other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings).

During 2008, we received a payment of $10,014,000 under the 5CP earn-out related to the year ended
December 31, 2007. During 2007, we received a payment of $8,418,000 under the 5CP earn-out related
to the year ended December 31, 2006. During 2006, we received net payments of $3,856,000 under the
5CP earn-out related to the period from the closing of the transaction in June 2005 through
December 31, 2005. Additionally, the final resolution during 2006 of adjustments for working
capital balances at the closing date resulted in an increase to the carrying amount of the 5CP
earn-out of $4,053,000. The carrying amounts of the 5CP earn-out were as follows: December 31, 2008
— $10,814,000 (of which $9,737,000 was current); December 31, 2007 — $20,828,000 (of which
$8,799,000 was current) and December 31, 2006 — $29,246,000 (of which $9,030,000 was current).

At the closing date, the fair value of the consideration received in connection with the sale of
the Chemicals business, including anticipated cash flows from the two earn-out agreements, was
expected to exceed the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold. However, pursuant to
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” since the proceeds under the earn-out agreements were
contingent in nature, no gain was recognized on the Chemicals sale and the value



recorded at the
June 7, 2005 closing date referable to these two earn-outs was limited to $128,167,000.
Furthermore, under SAB Topic 5:Z:5, upward adjustments to the fair value of the ECU earn-out
subsequent to closing, which totaled $51,070,000, were recorded in continuing operations, and
therefore did not contribute to the gain or loss on the sale of the Chemicals business. Ultimately,
any gain or loss on the sale of the Chemicals business will be recognized to the extent future cash
receipts under the 5CP earn-out related to the remaining performance period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012 exceed or fall short of its
December 31, 2008 carrying amount of $10,814,000.

We are potentially liable for a cash transaction bonus payable in the future to certain key former
Chemicals employees. This transaction bonus will be payable only if cash receipts realized from the
two earn-out agreements described above exceed an established minimum threshold. Amounts due would
be payable annually based on the prior year’s results. Based on our 2008 results, the 2009 payout
is projected to be $500,000. Therefore, we have accrued this amount as of December 31, 2008. Future
expense, if any, is dependent upon our receiving sufficient cash receipts under the remaining
earn-out and will be accrued in the period the bonus is earned.

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived
Assets,” the financial results of the Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented.

There were no net sales or revenues from discontinued operations for the years presented. Pretax
losses from discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands of dollars):




Discontinued Operations

Pretax loss

($4,059

($19,327

)

($16,624

The pretax losses from discontinued operations primarily reflect charges related to general and
product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs
associated with our former Chemicals businesses. Additionally, the pretax loss for 2008 includes
$500,000 related to the cash transaction bonus as noted above. We recorded pretax charges including
legal defense costs of $743,000, $16,373,000 and $9,387,000, during 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, related to a product liability claim filed by the city of Modesto, California (see
Note 12).

The acquisition of Florida Rock accounted for $80,255,000 of the increase in inventory during 2007.
In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, as of December 31, 2007, inventories of
$11,595,000 were classified as assets held for sale as described in Note 20.

Including amounts classified as held for sale, inventories valued under the LIFO method totaled
$269,598,000, $269,458,000 and $181,851,000 at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
During 2008 and 2007, reductions in LIFO inventory layers resulted in liquidations of LIFO
inventory layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of current-year purchases. The effect of the
LIFO liquidation on 2008 results was to decrease cost of goods sold by $2,654,000; increase
earnings from continuing operations by $1,605,000; and increase net
earnings by $1,605,000. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2007 results
was to decrease cost of goods sold by $85,000; increase earnings from



continuing operations by $52,000; and increase net earnings by $52,000.

Estimated current cost exceeded LIFO cost at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 by $125,997,000,
$85,067,000 and $57,979,000, respectively. We use the LIFO method of valuation for most of our
inventories as it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. We provide supplemental
income disclosures to facilitate comparisons with companies not on LIFO. The supplemental income
calculation is derived by tax-effecting the historic change in the LIFO reserve for the periods
presented. If all inventories valued at LIFO cost had been valued under the methods (substantially
average cost) used prior to the adoption of the LIFO method, the approximate effect on net earnings
would have been an increase of $26,192,000 in 2008, an increase of
$15,518,000 in 2007 and an increase of $9,579,000 in 2006.

Impairment losses represent the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the
long-lived assets. Write-downs at operating facilities resulted from decreased utilization related
to changes in the marketplace; the valuations were based on discounted cash flow analysis. We
recorded asset impairment losses related to long-lived assets as follows: 2008 — $154,000; 2007 —
$153,000 and 2006 — $226,000. These impairment losses resulted from various write-downs related to
continuing operations.

Note 5 Derivative Instruments

We periodically use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, currency
exchange risk or price fluctuations on commodity energy sources consistent with our risk management
policies.

In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a stated (notional) amount of
$50,000,000 under which we paid the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed
spread and received a fixed rate of interest of 6.40% from the counterparty to the agreement. We
designated this instrument as a highly effective fair value hedge in accordance with FAS 133.
Accordingly, the mark-to-market value of the hedge was



reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets with an adjustment to record the underlying hedged
debt at its fair value. The interest rate swap agreement terminated February 1, 2006, coinciding
with the maturity of our 6.40% 5-year notes issued in 2001 in the amount of $240,000,000.

In December 2007, we issued $325,000,000 of 3-year floating (variable) rate notes that bear
interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. Concurrently, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement with a counterparty in the stated (notional) amount of $325,000,000. Under this
agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 5.25% and receive 3-month LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum
from the counterparty. We have designated this interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of
the interest payments on the $325,000,000 of 3-year floating rate notes. The interest rate swap
agreement is scheduled to terminate December 15, 2010, coinciding with the maturity of the
$325,000,000 of 3-year floating rate notes. Concurrent with each quarterly interest payment, the
portion of this swap related to that interest payment is settled and the associated realized gain
or loss is recognized. At December 31, 2008, we recognized a liability of $16,247,000 equal to the
fair value of this swap (included in other noncurrent liabilities) and an accumulated other
comprehensive loss of $9,615,000, net of tax of $6,632,000, equal to the highly effective portion
of this swap. At December 31, 2007, we recognized a liability of $1,099,000 equal to the fair value
of this swap (included in other noncurrent liabilities), and an accumulated other comprehensive
loss of $664,000, net of tax of $435,000, equal to the highly effective portion of this swap.

Additionally, during 2007, we entered into fifteen forward starting interest rate swap agreements
for a total notional amount of $1,500,000,000. The objective of these swap agreements was to hedge
against the variability of future interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on a
portion of the then anticipated fixed-rate debt issuance in 2007 to fund the cash portion of the
Florida Rock acquisition. We entered into five 5-year swap agreements with a blended swap rate of
5.29% on an aggregate notional amount of $500,000,000, seven 10-year swap agreements with a blended
swap rate of 5.51% on an aggregate notional amount of $750,000,000 and three 30-year swap
agreements with a blended swap rate of 5.58% on an aggregate notional amount of $250,000,000. On
December 11, 2007, upon the issuance of the related fixed-rate debt, we terminated and settled for
a cash payment of $57,303,000 a portion of these forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional
amount of $900,000,000
($300,000,000 5-year, $350,000,000 10-year and $250,000,000 30-year).

In December 2007, the remaining forward starting swaps were extended to August 29, 2008, and were
composed of two 5-year swap agreements with a blended swap rate of 5.71% on an aggregate notional
amount of $200,000,000 and four 10-year swap agreements with a blended swap rate of 5.65% on an
aggregate notional amount of $400,000,000. These remaining forward starting swap agreements were
designated as cash flow hedges against the variability of future interest payments attributable to
changes in interest rates on the then anticipated fixed-rate long-term debt to be issued during
2008. On June 20, 2008, upon the issuance of $650,000,000 of related fixed-rate debt, we terminated
and settled for a cash payment of $32,474,000 the remaining forward starting swaps.

Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive loss related to the highly effective portion of the
fifteen forward starting interest rate swaps totaled $47,336,000, net of tax of $32,653,000, as of
December 31, 2008. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (FAS 133), these amounts will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term
of the related debt. At December 31, 2007, we recognized a liability of $41,312,000 equal to the
fair value of these swaps (included in other noncurrent liabilities), and an accumulated other
comprehensive loss of $22,721,000, net of tax of $14,857,000, equal to the highly effective portion
of these swaps.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized a gain of $2,169,000 (included in other
income
(expense), net) due to hedge ineffectiveness related to the forward-starting interest rate swap
agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a loss of $5,154,000 (included
in other income (expense), net) due to hedge ineffectiveness related to the forward-starting
interest rate swap agreements. Additionally during 2007, we recognized a loss of $1,422,000 related
to the discontinuance of cash flow hedging on a portion of our forward starting interest rate swaps
when it became probable that the original forecasted transactions would not occur by the end of the
originally specified time period or within an additional two-month time period. There was no impact
to earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness during the year ended December 31, 2006.



During 2009, we expect to reclassify into earnings, as interest expense, approximately $7,088,000
from amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2008.

In connection with the sale of our Chemicals business, we entered into an earn-out agreement that
required the purchaser, Basic Chemicals, to make payments capped at $150,000,000 based on ECU and
natural gas prices during the five-year period beginning July 1, 2005. We did not designate the ECU
earn-out as a hedging instrument and, accordingly, gains and losses resulting from changes in the
fair value were recognized in current earnings. Further, pursuant to SAB Topic 5:Z:5, changes in
fair value were recorded in continuing operations. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006, we recorded gains referable to the ECU earn-out of $0; $1,929,000 and $28,721,000,
respectively. These gains are reflected in other income (expense), net in our accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During 2007, we received the final payment under the ECU
earn-out of $22,142,000, bringing cumulative cash receipts to the $150,000,000 cap.

We utilize our bank lines of credit as liquidity back-up for outstanding commercial paper or draw
on the bank lines to access LIBOR-based short-term loans to fund our borrowing requirements.
Periodically, we issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes, including working capital
requirements. We plan to continue this practice from time to time as circumstances warrant.

Our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial
paper. Unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $1,672,500,000 were maintained at the end of 2008,
of which $7,500,000 expires January 28, 2009, $165,000,000 expires November 16, 2009, and
$1,500,000,000 expires November 16, 2012. As of December 31, 2008, $1,082,500,000 of the lines of
credit was drawn. Interest rates referable to borrowings under these lines of credit are determined
at the time of borrowing based on current market conditions.

All lines of credit extended to us in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were based solely on a commitment fee; no
compensating balances were required. In the normal course of business, we maintain balances for
which we are credited with earnings allowances. To the extent the earnings allowances are not
sufficient to fully compensate banks for the services they provide, we pay the fee equivalent for
the differences.

As of December 31, 2008, we have $4,977,000 of secured long-term debt, including current
maturities, assumed with the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock. All other debt obligations,
both short-term borrowings and long-term debt, are unsecured.

Includes a decrease for unamortized discounts of
$457 thousand as of December 31, 2008. The effective interest rate for
these 5-year notes is 7.47%.


Includes a decrease for unamortized discounts of
$405 thousand as of December 31, 2008. The effective interest rate for
these 10-year notes is 7.86%.


Includes a decrease for unamortized discounts of
$435 thousand and $529 thousand as of December 31, 2008 and December
31, 2007, respectively. The effective interest rate for these 5-year
notes is 6.58%.


Includes a decrease for unamortized discounts of
$178 thousand and $192 thousand as of December 31, 2008 and December
31, 2007, respectively. The effective interest rate for these 10-year
notes is 7.39%.


Includes a decrease for unamortized discounts of
$689 thousand and $695 thousand as of December 31, 2008 and December
31, 2007, respectively. The effective interest rate for these 30-year
notes is 8.04%.

The estimated fair value amounts of long-term debt presented in the table above have been
determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on credit-adjusted interest rates on
U.S. Treasury bills, notes or bonds, as appropriate. The fair value estimates are based on
information available to management as of the respective balance sheet dates. Although management
is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such
amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since those dates.

Scheduled debt payments during 2008 included $33,000,000 in December to retire a private placement
note, $15,000,000 in December representing the first quarterly payment under the 3-year floating
rate loan issued in June and payments under various miscellaneous notes that either matured at
various dates or required monthly payments. A note in the amount of $1,276,000 previously scheduled
to be retired in 2008 was extended until May 2009. Scheduled debt payments during 2007 were
composed of small miscellaneous notes that matured at various dates. Scheduled debt payments during
2006 included $240,000,000 in February to retire 6.40% 5-year notes issued in 2001 and $32,000,000
in December to retire private placement notes issued in 1996.

Debt issuances in 2008 and 2007 relate primarily to funding the November 2007 acquisition of
Florida Rock. The 2008 long-term issuances noted below effectively replace the 2007 short-term
borrowings we incurred to initially fund the cash portion of the acquisition.



In June 2008, we established a $300,000,000 3-year syndicated floating rate term loan based on a
spread over LIBOR (1, 2, 3 or 6-month LIBOR options). As of December 31, 2008, the spread was 1.5
percentage
points above the selected LIBOR option. The spread is subject to increase if our long-term credit
ratings are downgraded. This loan requires quarterly principal payments of $15,000,000 starting in
December 2008 and a principal payment of $135,000,000 in June 2011.

Additionally, in June 2008 we issued $650,000,000 of long-term notes in two series (tranches), as
follows: $250,000,000 of 5-year 6.30% coupon notes and $400,000,000 of 10-year 7.00% coupon notes.
These notes are presented in the table above net of discounts from par. These discounts are being
amortized using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the notes. The effective
interest rates for the 5-year and 10-year 2008 note issuances, including the effects of
underwriting commissions and the settlement of the forward starting interest rate swap agreements
(see Note 5), are 7.47% and 7.86%, respectively.

In December 2007, we issued $1,225,000,000 of long-term notes in four related series (tranches), as
follows: $325,000,000 of 3-year floating rate notes, $300,000,000 of 5-year 5.60% coupon notes,
$350,000,000 of 10-year 6.40% coupon notes and $250,000,000 of 30-year 7.15% coupon notes.
Concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on the
$325,000,000 3-year floating rate notes to convert them to a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. These
notes are presented in the table above net of discounts from par. These discounts and the debt
issuance costs of the notes are being amortized using the effective interest method over the
respective lives of the notes. The effective interest rates for these notes, including the effects
of above mentioned interest rate swap agreement and the settlement of the forward starting interest
rate swap agreements (see Note 5), are 5.41%, 6.58%, 7.39% and 8.04% for the 3-year, 5-year,
10-year and 30-year notes, respectively.

Additionally, in November 2007 we assumed Florida Rock’s existing debt as follows: $17,550,000
($3,550,000 secured) of variable-rate tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds, unsecured notes in the
amount of $592,000 as of December 31, 2007 and secured notes in the amount of $1,777,000 as of
December 31, 2007.

During 1999, we accessed the public debt market by issuing $500,000,000 of 5-year and 10-year notes
in two related series (tranches) of $250,000,000 each. The 5.75% 5-year coupon notes matured in
April 2004 and the 6.00% 10-year notes mature in April 2009.

In 1999, we purchased all the outstanding common shares of CalMat Co. The private placement notes
were issued by CalMat in December 1996 in a series of four tranches at interest rates ranging from
7.19% to 7.66%. Principal payments on the notes began in December 2003 and end in December 2011.
The $15,375,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2008 is at 7.66% and matures December 2011.

During 1991, we issued $81,000,000 of medium-term notes ranging in maturity from 3 to 30 years, and
in interest rates from 7.59% to 8.85%. The $21,000,000 in medium-term notes outstanding as of
December 31, 2008 has a weighted-average maturity of 6.2 years with a weighted-average interest
rate of 8.852%.

As stated above, during 2007 we assumed $17,550,000 of variable-rate tax-exempt industrial revenue
bonds with the acquisition of Florida Rock. These bonds mature as follows: $2,250,000 maturing June
2012, $1,300,000 maturing January 2021 and $14,000,000 maturing November 2022. The first two bond
maturities are collateralized by certain property, plant & equipment. The remaining $14,000,000 of
bonds are backed by a letter of credit.

Other notes of $3,512,000 as of December 31, 2008 were issued at various times to acquire land or
businesses.



The total (principal and interest) payments of long-term debt, including current maturities, for
the five years subsequent to December 31, 2008 are as follows (in thousands of dollars):

Our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions with regard to working capital or
the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock. The percentage of
consolidated debt to total capitalization (total debt as a percentage of total capital), as defined
in our bank credit facility agreements, must be less than 65%. Our total debt as a percentage of
total capital was 50.2% as of December 31, 2008; 49.3% as of December 31, 2007; and 20.6% as of
December 31, 2006. The increase in our total debt as a percentage of total capital from 20.6% in
2006 was the result of our financing to fund the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition.

at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The short-term portion of these reserves is
included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The accrued environmental remediation costs in continuing operations relate primarily to the former
Florida Rock, CalMat and Tarmac facilities acquired in 2007, 1999 and 2000, respectively. The
former Florida Rock facilities accounted for approximately 78% of the increase in 2008. The
balances noted above for Chemicals relate to retained environmental remediation costs from the 2003
sale of the Performance Chemicals business and the 2005 sale of the Chloralkali business.

The
December 31, 2008 net deferred tax liability reflects a
$250,523,000 increase from the prior
year. This increase includes the impact of the recognition of an additional deferred tax liability
related to our acquisition of Florida Rock. The December 31, 2007 net deferred tax liability
reflects a $364,982,000 increase from the prior year, which also primarily related to our
acquisition of Florida Rock. As of the acquisition date, we recognized a deferred tax liability of
$747,069,000, reflecting the temporary differences between book and tax basis, of which
$560,872,000 was referable to fixed assets.

Our determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management’s judgment of
various future events and uncertainties, including the timing, nature and amount of future income
earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various plans to maximize the realization
of deferred tax assets. We believe that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating
earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits. However, we do not believe that it is more likely
than not that all of our state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized in future periods.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance was established against the state net operating loss deferred
tax asset through a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the amount of $6,057,000.
At December 31, 2008, we had $166,459,000 of net operating loss carryforwards in various state
jurisdictions. These losses begin to expire in 2009.

We adopted FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109,” on January 1, 2007 as discussed in Note 18. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertain
tax positions and the resulting unrecognized income tax benefits as discussed in our accounting
policy for income taxes (See Note 1, caption Income Taxes). In the
table below, we have excluded interest and penalties from the 2007 amounts
to conform with our 2008 presentation. The change in the unrecognized income
tax benefits for the years ending 2008 and 2007 is reconciled below (in thousands of dollars):

We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as
income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized as income tax expense
during 2008 was ($202,000). The balance of accrued interest and penalties included in our liability
for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and January 1, 2008 amounted to $1,376,000
and $4,050,000, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits amounts to $18,131,000,
of which $15,022,000 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.



We are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. The U.S. federal statute of limitations
for 2004 has been extended to March 15, 2009, with no anticipated significant tax decrease to any
single tax position. We anticipate no single tax position generating a significant increase or
decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions and two foreign
jurisdictions. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction
for the years prior to 2002.

We have not recognized deferred income taxes on $37,731,000 of undistributed earnings from one of
our international subsidiaries, since we consider such earnings as indefinitely reinvested. If we
distribute the subject earnings, in the form of dividends, then the distribution would be subject
to U.S. income taxes. The amount of the deferred income taxes that would be recognized is
$13,206,000.

Note 10 Benefit Plans

Upon our January 1, 2008 adoption of the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 (see Note 18,
caption 2008 — FAS 158) we changed our measurement date for our pension and other postretirement
benefit plans to December 31. Previously, our measurement date was November 30.

Pension Plans

We sponsor three funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. With the November 16, 2007
acquisition of Florida Rock we assumed a fourth plan that is closed to new participants. Effective
December 31, 2008, this assumed plan was merged with the Chemicals Hourly Plan. The remaining three
plans cover substantially all employees hired prior to July 15, 2007, other than those covered by
union-administered plans. Normal retirement age is 65, but the plans contain provisions for earlier
retirement. Benefits for the Salaried Plan and the closed plan we assumed from Florida Rock are
generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the Construction Materials Hourly Plan
and the Chemicals Hourly Plan provide benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of
service. Effective July 15, 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans and our then
existing defined contribution 401K plans to no longer accept new participants. Existing
participants continue to accrue benefits under these plans. Salaried and non-union hourly employees
hired on or after July 15, 2007 are eligible for a single defined contribution 401K/Profit-Sharing
plan rather than both a defined benefit and a defined contribution plan.

Additionally, we sponsor unfunded, nonqualified pension plans, including one such plan assumed in
the Florida Rock acquisition, that are included in the tables below. The projected benefit
obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of assets for these plans were:
$53,701,000, $49,480,000, and $0 at December 31, 2008, $57,140,000, $40,892,000 and $0 at December
31, 2007 and $37,081,000, $31,351,000 and $0 at December 31, 2006. Approximately $8,100,000 and
$8,900,000 of the obligations at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, relate to
existing Florida Rock retirees receiving benefits under the assumed plan.

Actual return on plan assets during 2008 includes a $48,018 thousand write-down in the estimated fair value of certain assets invested in Westridge Capital Management, Inc. The write-down, net of
income taxes, was recorded in other comprehensive loss for 2008. See
Note 22.

The accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets for
all of our defined benefit plans at December 31, 2008. Plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit
obligation and the projected benefit obligation at December 31,
2007 and 2006.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $581,653,000 at
December 31, 2008; $582,589,000 at December 31, 2007; and $533,906,000 at December 31, 2006. The
accumulated benefit obligation resulting from the Florida Rock acquisition was approximately
$35,900,000 as of December 31, 2007.

During 2006, we recognized a settlement charge of $826,000 representing an acceleration of
unrecognized losses due to lump-sum payments to certain retirees from our former Chemicals
business.

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated
other comprehensive income into net periodic pension benefit cost during 2009 are $1,165,000 and
$460,000, respectively.



Plan assets are composed primarily of marketable domestic and international equity securities,
corporate and government debt securities and other specialty investments. Our pension plan asset
allocation ranges for 2009 and asset allocation percentages at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are

Equity securities include domestic investments in the Russell 3000 Index and foreign equities in
the Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Emerging
Market Indices. Debt securities include domestic debt instruments, while the other asset category
includes investments in venture capital, buyout funds, mezzanine debt private partnerships and an
interest in a commodity index fund as well as cash reserves.

We establish our pension investment policy by evaluating asset/liability studies periodically
performed by our consultants. These studies estimate trade-offs between expected returns on our
investments and the variability in anticipated cash contributions to fund our pension liabilities.
Our policy accepts a relatively high level of variability in potential pension fund contributions
in exchange for higher expected returns on our investments and lower expected future contributions.
We believe this policy is prudent given our pension funding levels and is reflective of our
practice of maintaining a strong balance sheet over time.

Our current strategy for implementing this policy is to invest a relatively high proportion in
publicly traded equities and moderate amounts in long-term publicly traded debt and private,
nonliquid opportunities, such as venture capital, commodities, buyout funds and mezzanine debt. The
shift in the percentage of plan assets by asset category in 2008 results from the performance of
the various asset classes and not from a change in policy with respect to asset allocation.

The policy, set by the Board’s Finance and Pension Funds Committee, is articulated through
guideline ranges and targets for each asset category: domestic equities, foreign equities, bonds,
specialty investments and cash reserves. Management implements the strategy within these guidelines
and reviews the financial results quarterly, while the Finance and Pension Funds Committee reviews
them semiannually.

Assumptions regarding our expected return on plan assets are based primarily on judgments made by
management and the Board committee. These judgments take into account the expectations of our
pension plan consultants and actuaries and our investment advisors, and the opinions of market
professionals. We base our expected return on long-term investment expectations. Accordingly, the
expected return has remained 8.25% since our 1986 adoption of FAS 87 and has not varied due to
short-term results above or below our long-term expectations.

Certain of our hourly employees in unions are covered by multi-employer defined benefit pension
plans. Contributions to these plans approximated $8,008,000 in 2008, $8,368,000 in 2007, and
$7,352,000 in 2006. The actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits and net assets
available for benefits for employees in the union-administered plans are not determinable from
available information. A total of 19% of our hourly labor force were covered by collective
bargaining agreements. Of our hourly workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements, 40%
were covered by agreements that expire in 2009.

In addition to the pension plans noted above, we have one unfunded supplemental retirement plan as
of December 31, 2008 and two unfunded supplemental retirement plans as of December 31, 2007 and
2006. The accrued costs for these supplemental retirement plans were $917,000 at December 31, 2008;
$1,104,000 at December 31, 2007; and $1,201,000 at December 31, 2006.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), enacted on August 17, 2006, significantly changed the
funding requirements after 2007 for single-employer defined benefit pension plans, among other
provisions. Funding requirements under the PPA are largely based on a plan’s funded status, with
faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses. The Act did not have a material impact on the
funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plans during 2008.

While negative returns on plan assets in 2008, including the write-down in the estimated fair value
of certain assets invested at Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (see Note 22), have diminished our
plans’ funded status, we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans
will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels
or plan administration.

Postretirement Plans

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare benefits and life insurance for some
retired employees. Effective July 15, 2007, we amended our salaried postretirement healthcare
coverage to increase the eligibility age for early retirement coverage to age 62, unless certain
grandfathered provisions were met. This change reduced the postretirement plan benefit obligation
by $7,170,000 as of July 15, 2007, and resulted in a reduction to net periodic benefit cost of
$1,042,000 for the remainder of 2007. Substantially all our salaried employees and, where
applicable, hourly employees may become eligible for those benefits if they reach a qualifying age
and meet certain service requirements while working for us. Generally, Company-provided healthcare
benefits terminate when covered individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible
for other group insurance coverage or reach age 65, whichever occurs first. The Florida Rock
acquisition increased the postretirement plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007 by
approximately $13,800,000.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Assumptions

During 2008, we reviewed our assumptions related to the discount rate, the expected return on plan
assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality
bonds. At December 31, 2008, the discount rate for our plans increased to 6.60% from 6.45% at
November 30, 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under FAS 87 (pensions) and increased
to 6.65% from 6.10% at November 30, 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under FAS 106
(other postretirement benefits). An analysis of the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for
corresponding high-quality bonds is used in the selection of the discount rate.



In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future
expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term
allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2008, the expected return on plan
assets remained 8.25%.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements
in inflation rates. At December 31, 2008, the inflation component of the assumed rate of
compensation increase remained 2.25%. In addition, based on future expectations of merit and
productivity increases, the weighted-average component of the salary increase assumption remained
2.50%.

In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we
consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 2008, our
assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits increased to 9.0%
for 2009, decreasing each year until reaching 5.0% in 2017 and remaining level thereafter.

Defined Contribution Plans

We sponsor four defined contribution plans. During 2008, the two plans assumed with the acquisition
of Florida Rock were merged into the Vulcan Materials Company 401(k)/Profit-Sharing plan.
Substantially all salaried and nonunion hourly employees are eligible to be covered by at least one
of these plans. As stated above, effective July 15, 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension
plans and our defined contribution 401(k) plans to no longer accept new participants. Existing
participants continue to accrue benefits under these plans. Salaried and nonunion hourly employees
hired on or after July 15, 2007 are eligible for a single defined contribution
401(k)/Profit-Sharing plan rather than both a defined benefit and a defined contribution plan.
Expense recognized in connection with these plans totaled $16,930,000, $10,713,000, and $12,017,000
for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Impact of Sale of the Chemicals Business

In connection with the sale of the Chemicals business, as described in Note 2, we retained the
accumulated benefit obligation for the Chemicals Hourly Pension Plan, as all active participants
ceased employment with the Company. We also retained the accumulated benefit obligation for
salaried employees who ceased participation in the Salaried Pension Plan as a result of their
termination. Both of these accumulated benefit obligations are funded by assets held in our
Master Pension Trust.

Additionally, we retained the accumulated benefit obligation for any unfunded, nonqualified pension
plans related to Chemicals salaried employees who ceased participation as a result of their
termination. The retention of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for postretirement plans
depended on whether the terminated employee reached a qualifying age and met certain service
requirements prior to termination.

Note 11 Incentive Plans

Share-based Compensation Plans

Our 1996 Long-term Incentive Plan expired effective May 1, 2006. Effective May 12, 2006, our
shareholders approved the 2006 Omnibus Long-term Incentive Plan (Plan), which authorizes the
granting of stock options, Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights (SOSARs) and other types of
share-based awards to key salaried employees and non-employee directors. The maximum number of
shares that may be issued under the Plan is 5,400,000. As a result of the merger between us and
Florida Rock, we can grant long-term incentive awards to certain employees under Florida Rock’s
shareholder approved Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Plan. The maximum number of
shares available for issuance under the Florida Rock plan is 381,010 after adjustment for the
merger. These shares are available for grants until September 30, 2010.

Deferred Stock Units

— Deferred stock units were granted to executive officers and key employees
from 2001 through 2005. These awards vest ratably in years 6 through 10 following the date of
grant, accrue dividend equivalents starting one year after grant, carry no voting rights and become
payable upon vesting. A single deferred stock unit entitles the recipient to one share of common
stock upon vesting. Vesting is accelerated upon retirement at age 62 or older, death, disability or
change of control as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested units are forfeited upon termination
of employment for any other reason. Expense provisions referable to these awards amounted to
$1,206,000 in 2008, $1,371,000 in 2007 and $1,142,000 in 2006.



The fair value of deferred stock units is estimated as of the date of grant based on the market
price of our stock on the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized in net earnings ratably over
the 10-year maximum vesting life during which employees perform related services. For awards that
may be granted on or after January 1, 2006, expense recognition would be accelerated to the
retirement eligible date for individuals meeting the requirements for immediate vesting of awards
upon reaching retirement age. The following table summarizes activity for nonvested deferred stock
units during the year ended December 31, 2008:

Performance Shares

— Performance share awards were granted annually beginning in 2003 with the
exception of 2006. Each performance share unit is equal to one share of our common stock, but
carries no voting or dividend rights. The units ultimately paid for performance share awards may
range from 0% to 200% of target. Fifty percent of the payment is based upon our three-year-average
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the three-year-average TSR performance of a
preselected comparison group of companies. The remaining 50% of the payment is based upon the
achievement of established internal financial performance targets. These awards vest on December 31
of the third year after date of grant. Vesting is accelerated upon reaching retirement age, death,
disability, or change of control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested units are
forfeited upon termination for any other reason. Awards granted prior to 2005 were paid in an equal
combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The cash portion of the award was based on the
market value of our common stock on the measurement date. Performance shares granted after 2004 are
paid entirely in shares of our common stock. Expense provisions referable to these awards amounted
to $6,227,000 in 2008, $7,684,000 in 2007 and $12,179,000 in 2006.



The fair value of performance shares is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo
simulation model. Compensation cost for awards that are paid in shares is recognized in net
earnings ratably over the three-year maximum vesting life, is based on the awards that ultimately
vest and is not adjusted for the actual target percentage achieved. Compensation cost for awards
paid in cash was recognized in net earnings over the three-year maximum vesting life and was
adjusted based upon changes in the fair market value of our common stock and changes in our
relative TSR performance and internal financial performance targets. For awards granted on or after
January 1, 2006, expense recognition is accelerated to the retirement eligible date for individuals
meeting the requirements for immediate vesting of awards upon reaching retirement age. The
following table summarizes the activity for nonvested performance share units during the year ended
December 31, 2008:

The number of common shares issued related to performance shares may range from
0% to 200% of the number of performance shares shown in the table above based on
the achievement of established internal financial performance targets and our three-year-average TSR performance relative to the three-year-average TSR performance
of a preselected comparison group of companies.

During 2007, the weighted-average grant date fair value of performance shares granted was $105.93.
No performance share awards were granted in 2006.

Cash payments under our performance share plan, net of applicable tax withholdings, were $0 in
2008, $9,144,000 in 2007 and $6,700,000 in 2006.

Stock Options/SOSARs

— Stock options/SOSARs granted have an exercise price equal to the market
value of our underlying common stock on the date of grant. With the exceptions of the stock option
grants awarded in December 2005 and January 2006, the
options/SOSARs vest ratably over 3 or 5 years and
expire 10 years subsequent to the grant. The options awarded in December 2005 and January 2006 were
fully vested on the date of grant, expire 10 years subsequent to the grant, and shares obtained
upon exercise of the options were restricted from sale until January 1, 2009 and January 24, 2009,
respectively. Vesting is accelerated upon reaching retirement age, death, disability, or change of
control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested awards are forfeited upon termination for
any other reason. Prior to the acquisition of Florida Rock, shares issued upon the exercise of
stock options were issued from treasury stock. Since that acquisition, these shares are issued from
our authorized and unissued common stock.

The fair value of stock options/SOSARs is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. Compensation expense for stock options and
SOSAR is based on this grant date fair value
and is recognized for awards that ultimately vest. The following table presents the
weighted-average fair value and the weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value
of grants for the years ended December 31:

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a U.S. Treasury security
with a maturity period equal to or approximating the option’s expected term. The dividend yield
assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts. The volatility assumption is based on the
historical volatility and expectations about future



volatility of our common stock over a period
equal to the option’s/SOSAR’s expected term and the market-based implied volatility derived from
options trading on our common stock. The expected term is based on historical experience and
expectations about future exercises and represents the period of time that options/SOSARs granted
are expected to be outstanding.

Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies

We have commitments in the form of unconditional purchase obligations as of December 31, 2008.

We provide certain third parties with irrevocable standby letters of credit in the normal course of
business. We use commercial banks to issue standby letters of credit to back our obligations to pay
or perform when required to do so pursuant to the requirements of an underlying agreement or the
provision of goods and services. The standby letters of credit listed below are cancelable only at
the option of the beneficiaries who are authorized to draw drafts on the issuing bank up to the
face amount of the standby letter of credit in accordance with its terms. Since banks consider
letters of credit as contingent extensions of credit, we are required to pay a fee until they
expire or are canceled. Substantially all our standby letters of credit have a one-year term and
are renewable annually at the option of the beneficiary.



Our standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table below (in

As described in Note 2, we may be required to make cash payments in the form of a transaction bonus
to certain key former Chemicals employees. The transaction bonus is contingent upon the amounts
received under the two earn-out agreements entered into in connection with the sale of the
Chemicals business. Amounts due would be payable annually based on the prior year’s results. Based
on our 2008 results, the 2009 payout is projected to be $500,000. Therefore, we have accrued this
amount as of December 31, 2008. Future expense, if any, is dependent upon our receiving sufficient
cash receipts under the remaining earn-out and will be accrued in the period the bonus is earned,
the year prior to payment.

As described in Note 9, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is $18,131,000 as of December
31, 2008.

We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety
and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise
abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in
safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to
comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.

We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar
state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited
number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of
remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or
prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of
remediating a given site and in determining any individual party’s share in that cost. As a result,
estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature
or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of
involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as
potential obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws, and based
our estimated accrued obligation, if any, upon our likely portion of the potential liability in
relation to the total liability of all PRPs that have been identified and are believed to be
financially viable. In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to
these sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period could be material to
our results of operations or cash flows for that period. Amounts accrued for environmental matters
are presented in Note 8.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to
determine with precision the outcome of, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits,
especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels. In
addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, certain
other legal proceedings are more specifically described below.

City of Modesto

On October 12, 2007, we reached an agreement with the City of Modesto in the case styled

City
of Modesto, et al. v. Dow Chemical Company, et al.

, filed in San Francisco County Superior
Court, California, to resolve all claims against Vulcan for a sum of $20 million. The agreement
provides for a release and dismissal or withdrawal with
prejudice of all claims against Vulcan. The agreement also expressly states that the settlement
paid by Vulcan is for



compensatory damages only and not for any punitive damages, and that Vulcan
denies any conduct capable of giving rise to an assignment of
punitive damages. The settlement was approved by the San Francisco Superior Court judge presiding over this case and thus is now
final. While we believe the verdicts rendered and damages awarded during the first phase of the
trial are contrary to the evidence presented, we settled the city’s claims in order to avoid the
costs and uncertainties of protracted litigation. The $20 million was paid during the fourth
quarter of 2007. We believe the settlement damages, legal defense costs, and other potential claims
are covered, in whole or in part, by insurance policies purchased by Vulcan, and we are pursuing
recovery from these insurers.

Although the Company’s $20 million settlement resolved all claims against Vulcan by the City of
Modesto, certain ancillary claims related to this matter remain unresolved as follows:



California Water Service Company

On June 6, 2008, we were served in the action styled

California Water Service Company v. Dow,
et al,

now pending in the San Mateo County Superior Court, California. According to the
complaint, California Water Service Company “owns and/or operates public drinking water systems,
and supplies drinking water to hundreds of thousands of residents and businesses throughout
California.” The complaint alleges that water systems in a number of communities have been
contaminated with perchloroethylene. Our former Chemicals Division produced and sold
perchloroethylene. The plaintiff is seeking compensatory damages, treble damages and punitive
damages. No discovery has been conducted in this matter. At this time we cannot determine the
likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss pertaining to this matter.

Sunnyvale, California

On January 6, 2009, we were served in an action styled

City of Sunnyvale v. Legacy Vulcan
Corporation, f/k/a Vulcan Materials Company

, filed in the San Mateo County Superior Court,
California. The plaintiffs are seeking cost recovery and other damages for alleged environmental
contamination for perchloroethylene and its breakdown products at the Sunnyvale Town Center
Redevelopment Project. No discovery has been conducted in this matter. At this time we cannot
determine the likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss pertaining to this matter.

Florida Lake Belt Litigation

On March 22, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (in a case
captioned

Sierra Club, National Resources Defense Council and National Parks Conservation
Association v. Lt. General Carl A. Stock, et al.

) ruled that a mining permit issued for our
Miami quarry, which was acquired in the Florida Rock transaction in November 2007, as well as
certain permits issued to competitors in the same region, had been improperly issued. The Court
remanded the permitting process to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers) for
further review and consideration. In July 2007, the Court ordered us and several other mining
operations in the area to cease mining excavation under the vacated permits pending the issuance by
the Corps of Engineers of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS). The District Court
decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh
Circuit reversed and remanded the case to the District Court. With issuance of the Eleventh
Circuit’s Mandate on July 1, 2008, we resumed mining at the Miami quarry. On January 30, 2009, the
District Court again issued an order invalidating certain of the Lakebelt mining permits, which
immediately stopped all mining excavation in the majority of the Lakebelt region. We have appealed
this order to the Eleventh Circuit but are not currently mining in the areas covered by the
District Court order. The Corps of Engineers is in the process of completing the SEIS as ordered by
the District Court. Based on the SEIS, the Corps of Engineers may decide to issue new permits for
Lakebelt mining, thereby essentially mooting the pending action.

IDOT/Joliet Road

In September 2001, we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the Illinois Department of
Transportation (IDOT), in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division, Illinois, alleging
damage to a 0.9-mile section of Joliet Road that bisects our McCook quarry in McCook, Illinois, a
Chicago suburb. IDOT seeks damages to “repair, restore, and maintain” the road or, in the
alternative, judgment for the cost to “improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate” vehicles
that previously used the road. The complaint also requests that the court enjoin any McCook quarry
operations that will further damage the road. The court in this case granted summary judgment in
favor of Vulcan on certain claims. The court also granted the plaintiff’s motion to amend their
complaint to add a punitive damages claim, although the court made it clear that it was not ruling
on the merits of this claim. Discovery is ongoing. A trial date tentatively has been set for 2009.
We believe that the claims and damages alleged by the State are covered by liability insurance
policies purchased by Vulcan. We have received a letter from our primary insurer stating that there
is coverage of this lawsuit under its policy; although, the letter indicates that the insurer is
currently taking the position that various damages sought by the State are not covered.

Industrial Sand

We produced and marketed industrial sand from 1988 to 1994. Since 1993 we have been sued in
numerous suits in a number of states by plaintiffs alleging that they contracted silicosis or
incurred personal injuries as a result of exposure to, or use of, industrial sand used for abrasive
blasting. As of January 5, 2009, the number of suits totaled 84 involving an aggregate of 556
plaintiffs. There are 51 pending suits with 500 plaintiffs filed in Texas. Those Texas cases are in
a State Multidistrict Litigation Court and are stayed until discovery issues are resolved. The
balance of



the suits
involving 56 plaintiffs were brought in California and Louisiana. We are seeking
dismissal of all other suits on the grounds that plaintiffs were not exposed to our product. To
date we have been successful in getting dismissals from cases involving over 17,000 plaintiffs with
little or no payments made in settlement.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal
proceedings in which we are involved and a number of factors, including developments in ongoing
discovery or adverse rulings, could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued costs. We
believe the amounts accrued in our financial statements as of December 31, 2008 are sufficient to
address claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be probable and reasonably
estimable. No liability was recorded for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to
be only reasonably possible or for which a loss could not be reasonably estimated. In addition,
losses on certain claims and litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a per
occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described more fully in Note 1 under our accounting policy
for claims and litigation including self-insurance.

Note 13 Shareholders’ Equity

During the first quarter of 2008, we issued 798,859 shares of common stock in connection with the
acquisition of an aggregates production facility located in DeKalb County, Illinois. We originally
issued the shares to an exchange accommodation titleholder (selling shareholder) in a private
placement pursuant to a planned Section 1031 reverse exchange under the Internal Revenue Code. The
selling shareholder assumed our rights and obligations under the asset purchase agreement, and we
registered the shares for public resale by the selling shareholder in order to fund its obligation.
The selling shareholder maintained legal ownership of the assets acquired until it was dissolved
during the fourth quarter of 2008, at which time legal ownership was transferred to us. The selling
shareholder qualified as a variable interest entity under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.
46 (Revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” for which we are the
primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we have consolidated the results of
operations and cash flows of the selling shareholder for the year ended December 31, 2008, which
principally consist of the receipt of net cash proceeds from the issuance of shares of $55,072,000
and the acquisition noted above for a cash payment of $55,763,000, including acquisition costs and
net of acquired cash.

During the second quarter of 2008, we issued 352,779 shares of common stock in connection with the
acquisition of an aggregates production facility in California.

In November 2007, we issued 12,604,083 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of
Florida Rock.

On February 10, 2006, the Board of Directors increased to 10,000,000 shares the existing
authorization to purchase common stock. On November 16, 2007 pursuant to the terms of the agreement
to acquire Florida Rock, all treasury stock held immediately prior to the close of the transaction
was canceled. Our Board of Directors resolved to carry forward the existing authorization to
purchase common stock. As of December 31, 2008, 3,411,416 shares remained under the current
purchase authorization.

The number and cost of shares purchased during each of the last three years and shares held in
treasury at year end are shown below:

Note 14 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to equity from nonowner sources and comprises two
subsets: net earnings (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). The components of other
comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity,
net of applicable taxes.

The amount of income tax (expense) benefit allocated to each component of other comprehensive

Note 15 Segment Reporting — Continuing Operations

We have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, asphalt
mix, concrete and cement. For reporting purposes, we have combined our Asphalt mix and Concrete
operating segments into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the
businesses exhibit similar economic characteristics, product processes, types and classes of
customer, methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Management reviews earnings from the
product line reporting units principally at the gross profit level.

The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates and related products and services in eight
regional divisions. During 2008, the Aggregates segment served markets in 23 states and the
District of Columbia, the Bahamas, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile and Mexico with a full line of
aggregates, and 7 additional states with railroad



ballast. Customers use aggregates primarily in
the construction and maintenance of highways, streets and other public works and in the
construction of housing and commercial, industrial and other nonresidential facilities. Aggregates
are a critical ingredient in the production of asphalt mix and concrete. Customers are served by
truck, rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities and sales yards. Due to
the high weight-to-value ratio of aggregates, markets generally are local in nature. Quarries
located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates
reserves may not be available. We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside
the United States. Nondomestic net sales were $25,295,000 in 2008, $19,981,000 in 2007 and
$20,595,000 in 2006.

The Asphalt mix and Concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete in
four regional divisions serving eight states primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Florida, southwestern and
western markets, the Bahamas and the District of Columbia. Additionally, two of the divisions
produce and sell other concrete products such as block, prestressed and precast and resell
purchased building materials related to the use of ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.
Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 78% of ready-mixed concrete by
weight. Our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment is almost wholly supplied with its aggregates
requirements from our Aggregates segment. These transfers are made at local market prices for the
particular grade and quality of product utilized in the production of asphalt mix and concrete.
Customers for our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment are generally served locally at our production
facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly, delivery is
time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately 20 to 25 miles from the
producing facility.

The Cement segment produces and sells Portland and masonry cement in both bulk and bags from our
Florida cement plant. Other Cement segment facilities in Florida import cement, clinker and slag
and either resell, grind, blend, bag or reprocess those materials. This segment also includes a
Florida facility that mines, produces and sells calcium products. All of these Cement segment
facilities are within the Florida regional division. Our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment is the
largest single customer of our Cement segment.

The majority of our activities are domestic. Long-lived assets outside the United States, which
primarily consist of property, plant & equipment, were $175,275,000 in 2008, $175,413,000 in 2007
and $146,457,000 in 2006. Transactions between our reportable segments are recorded at prices
approximating market levels.

Note 17 Asset Retirement Obligations

SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (FAS 143) applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction,
development and/or normal use of the underlying assets.

FAS 143 requires recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in
which it is incurred at its estimated fair value. The associated asset retirement costs are
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the
estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted through charges to operating
expenses. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the
liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement.

We record all asset retirement obligations for which we have legal obligations for land reclamation
at estimated fair value. Essentially all these asset retirement obligations relate to our
underlying land parcels, including both owned properties and mineral leases. FAS 143 results in
ongoing recognition of costs related to the depreciation of the assets and accretion of the
liability. For the years ended December 31, we recognized operating costs (accretion and
depreciation) related to FAS 143 as follows (in thousands of dollars):

Consolidated Balance Sheets.



A reconciliation of the carrying amount of our asset retirement obligations for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows (in thousands of dollars):

$

173,435

Of the $39,926,000 of liabilities incurred during 2008, $37,234,000 relates to reclamation activity
required under new development agreements and conditional use permits (collectively the agreements)
at two aggregates facilities on owned property near Los Angeles, California. The new agreements
allow us access to significant amounts of aggregates reserves at two existing pits, which we expect
will result in a significant increase in the mining lives of these quarries. The reclamation
requirements under these agreements will result in the restoration and development of mined
property into 110 acre and 90 acre tracts suitable for commercial and retail development. Of the
$17,091,000 of liabilities incurred during 2007, $13,729,000 resulted from the acquisition of
Florida Rock.

Upward revisions to our asset retirement obligations for the year ended December 31, 2006 are
largely attributable to one aggregates facility located in California, which we operate under a
mineral lease. Extremely wet weather conditions, which flooded certain areas at the site, resulted
in higher than expected costs to extract water, dry materials, recompact affected areas and haul
away certain materials with high moisture content. We identified certain material generated in our
extraction process that precluded it from being used as fill material. Estimated costs to examine,
handle and haul such material resulted in upward revisions to our asset retirement obligations.
Delays in executing an amended lease agreement, which resulted in delays in performing our
reclamation plan, and changes to the reclamation plan that resulted from ongoing operational
logistics, caused inefficiencies related to double handling and stockpiling materials that were not
anticipated in previous cost estimates. Altogether, upward revisions to our asset retirement
obligations related to this site amounted to approximately $10.3 million during 2006.

Other net upward revisions to our asset retirement obligations during 2008, 2007 and 2006 relate
primarily to changes in cost estimates and settlement dates at numerous sites. The increase in cost
estimates during 2008 was largely attributable to rising energy-related costs, including diesel
fuel.

Note 18 Accounting Changes


—

FAS 157

On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (FAS 157) with respect to
financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial
assets and liabilities as permitted by FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-2 (FSP FAS 157-2). FAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities had no
effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Additionally, its adoption
resulted in no material changes in our valuation methodologies, techniques, or assumption
for such assets and liabilities. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 with respect to
nonfinancial assets and liabilities to have a material effect on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.



See Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements for disclosures related to financial assets
and liabilities pursuant to the requirements of FAS 157.


—

FAS 158

On January 1, 2008, we adopted the measurement date provision of SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (FAS 158). In addition to the recognition provisions (which
we adopted December 31, 2006), FAS 158 requires an employer to measure the plan assets and benefit
obligations as of the date of its year-end balance sheet. This requirement was effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2008. Upon adopting the measurement date provision, we remeasured
plan assets and benefit obligations as of January 1, 2008, pursuant to the transition requirements
of FAS 158. The transition adjustment resulted in an increase to noncurrent assets of $15,011,000,
an increase to noncurrent liabilities of $2,238,000, an increase to deferred tax liabilities of
$5,104,000, a decrease to retained earnings of $1,312,000 and an increase to accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax, of $8,981,000.


—

FIN 48

On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” by prescribing a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, the financial statement effects of a
tax position should initially be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on the technical
merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should initially and subsequently be measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with a taxing authority.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, as of January 1, 2007, we increased the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits by $2,420,000, increased deferred tax assets by $1,480,000 and reduced
retained earnings by $940,000. The total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1,
2007, amounted to $11,760,000, including interest and penalties.

See Note 9 for the FIN 48 tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits.


—

FSP AUG AIR-1

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FSP No. AUG AIR-1, “Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance
Activities” (FSP AUG AIR-1). This FSP amended certain provisions in the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Industry Audit Guide, “Audits of Airlines” (Airline Guide). The
Airline Guide is the principal source of guidance on the accounting for planned major maintenance
activities and it permits four alternative methods of accounting for such activities. This guidance
principally affects our accounting for periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels. Prior to
January 1, 2007, we applied the accrue-in-advance method as prescribed by the Airline Guide, which
allowed for the accrual of estimated costs for the next scheduled overhaul over the period leading
up to the overhaul. At the time of the overhaul, the actual cost of the overhaul was charged to the
accrual, with any deficiency or excess charged or credited to expense. FSP AUG AIR-1 prohibits the
use of the accrue-in-advance method, and was effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2006. Accordingly, we adopted this FSP effective January 1, 2007, and have elected to use the
deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance as prescribed by the Airline Guide and
permitted by FSP AUG AIR-1. Under the deferral method, the actual cost of each overhaul is
capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period until the next overhaul. Additionally, the
FSP must be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the earliest period presented in the
financial statements. As a result of the retrospective application of this change in accounting
principle, we have adjusted our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect using the
deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance.

FAS 158

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (FAS
158). We adopted the recognition provisions of FAS 158 as of December 31, 2006, and as a result,
recognized an increase to



our noncurrent prepaid pension asset of $8,949,000, an increase to our
noncurrent pension and postretirement liabilities of $11,844,000, an increase to deferred tax
assets of $1,107,000 and a charge to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income
of $1,788,000, net of tax. In addition to the recognition provisions, FAS 158 requires an employer
to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its year-end balance sheet.
This requirement was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. As noted above (see
caption 2008 — FAS 158), we adopted the measurement date provision effective January 1, 2008.

Note 19 Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In accordance with FAS 142, we classify purchased intangible assets into three categories: (1)
goodwill, (2) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization and (3) intangible assets
with indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized;
rather, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually. For additional information regarding
our policies on impairment reviews, see Note 1 under the captions Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment
and Impairment of Long-lived Assets Excluding Goodwill.

Goodwill

Goodwill is recognized when the consideration paid for a business combination (acquisition) exceeds
the fair value of the tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to
reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment.
Ongoing disruptions in the credit and equity markets and weak levels
of construction activity, underscored by the negative effects of the
prolonged global recession, prompted an increase in our discount rates, which reflect our estimated cost of
capital plus a risk premium. The results of our annual impairment
test performed as of January 1, 2009
indicated that the estimated fair value of our Cement reporting unit was less than the carrying
amount at that time. The estimated fair value was used in the second step of the impairment test as
the purchase price in a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the reporting unit’s assets and
liabilities. The carrying values of deferred taxes and certain long-term assets were adjusted to
reflect their estimated fair values as a result of the hypothetical purchase price allocation.

The residual amount of goodwill that resulted from this hypothetical purchase price allocation was
compared to the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit to determine if impairment
existed. Based on the preliminary results of this analysis, we estimated that the entire amount of
goodwill at this reporting unit was impaired as of December 31,
2008. As a result, we recorded a $252,664,000 ($227,581,000 net of tax benefit) noncash impairment charge.

The goodwill impairment charge is a noncash item and does not affect our operations, cash flow or
liquidity. Our credit agreements and outstanding indebtedness are not impacted by this noncash
impairment charge. The income tax benefit associated with this charge is substantially below our
normally expected income tax rate because the majority of the goodwill impairment relates to
nondeductible goodwill for federal income tax purposes.

There were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.



We have three reportable segments organized around our principal product lines: aggregates; asphalt
mix and concrete; and cement. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized below (in thousands of dollars):

The goodwill of acquired businesses for 2008 relates to the 2008 acquisitions (including exchanges) listed in Note 20. We are currently evaluating the final purchase price allocation for most of these acquisitions; therefore, the goodwill amount is subject to change. Approximately $25,015 thousand of the goodwill from the 2008 acquisitions is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are stated at their fair value, determined as
of the date of acquisition, less accumulated amortization, if applicable. These assets consist
primarily of contractual rights in place, noncompetition agreements favorable lease agreements
customer relationships and tradenames and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired individually or
otherwise obtained outside a business combination consist primarily of permitting, permitting
compliance and zoning rights and are stated at their historical cost, less accumulated
amortization, if applicable.

Historically, we have acquired intangible assets with only finite lives. Amortization of intangible
assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of
amortization that closely reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or
otherwise realized. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no charges for
impairment of intangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Intangible
assets are reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures

2008 Acquisitions and Divestitures

As a result of the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition, we entered into a Final Judgment with
the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that required us to divest nine
Florida Rock and Legacy Vulcan sites. During 2008, we completed the required divestitures. In a
transaction with Luck Stone Corporation, we divested two Florida Rock sites in Virginia, an
aggregates production facility and a distribution yard, by exchanging these assets for two
aggregates production facilities in Virginia and cash. In a transaction with Martin Marietta
Materials, Inc. (Martin Marietta), we divested four aggregates production facilities and a
greenfield (undeveloped) aggregates site located in Georgia, and an aggregates production facility
located in Tennessee. In return, we received cash, an aggregates production facility near
Sacramento, California, real property with proven and permitted reserves adjacent to one of our
aggregates production facilities in San Antonio, Texas, and fee ownership of property at one of our
aggregates production facilities in North Carolina that we had previously leased from Martin
Marietta. In a separate transaction, we sold our interest in an aggregates production facility in
Georgia to The Concrete Company, which had been the joint venture partner with Florida Rock in this
operation.



Two of the divested sites included in the transaction with Martin Marietta were owned by Vulcan
prior to our acquisition of Florida Rock. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2008, we
recognized a pretax gain of $73,847,000 on the sale of these assets.

In addition to the acquisitions in the aforementioned exchanges, during 2008, we acquired the
following assets for approximately $108,378,000 (total cash and stock consideration paid) including
acquisition costs and net of acquired cash:

•

an aggregates production facility in Illinois

•

four aggregates production facilities, one asphalt mix plant, a recycling facility and
vacant land in California

•

our former joint venture partner’s interest in an aggregates production facility in Tennessee

The acquisition payments reported above exclude contingent consideration not to exceed $3,000,000.
Upon resolution of the contingency, distributions to the seller, if any, will be considered
additional acquisition cost.

As a result of the acquisitions (including the exchanges), we recognized $30,565,000 of goodwill,
$25,015,000 of which is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes. The purchase price
allocations for these 2008 acquisitions are preliminary and subject to adjustment.

As of December 31, 2007, the assets and liabilities referable to the sites that we were required to
divest under the Final Judgment with the DOJ are classified as held for sale in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets under two captions: assets held for sale and liabilities of assets held
for sale. In accordance with SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived
Assets” (FAS 144), depreciation expense and amortization expense were suspended on assets held for
sale upon the November 16, 2007 acquisition. The major classes of assets and liabilities of assets
classified as held for sale are as follows (in thousands of dollars):

2007 Acquisitions and Divestitures

On November 16, 2007, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Florida Rock Industries,
Inc. (Florida Rock), a leading producer of construction aggregates, cement, concrete and concrete
products in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states, in exchange for cash and stock.

Under the terms of the agreement, Florida Rock shareholders had the right to elect to receive
either 0.63 of a share of Vulcan common stock or $67.00 in cash, without interest, for each share
of Florida Rock common stock that they owned. The elections were subject to proration so that, in
the aggregate, 70% of all outstanding shares of Florida Rock common stock were exchanged for cash
and 30% of all outstanding shares of Florida Rock common stock were exchanged for shares of Vulcan
common stock. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding Florida Rock stock
option, which fully vested prior to the effective time of the mergers, ceased to represent an
option to acquire shares of Florida Rock common stock and instead represented the right to receive
a cash amount equal to the excess, if any, of $67.00 per option to acquire one share of Florida
Rock common stock over the exercise price payable in respect of such stock option.



Based on the exchange ratio and proration provisions of the agreement, 12,604,083 shares of common
stock were issued to Florida Rock shareholders at a value of $1,436,487,000 (based on the average
closing share price, adjusted for dividends, of legacy Vulcan’s common stock during the four
trading days from February 15, 2007 through February 21, 2007, centered on the day the transaction
was announced). In addition, $3,212,609,000 in cash was paid in exchange for approximately 70% of
the outstanding common stock of Florida Rock, based on the proration provisions of the agreement,
and to fund the option consideration. Including Vulcan’s direct transaction costs of approximately
$29,237,000, total cash and stock consideration was recorded at $4,678,333,000. The results of
operations for Florida Rock are included in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings
for the year ending December 31, 2008 and the period from the November 16, 2007 closing date to
December 31, 2007.

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” the total cost of the acquisition was
allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values
as of November 16, 2007, with amounts exceeding the fair values recorded to goodwill. A final
allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition is presented below (in thousands of dollars):

As of the December 31, 2007 reporting date, we were in the process of obtaining third-party
valuations of certain property, plant & equipment and intangible assets. Due to the proximity of
the acquisition to our year end, the values of certain assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007
were based on preliminary valuations and were subject to adjustment as additional information was
obtained. Such additional information included, but was not limited to



valuations and physical
counts of certain property, plant & equipment and identification and valuation of intangible
assets. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed these valuations, which resulted in the
following adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation: an increase to property, plant
& equipment of $474,795,000 (principally real property, including depletable land); an increase to
intangible assets of $501,690,000 (principally contractual rights in place); an increase in
deferred income tax liabilities of $370,400,000 related to the increase in property, plant &
equipment and intangible assets; a decrease to goodwill of $596,180,000; and, a net decrease to
working capital items and other assets and liabilities of $10,010,000. Additionally, the purchase
price decreased $105,000 as a result of adjustments to our preliminary estimates of direct
transaction costs.

The $2,672,481,000 of goodwill that arose from this transaction reflected the value to Vulcan from:

•

Acquiring an established business with assets that have been assembled
over a very long period of time, the development of such assets in any
meaningful time frame would be virtually impossible, and the
collection of such assets can earn a higher rate of return than those
net assets could earn alone.

•

The synergies and other benefits created by combining our businesses,
including an expanded geographic footprint and enhanced presence in
several fast-growing markets, including the state of Florida.

•

Acquiring a talented, assembled workforce, particularly key management
personnel with extensive industry experience and knowledge and a
proven track record for strong cash flows and earnings growth.

As noted in detail above (2008 Acquisitions and Divestitures), the Florida Rock acquisition
resulted in our entering into a Final Judgment with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department
of Justice that required us to divest certain Florida Rock and Vulcan assets. These divestitures
were completed in 2008.

In addition to the Florida Rock acquisition, during 2007 we acquired the assets of the following
facilities for cash payments totaling approximately $58,872,000, including acquisition costs and
net of acquired cash:

•

an aggregates production facility in Illinois

•

an aggregates production facility in North Carolina

As a result of these two 2007 acquisitions, we recognized $31,301,000 of goodwill, all of which is
expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes.

Also, during 2007, we acquired an aggregates production facility in Alabama in exchange for two
aggregates production facilities in Illinois.

2006 Acquisitions

In 2006 we acquired the assets of the following facilities for cash payments totaling approximately
$20,481,000, including acquisition costs and net of acquired cash:

•

an aggregates production facility and asphalt mix plant in Indiana

•

an aggregates production facility in North Carolina

•

an aggregates production facility in Virginia

As a result of these 2006 acquisitions, we recognized $8,800,000 of goodwill and $5,146,000 of
amortizable intangible assets, all of which are expected to be fully deductible for income tax
purposes.

During 2006, we made cash payments of $50,000 for contingent consideration related to a 2005
acquisition.

Correction of Cash Flows from Operating Activities and Investing Activities

In preparation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, we
discovered an error in our reporting of cash flows from operating activities and investing
activities in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three, six and nine months ended March 31,
2008, June 30, 2008 and September 30, 2008, respectively. This error resulted from the
classification of certain noncash amounts associated with various swaps related to the Florida Rock
divestitures as cash paid for purchases of property, plant & equipment. The error solely affected
the classification of these amounts from cash used for investing activities to cash used for
operating activities in the affected Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, but
had no effect on net cash flows. In addition, the error had no effect on our Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets or Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the
periods ended March 31, 2008, June 30, 2008 and September 30, 2008. Accordingly, our total
revenues, net earnings, earnings per share, total cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, liquidity
and shareholders’ equity remain unchanged for the periods affected. Our compliance with any
financial covenants under our borrowing facilities was also not affected.

Subsequent 2009 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q will reflect the amounts reported for 2008
consistent with the “As Restated” amounts below. A summary of the effects of the correction of these
errors is as follows (in thousands of dollars):

Note 22 Subsequent Events

Debt Issuance

On January 23, 2009, we agreed to sell in a private placement $400,000,000 of long-term notes in
two related series (tranches), as follows: $150,000,000 of 10.125% coupon notes due December 2015
and $250,000,000 of 10.375% coupon notes due December 2018. The notes were sold to an initial
purchaser pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), as
amended, and subsequently resold to a qualified institutional buyer pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act. The notes were issued at discounts from par of $510,000 for the 2015 notes and
$1,830,000 for the 2018 notes. These discounts and the debt issuance costs of the notes will be
amortized using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the notes. The estimated
effective interest rates for these notes are 10.305% for the 2015 notes and 10.584% for the 2018
notes.

These issuances resulted in net proceeds on February 3, 2009 of $395,472,000, after deducting
underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs. We intend to use the proceeds to repay borrowings
outstanding under our short- or long-term debt obligations, including certain obligations maturing
in the first half of 2009, or for general corporate purposes.

Write-down of Pension Trust Assets

As of December 31, 2008, our Master Pension Trust had assets
invested at Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (WCM), an investment management firm, which utilizes WG
Trading Company, LP (WG), a futures trading firm, in its investment strategies. These investments
were reported by WCM to have a fair value of approximately
$59 million as of December 31, 2008, which represented
approximately 12.5% of the fair value of assets held in our Master
Pension Trust before the write-down described below.

On February 25, 2009, both the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filed separate actions in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New
York (NY District Court) against Paul Greenwood (Greenwood), Steven
Walsh (Walsh) and their affiliated entities, including WCM and WG, alleging fraud and other
violations of federal commodities and securities laws. The NY District
Court judge issued orders in both actions on February 25, 2009,
which among other things, freeze the defendants’ assets and
approve the appointment of a temporary receiver
over WCM, WG and affiliated entities. In addition, on February 25, 2009, the



U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
Southern District of New York announced parallel criminal charges
against Greenwood and Walsh.

In light of the pending civil and criminal actions,
we reassessed the fair value of our investments
at WCM and recorded a $48,018,000 write-down in the estimated fair value of these
assets in our Master Pension Trust. A charge of $28,970,000, net of
income tax of $19,048,000, was recorded in other comprehensive loss
for 2008. We estimated the amount of the write-down with the limited
information available at this time, and the amount of any actual loss
may differ materially from the amount recorded. We intend to pursue all appropriate legal actions to secure the return of our investments.

We
currently are assessing what, if any, impact this matter may have on the funded status of our
pension plans as determined under the Employer Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and
on required or discretionary employer contributions to our pension plans during 2009. We currently
estimate that the write-down of these assets may result in additional employer contributions to our
pension plans of up to approximately $9 million in 2009. This estimate is preliminary and actual employer
contributions, whether required under ERISA rules or discretionary, may differ materially from this
estimate.



Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a — 15(e) or 15d -15(e)), include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, with the participation of other management officials, evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2008. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal
control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of our
consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. Deloitte & Touche LLP’s report,
which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting, follows this report.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm — Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vulcan Materials Company and its
subsidiary companies (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on the criteria established in

Internal Control -
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of
the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 and our report dated March 2, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
