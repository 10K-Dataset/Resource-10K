ITEM 1

BUSINESS

Vulcan Materials Company is a New Jersey corporation and the nation’s

largest producer of construction aggregates:

primarily crushed stone,

san

d

and gravel.

We

operated

342 a

ggregates facilities

during 2013

. We also are a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed

concrete

as well as a leading producer of cement in Florida

.

VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION

We are

t

he leading construction materials business in the country with superior aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:

§

a

favorable geographic footprint that provides attractive long-term growth prospects

§

the

largest proven and probable reserve base

in the United States

§

oper

ational expertise and pricing disciplin

e p

rovid

ing

attractive unit profitability

STRATEGY FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS

§

Our

aggregates

reserves are strategically located throughout the United States i

n a

reas

that are projected to grow faster than the national average and

that require large amounts of aggregates to meet

construction

demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate


% of the total growth in U.S. population and


% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2010 and 2020. Our top ten revenue producing states in 201


were

Alabama

,

California

,

Florida

,

Georgia

,

Illinois

,

North Carolina

,

South Carolina

,

Tennessee, Texas

and

Virginia

.

Part I


Source: Moody’s Analytics as of November 21, 2013

§

We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow

more

rapidly and

by

divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 2013, we acquired

three aggregates production

facilities in fast-growing markets in Georgia and Texas

; added substantially to our reserves in

Georgia, Texas and

Virginia;

considerably improved our reserve position in California and commenced development of a major quarry in California. Conversely, we

divested non-strategic assets in Wisconsin.

§

W

here practical, we have operations located

close to our local markets because the cost of trucking

materials long distances is prohibitive.

Approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively

from the producing location to the customer

by truck, and another


%

are delivered by truck after reaching a

sales

yard by rail or water

.

The remaining 7% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

COMPETITORS

We operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies.

We estimate that the ten largest aggrega

tes producers account

ed

for approximately


% to


%

of to

tal U.S. aggregates production

in 2013

. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than


%.

O

ther publicly

traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

§

Cemex

S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH

plc

§

Heidelberg

Cement AG

§

Holcim

Ltd.

§

Lafarge

§

Martin Marietta Materials

, Inc.

§

MDU Resources

Group, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with

over

5,000

companies managing almost

9,000

operations

during 2013

, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by

acquiring existing facilities to

enter new markets or

by

extending

their

existing

market positions.

Part I


BUSINESS STRATEGY

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to

maintain and

expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in

most

types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and a

irports that connect us, and to

build the hospitals, churches,

schools,

shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy.

The following

graphs illustrate the relationship of our

four operating segments

to sales.

AGGREGATES-LED VALUE CREATION —


NET SALES

*Represents sales to external customers of our aggregates and our downstream products that use our aggregates.

Our business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4) tightly managed operational and overhead costs, and 5) effective land management.

§

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER

:

Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular

geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce

saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan

is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by

shipments

or by revenues.

The

342 ag

gregates

facilities

we operated during 2013

provide

d

opportunities to standardize

operating practices

and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in

an

efficient and cost-effective manner

,

both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service,

accounting,

accounts receivable and accounts payable, technical support and engineering.

Part I


2.

LARGE AND STRATEGICALLY LOCATED, COAST-TO-COAST

Demand for construction aggregates

correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly.

In 2013, we divested non-s

trategic assets in Wisconsin

;

increased our presence in fast-growing markets in Georgia

,

Texas

and Virginia; considerably improved our reserve position in California; and commenced development of a major quarry in California

PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our

long-term

growth is a result of

strategic

acquisition

s a

nd

investments in key operations

.

§

Strat

egic

acquisitions:

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California

and

Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and other southeastern and

m

id-Atlantic

states.

In addition to these large acquisitions, we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth.

§

Reinvestment opportunities with high returns

decade

,

Moody's Analytics projects

that


%

of

the U.S.

population growth

, 70% of household formation and 63% of new jobs

will

occur in Vulcan-served states. The close proximity of our production facilities and our aggregates reserves to this projected population growth crea

te ma

ny opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects that will add reserves, increase production capacity and improve

costs.

TIGHTLY MANAGED OPERATIONAL AND OVERHEAD COSTS

W

e

focus on

rigorous cost management throughout

the

economic cycl

e. Sm

all savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions. We are able to

adjust

production levels to meet

varying

market

conditions

without jeopardizing our ability to take advanta

ge of future increased demand.

Our knowledgeable and

experienced

workforce and our flexible production capabilities have allowed us to manage

operational and overhead

costs aggressively during the

prolonged

recession

in the construction industry

.

In 2012, we initiated a Profit Enhancement Plan that focused on

improving profitability through more effective

sourcing,

reducing

general & administrative

expenses

and

improving

transportation/logistics

programs

. W

e also reorganized our company structure

in 2012

enabling us to make significant reductions in our

Selling, Administrative and General (

SAG

)

expense.

In addition to cost reduction steps taken in previous years, in 201


we

continued to control costs aggressively in our operation

s.

As a result of these cost controls coupled with a disciplined approach to pricing

, our cash

gross profit

for each ton of aggregates sold in 201


was


%

higher than at the peak of demand in 2005

(refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for Non-GAAP disclosures)

.

Part I


5.

LA

ND MANAGEMENT

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning

because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future.

PRODUCT LINES

We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines:

1.

Aggregates

2.

Concrete

3.

Asphalt Mix

4.

Cement

1. AGGREGATES

A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our busines

s, i

ncluding markets,

the location and quality of

reserves and demand cycles.

§

Local markets:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases,

are

produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the material

s, r

endering

them

uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials.

Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets fro

m q

uarries

that have access to long-haul transportation

— shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.

§

Diverse markets

:

Large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public- and private-sector

construction project

s, su

ch as highways, airports, water and sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast.

§

Location and quality of reserves:

We

currently ha

ve

15.0

billion

tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Such growth

depends on

aggregates for construction. Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restrictions could curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also could increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

§

Demand cycles:

Long-term growth in

demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak esta

blishing a new historical

high.

Part I


I

n addition, the following factors influence the aggregates market:

§

Highly fragmented industry:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of

over

5,000

companies that manage almost

9,000

operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for

consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

Relatively stable demand from the public sector

:

Publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable

and less cyclical

than privately funded construction

,

and

generally

requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically

is

more affected by general

economic cycles than

p

ublicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges

), w

hich

tend to

receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

§

Limited product substitution:

T

here are

limited

substitutes for quality aggregates.

R

ecycled concrete

and asphalt have

certain

applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However,

due to technical specifications

many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concre

te,

but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities

.

Moreover,

the amount of

recycled asphalt

included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates

is limited

due

to

specifications

.

§

Widely used in downstream products:

In the production process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses. Two products that use aggregates

as a raw material

are asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise

approximately

95%

of asphalt mix and

78%

of ready-mixed concrete.

§

Flexible production capabilities:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

raw material inputs

largely under our control

:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric

power.

AGGREGATES

MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with

above-average

long-term

expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or

have

access to economical transportation

via rail, barge or ship

to

a particular end market

. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

Part I


PUBLIC SECTOR

CONSTRUCTION

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways,

bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and

private sources. In 2013

, publicly funded construction

accounted for

approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments.

§

Public Sector Funding:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal

surface

transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two decades,

a portion of transportation

projects ha

s

been funded through a series of multi-year bills.

Some 40% of transportation projects are federally-funded, with special emphasis given to the largest and most complex projects.

The long-term aspect of these bills is

important

because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-

range

, com

plex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This

T

rust

Fund

receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 201


,

approximately


%

of

our aggregates sales by volume

was

used in highway construction projects.

§

federal highway funding

:

In June 2012, Congress passed

the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act (

MAP-21

)

, a new multi-year highway bill. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation in both the House and the Senate, and it was signed into law by the President on July 6, 2012.

MAP-21

has provided state departments of transportation with the funding certainty to move forward on infrastructure programs, and it helps rebuild America’s aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.

MAP-21 maintains essentially level f

unding through Fiscal Year 201

4, w

ith approximately $105 billion of total funding. It extends the Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through Fiscal Year 2016, adding additional stability to the Federal Highway Program. The

act’s

substantial highway provisions are more reform-focused than previous bills, with a strong emphasis on improving project delivery and eliminating red tape that has slowed the construction of highway projects

.

Funding directly for highways has provided a floor of $82 billion for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014.

In addition,

MAP-21 provides a

significant increase in

funding for

the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Funding for this program will increase to $1.75 billion over the two-year period of this

act,

from $122 million per year under the previous multi-year highway bill. TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates this TIFIA funding will support $30 to $50 billion in new construction. However, given administrative requirements and other factors, it is

difficult to predict

the timing of shipments for

TIFIA

projects

.

TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United States, including

large portions of our footpri

nt.

The program provides

low-cost

credit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects

for up to 49% of a project’s estimated cost. Repayment terms are generous and at favorable interest

rates. Eligible

sponsors for TIFIA projects include state and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multi-modal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. We are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of TIFIA-funded projects.

Overall, MAP-21 creates a positive framework for future authorizations through its significant reforms, consolidating and simplifying federal highway programs, accelerating the project delivery process, expanding project financing and promoting public-private partnership opportunities. The fact that Congress was able to pass the bill given the political climate in Washington, maintaining funding levels while also adding an additional year of program funding beyond what  was expected, has its own significance and has contributed to our optimism about the ability of Congress to continue to work towards long-term solutions that will rebuild America’s infrastructure.

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

:

Congress is currently working to complete the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which will provide legal authority for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with major planned improvements on hundreds of navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration infrastructure projects along rivers, canals, ports and inland waterways throughout the nation. In 2013, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate both passed versions of the bill with sweeping majorities. Negotiators from each chamber are currently working to produce a conference report that could pass both chambers and go to the president for his signature. We, along with our business allies, have been strong supporters of the WRDA bill given its overall importance to the U.S. economy, and the pressing

Part I


need to make material improvements to America’s harbors, ports and inland waterways, which are extensively used by us and our customers. The final bill is expected to address a significant backlog of water infrastructure projects, help enable improved dredging at certain ports, and speed up permitting in order to improve the pace of project completion. Many of the large southern ports that would benefit from WRDA, as they gear up for expected increases in freight volumes with the expansion of the Panama Canal, lie within our footprint. Additionally, both the House and Senate bills introduce new innovative public-private financing opportunities; the Senate's proposal is modeled after the Highway program's TIFIA program and is called WIFIA (Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act). It seeks to fund large projects exceeding $25 million that are otherwise unachievable. Further, as with TIFIA, it provides funding for up to 49% of a project's estimated cost, involves low interest rates, and includes favorable repayment terms as well as subrogation of the government's interest in order to encourage other investors.

Private sector

CONSTRUCTION

The private sector

construction

market

s i

nclude both nonresidential building

construction

and residential construction and

are

considerably

more cyclical than public construction. In 201


, privately-funded construction accounted

for

approximately


%

of our

total aggregates shipments.

§

Nonresidential Construction:

Private nonresidential

building

construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction

.

Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally

is

driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

C

ontract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for

aggrega

tes. Af

ter bottoming in 2010, trailing twelve-month contract awards for private nonresidential buildings began to improve in 2011, ending the year up 16% from 2010 levels. In 2012, private nonresidential building awards grew another 14%, which was entirely attributable to strength in contract awards for stores and office buildings, up 34% and 17%, respectively

. In 2013,

contract awards, as measured in square feet, increased for the third year in a row. Total private nonresidential contract awards were up approximately 5 million square feet, or 11%. Stores and office buildings again accounted for all of this growth, up 19% and 20%, respectively.

Employment

gro

wth, att

ractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive

continued

growth in construction activity in this end market.

§

Residential Construction:

The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in

our m

arkets

continue to outpace household formations in

the

rest of the

U.S.

Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage

financing.

U.S.

housing starts, as measured by McGraw-Hill data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.

In 2013, total

annual

housing starts

increased to

951,000

unit

s.

The growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS

We sell

aggregates that are used as

balla

st fo

r construction and maintenance of railroad track

s

. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along

roads and

waterways.

In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use

limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a

fine powder can be sold as

agricultural lime.

We

sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "

2.

CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in

California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia

and the Bahamas

.

Additionally, we produce and sell, in a limited number of these markets, other concrete products such as block

.

We also resell purchased building materials for use with ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising

approximately

78%

by

weight of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment almost wholly through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility.

Ready-

mixed concrete production also requires cement. In

the

Florida

market, cement requirements for ready-mixed concrete production

were

mostly

supplie

d b

y our Cement segment. In other markets, we purchase cement from third-

party suppliers. We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

Part I


3. ASPHALT MIX

We produce and sell asphalt mix

in

Arizona, California, and Texas

. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately

95%

by weight

of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt

M

ix segment almost wholly through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery

typically is within close proximity

to the producing facility.

The asphalt

mix

production process requires liquid asphalt

cement

, which we purchas

e fr

om third-party producers.

We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

We serve our Asphalt

M

ix segment customers from our local production facilities.

4. CEMENT

Our Newberry, Florida cement plant produces Portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete products industry. Our Tampa, Florida

distribution

facility can import and export cement and slag.

Cement can be

resold, blended, bagged, or reprocessed into specialty cements that we then sell.

The slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended

form. The

Cement segment’s largest single customer is our own ready-mixed concrete operations within the Concrete segment.

Ou

r Brooksville, Florida calcium plant produces calcium products for the animal feed, paint, plastics, water treatment and joint compound industries. This facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville

quarry.

An expansion of production capacity at our Newberry, Florida cement plant was completed in 2010. Total annual production capacity is

1.6

million tons per year.

This plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility.

As of December 31, 2013, t

hese limestone reserves

total

ed

188.6

milli

on tons.

In Januar

y 2

014, we entered into an agreement to sell our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area to Cementos Argos. We will retain our Cement segment’s calcium operation in Brooksville. The transaction is expected to close

in the first quarter of 2014.

For additional details see Note 21 “Subsequent Events” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

OTHER BUSINESS

-

RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all

of

our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart

er. Fu

rthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.

Part I


CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business

depends

upon any

single

customer whose loss would have

a significant

adverse effect on our business. In 201


, ou

r f

ive

largest

customers accounted

for

4.8

%

of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than

1.1

%

of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately

45% to 55%

of our

aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to

numerous

federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the

environment and

worker

health and saf

ety;

examples include

regulation of

facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both

Mine Safety and Health Administration (

MSHA

)

and

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (

OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs.

We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201


and 201


will be approximately

$

10.6

million and $

22.7

million, respectively

. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have

a

material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents,

registered

trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.

ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment.

The following is a list of our risk factors.

EC

ONOMIC/POLITICAL RISKS

b

oth commercial and residential construction are dependent upon the overall U.S. economy which

is

recovering at a slow pace

—

Commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles. When the economy is strong, construction levels rise and when the economy is weak, construction levels

fall. The

U.S. economy is

recovering from the recession, but

the pace of recovery

is

slow. Since construction activity generally lags the recovery after down cycles, construction projects have not returned to their pre-

recession levels.

Changes

in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures

—

Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations

are subject to environmental, zoning and land use requirements and

require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capit

al an

d operating

expenditures to comply with

the applicable requirements.

Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities.

Climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business

—

A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a "cap and trade" system of allowances and credits

or a carbon tax

, among other provisions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The EPA has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule, referred to as the "Tailoring Rule

,

" which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the Federal Clean Air Act. We have determined that our Newber

r

y cement plant is subject to both the reporting rule and the permitting rule, although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time. The first required greenhouse gas emissions report for the Newberry cement plant w

as

submitted to the EPA

on

March 31, 2011.

Other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity.

The impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate chang

e, l

egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position,

results of operations or

cash flows.

Part I


GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs

—

The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are

significantly

vertically integrate

d.

Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices

and

lower sales volum

es in

some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash

flows.

Our

long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our earnings in the future

—

Construc

-

tion aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the

products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry si

tes often take years to develop

;

therefore

,

our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.

Our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings

—

The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results w

ill depend i

n part on our ability

to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.

FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS

Our

industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume

—

Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates,

our profits and profit margins are

negatively affected by

significant

decreases in volume.

Uneve

n r

ecovery in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill

—

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair

value

of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 20



tha

t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value, the timing of a sustained recovery in the construction industry may have a significant effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of

goodwill.

We incurred considerable short-term and long-term debt to finance the Florida Rock merger. This additional debt significantly increased our interest expense and debt service requirements

—

The combination of this debt and our reduced operating cash flow over the last several years produced substantially higher financial leverage that has resulted in credit rating downgrades.

Our operating cash flow is burdened by substantial annual interest, and in some years, principal payments. Our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments, or to refinance the maturing principal of debt, depends on our operating and financial performance. The ability to refinance maturing principal is also dependent upon the state of the capital markets. Operating and financial performance is, in turn, subject to general economic and business conditions, many of which are beyond our control

.

Our debt instruments contain various reporting and financial covenants, as well as affirmative covenants (e.g., requirement to maintain proper insurance) and negative covenants (e.g., restrictions on lines of business). If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, the related debt could become due prior to its stated maturity, and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing could be

impaired.

Part I


We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results

—

As discussed more fully in "Critical Accounting Policies" under Item


"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," we use significant

judgment in accounting for

:

§

g

oodwill and goodwill impairment

§

impairment of long-

lived assets excluding goodwill

§

reclamation

costs

§

pension and other postretirement benefits

§

environmental

compliance

§

claims and liti

gation including self-insurance

§

income taxes

We believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates; however, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and

could adversely affect our financial position

, results of operations, or cash flows.

PERSONNEL RISKS

Our business depends on a successful succession

plan

—

As a number of our long-serving top executives approach retirement age, effective succession planning has become very important to our long-term success.

The Governance and Management Succession Committee of

o

ur Board of Directors

as well as the full Board routinely reviews and updates the Company's management succession plan.

In December 2013, we announced several leadership changes, effective January 1, 2014, in furtherance of our management succession plan.

Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Additionally, this change in management may be disruptive to our business and during the transition period there may be uncertai

nty among investors, vendors, customers and others concerning our future direction and performance.

Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations

—

A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit

packages.

OTHER

RISKS

Weather can materially affect our operating results

—

Almost all of our products are

consumed outdoors

in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ short-term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather. Therefore, our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather.

Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings

—

Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets.

The c

osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability

—

In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors

that

interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability.

Part I


We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in several

complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals

and Metals

business

es

. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of

operations or cash flows. For a description

of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12

"

Commitments and Contingencies

"

in Item 8

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

We are involved in certain

environmental

matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal, primarily in connection with our divested Chemicals and Metals businesses. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant environmental matters see Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

ITEM 1B

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We have not received any written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act of 1934 that remain unresolved.

ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

AGGREGATES

As the largest U.S. producer of construction aggregates, we have operating facilities across the U.S. and in Mexico and the

Bahamas. We principally serve mark

ets in


sta

tes, the District of Columbia and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the U.S. that are expected

to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates.

Our current estimate of

15.0

billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve

s i

s

consistent with the prior year’s

level

.

Estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers, recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and subject to permit or other restrictions.

Part I


Proven, or measured, reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data, together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops, trenches and quarry faces. The grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling, and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. Probable, or indicated, reserves are those reserves for which quantity and grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable, though not drilled, geologic evidence. The degree

of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation

.

Reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease, and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained. Leases, zoning, permits, reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas, depths and lengths of time allowed for mining, stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place, and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities, berms, and overburden or

waste storage, among other requirements and restrictions. Our reserve estimates take into account these factors. Technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis. For example, excessive overburden or weathered rock, rock quality issues, excessive mining depths, groundwater issues, overlying wetlands, endangered species habitats, and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable. In addition, computations for reserves in-place are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste.

The

15.0

billion tons of estimated

proven and probable

aggregates reserves reported at the end of



and


i

nclude reserves at inactive and greenfield (undeveloped)

sites. The

table below presents, by

region

, the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of December 31, 201


and the types of facilities operated.


In addition to the facilities included in the table above, we operate


recrushed concrete plants which are not dependent on reserves.


The regions are defined by states as follows: Central region – Illinois, central Kentucky and Tennessee; East region – Delaware, central Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and the District of Columbia; South region – Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, south Georgia, western Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, the Bahamas and Mexico; and West region – Arizona and California.


Includes a maximum of

395.9

million tons of reserves encumbered

by vo

lumetric production payment

s

as defined in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" caption “Deferred Revenue” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Of the

15.0

billion tons of aggregates reserves

at December 31, 2013

,

8.6

billion tons or


%

are located on owned land and

6.4

billion tons or


%

are located on leased land.

Part I


The following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites. None of our aggregates facilities, other than Playa del Carmen, contributed more than


% to our net sales in 2013.

ASPHALT MIX, CO

NC

RETE AND CEMENT

We also operate a number of facilities

producing other products

in several of our

Regions:


Central Region has no asphalt mix, concrete or cement facilities.


Includes ready-mixed concrete, concrete block and other concrete products facilities.


Includes one cement manufacturing facility, one cement import terminal and a

ground

calcium plant.

The asphalt mix and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials.

Our Cement segment operates

a

limestone

quarr

y

in

Newberry,

Florida which provide

s

our cement production facility with feedstock materials

and a quarry at Brooksville, Florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation

.

Our Newberry limestone quarry is mined primarily as feedstock for our wholly-owned cement production facility. The p

rocess of making cement

requires raw materials including

high purity limestone

to ac

hieve the chemical reactions that generate the final prod

uct. The

Newberry limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate (CaCO


) content of 97.0%.

Our Brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for end-use products such as animal feed, plastics and paint. High purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these end-use produc

ts. The

Brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate (CaCO


) content of 98.1%.

and

strengthen

our credit profile:

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

We believe economic and construction-related fundamentals that drive demand for our products are continuing to improve from the historically low levels created by the economic downturn. Growth in the private construction end markets, particularly residential, continued to drive increased construction activity and demand for our products in 2013. We have seen significant growth in housing starts in Vulcan-served states such as Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas. Additionally, leading indicators of private nonresidential construction are continuing to improve.

Highway construction is the largest end market for aggregates demand within public construction. Recent growth in highway construction provides evidence that a more stable and predictable highway funding environment leads to improving construction activity. Future demand should also be positively impacted by the large increase in Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) funding contained in the federal highway bill,

MAP-21.

UNSOLICITED EXCHANGE OFFER

In December 2011, Martin Marietta commenced an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstanding shares of our common sto

ck. Aft

er careful consideration, including a thorough review of the offer with its financial and legal advisors, our Board unanimously determined that Martin Marietta’s offer

wa

s inadequate, substantially undervalu

ed

Vulcan,

had substantial execution risk,

and

therefore

wa

s not in the best interests of Vulcan and its shareholder

s.

In May 2012, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that Martin Marietta had breached two confidentiality agreements between the companies, and enjoined Martin Marietta for a period of four months from pursuing its exchange offer for our shares, prosecuting its proxy contest, or otherwise taking steps to acquire control of our shares or assets and from any further violations of the two confidentiality agreements between the parties.

As a result of the court ruling, Martin Marietta withdrew its exchange offer and its board nominees.

In response to Martin Marietta’s action, we incurred legal, professional and other costs of $

43.4

million

in 2012 and $

2.2 million

in

2011.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) does not define "free cash flow

,

"

"cash gross profit"

and "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization

”

(EBITDA). Thus,

free cash flow

should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity

measure

defined by GAAP

. Likewise, cash gross profit

and

EBITDA should not be considered as

alternatives

to earnings measures defined by GAAP

. We present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyse

s a

nd for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions. The investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company's ability to incur and service debt

and to assess the operating performance of a company’s businesses

. We use free cash flow,

cash gross profit,

EBITDA and other such measures to assess

liquidity and

the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company.

Additionally, we adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period and provide the earnings per share impact of these adjustments for the convenience of the investment community.

We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources

.

Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below:

HIGHLIGHTS

OPERATING

LEVERAGE IN

OUR BUSINESS

The strong recovery in 2013's gross profit demonstrates the operating

leverage in

our business as demand recovers. We expect this momentum to continue in 2014 due primarily to an improving demand environment, continued improvement in pricing and our continued focus on managing costs. We remain

committed to

building leading aggregates positions in markets with above average long-term demand growth. As we look ahead to 2014, the operating leverage in our aggregates business sets the stage for even stronger earnings growth and cash generation as volumes continue to grow.

We completed several transactions in 201


that provided $

wer

e $

24.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $52.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share in 2012. Earnings improved

partially

as a result of volume growth in each of our operating segments. Our disciplined approach to pricing and effective cost control also positively impacted earnings.

Additionally, each year's results were impacted by discrete items as follows:

Aggregates segment gross profit

increased $61.2 million from the prior year and gross profit margin as a percentage of segment revenues increased 1.4 percentage points (140 basis points). The increase in Aggregates segment gross profit resulted from higher volumes and higher selling prices slightly offset by

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities, a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets. Additional

sources of liquidity

liquidity and

financial resources are sufficient to fund our future business requirements, including:

§

cash contractual obligations

§

capital expenditures

§

debt service obligations

§

potential future acquisitions

§

dividend payments

We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:

§

maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity

§

use the bank line of credit only for seasonal working capital requirements and other temporary funding requirements

§

proactively manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low

§

avoid financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility

§

opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable

Net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization.

2013 versus 2012

—

Net cash provided by operating activities of $

million

in

creased $

2013 VERSUS 2012

—

Net cash

used for

investing activities

in

creased $

306.6

million in 201


. This

in

crease resulted from

a $272.0 million increase in the purchase of property, plant & equipment and businesses and a $32.8 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses. During 2013, we acquired three aggregates production facilities and four ready-mixed concrete facilities for approximately $90.0 million

and land containing 136 million tons of reserves for $117.0 million

. We also sold five aggregates production facilities, one replacement reserve site and reclaimed land associated with a former site of a ready-mixed concrete facility for approximately $51.1 million. These transactions are consistent with our strategic focus on disposing non-core assets and building aggregates positions in markets with above average long-term demand growth.

2012 VERSUS 2011

—

Net cash provided by investing activities increased $29.9 million in 2012. This increase resulted from an increase in

proceeds from

divestitures

of non-core assets

(a $13.6 million year-over-year increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and businesses) and a decrease in

spending for acquisitions

(a $16.1 million year-over-year decrease in purchases of property, plant & equipment and businesses). These divestitures

(as outlined in Note 19 "Acquisition and Divestitures" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data")

2013 VERSUS 2012

—

Net cash used for financing activities

of $142.0 million in

creased $

12.8

million in 2013 compared to 2012.

This increase in cash used for financing activities is attributable to a $15.


million increase

in de

bt payments. During 2013, we made scheduled debt payments of $10.0 million in January to retire the 8.70% medium-term note and $140.4 million in June to retire the 6.30% notes.

2012 VERSUS 2011

—

Net cash used for financing activities increased $87.9 million in 2012 compared to 2011. In 2011, we restructured our debt portfolio which generated $24.8 million of net cash proceeds. In 2012, we paid $134.8 million of debt as scheduled. This decrease in cash flows related to debt was partially offset by $93.0 million in cash savings derived from the decrease in dividend payments (2012

—

$0.04 per share, 2011

—

$0.76 per share).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1

"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

"

in Item 8

"

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.

We believe the

following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

1.

Goodwill and goodwill impairment

2.

Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

3.

Reclamation costs

4.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

5.

Environmental compliance

6.

Claims and litigation including self-insurance

7.

GOODWILL AND

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 201


, goodwill represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management

judgment.

H

OW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill is tested for imp

airment

one level below our operating segments (reporting unit). W

e have identified


reporting units, of which 9 carry goodwil

l. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

STEP 1

We compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill

:

§

if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired

§

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any

STEP 2

We compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair valu

e representing implied goodwill:

§

if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

Part I

I


HOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE

First, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. Then, we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach, which involves discounting estimated future cash flows, and a market

approach, which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies

. Finally, we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. To substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations, we reconcile the implied fair values to our market capitalization.

O

UR ASSUMPTIONS

We base our fair value estimates on

market participant

assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results. These conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.

RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS

The results of our annual impairment tests for:

§

November 1, 2013 indicated

that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded

(by greater than 25%)

their carrying values

§

November 1, 201


indicated that the fair values of

all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded

(by greater than 25%)

their carrying values

§

November 1, 2011 indicated that the fair values of

one of our reporting units with $1,815.1 million of goodwill exceeded its carrying value by

8%

. The fair values of all other

reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values

(see further discussion below)

The key assumptions used in

our 2011

discounted cash flows (DCF) model of the aggregates reporting unit for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by 8% were growth rates for volume, price and variable costs to produce, capital requirements and the discount rate. Based on our historical experience and macroeconomic forecasts for each of the counties that are served by our operations, we developed projections for volume, price and cost growth rates. Subsequently, projections were revised downwards to reflect assumptions that we believe a market participant, not privy to our internal information, would make based on information available through normal and customary due diligence procedures. Accordingly, the DCF model assumes that over a twenty year projection period volumes, pricing and variable cost grow at inflation-adjusted (real) average annual rates of 4.8%, 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Our capital spending assumptions are based on the level of projected volume and our historical experience. For goodwill impairment testing purposes, we utilized a 9.50% discount rate to present value the estimated future cash flows.

The market approach was based on multiples of revenue and EBITDA to enterprise value for comparative public companies. The six data points (derived from the revenue and EBITDA multiples for the past three years, trailing twelve months and analysts’ estimates for next year) were averaged to arrive at the estimated fair value of the reporting

unit.

For

additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 18 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in Item 8 "Financial Statements

a

nd Supplementary Data."

Part I

I


2. IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of December 31, 201


,

net

p

roperty, plant & equipment

represents


% of total assets, while

net

other intangible assets

represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judg

ment. Th

e carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets.

Fair value is determined primarily

by

using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we

test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g. ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates and cement) determines the profitability of the downstream business.

We recorded no asset impairments during 2013.

During 2012, we recorded a $2.0 million loss on impairment of long-lived assets. This impairment loss

related primarily to

assets classified as held for sale (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

”).

Long

-lived asset impairments during 201


were immaterial

and related to property abandonments

.

We maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations. These assets

totaled $

349.8

million at December 31, 201


, representing an approximate


%

in

crease from December 31, 201


. Of the total

$

349.8

million

,

approximately


%

relates

to re

al estate held for future development and expansion of o

ur op

erations. An additional


%

is comprised of real estate (principally former mining sites) pending development as commercial or residential real estate, reservoirs or landfills. The remaining


%

is composed of aggregates, ready-mix

ed concrete

and asphalt mix operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products.

Of this

remaining

40% of temporarily idled assets,

$

15.6

million

is composed of assets that we anticipate selling in the first quarter of 2014 (see Note 21 “Subsequent Events” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).

We anticipate moving

the remaining

idled assets back into operation as demand recovers. We evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Note 4 "Property, Plant & Equipment" and Note 18 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in Item 8 "Financial

Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

3. RECLAMATION COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

Reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates, assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations ($

228.2

million as of December 31, 201


and $15


.


million as of December 31, 201


).

Part I

I


HOW WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Note 17 "Asset Retirement Obligations" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

4. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

§

DISCOUNT RATE

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future

§

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

— We project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs

§

RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE

— For salary-related plans only, we project employees' annual pay increases

through 2015

, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement

§

RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE

BENEFITS

— We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits

HOW WE SET OUR ASSUMPTIONS

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. We also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high-quality bonds. At December 31, 201


, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from

3.80

% to

5.15

%

(December 31, 201


ranged from

3.05

% to

4.35

%).

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 201


, the expected return on plan assets

remained at 7.50%

.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience and future expectations. At December 31, 201


, our projected weighted-average rate of compensation

increase remained at 3.50%

.

In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 201


, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits

remained at

7.50

% for 201


, decreasing each year until reaching

5.0


% in 20


and remaining level thereafter.

Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost. The following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions:

As of the December 31,



measurement date, the fair value of our pension plan assets

in

creased from $6

83.1

million to $

756.6

million du

e t

o

favorable investment returns

.

No

contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 201


.

During 201


, we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately $

7.3

million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately $

2.1

million compared to $

37.1

million and $

2.6

million, respectively, in 201


. The

de

crease in pension expense is due

in part

to

a plan change announced in March 2013 which ceased future accruals for salaried pension participants beyond

2013. We

do not anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 201


. However, we anticipate making a $4.1 million discretionary contribution to the plans.

We currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 "Benefit Plans" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

5. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

COSTS

To account for environmental

costs

, we:

§

expense or capitalize environmental

costs consistent

with our capitalization policy

§

expense

costs

for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues

§

accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost

At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 201


, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $

3.9

million.

Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates, including key assumptions, for accruing environmental compliance costs; however, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 "Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

6. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program

. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $2.0 million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $3.0 million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention

levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.

HOW WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS

We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

For additional information regarding claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.

7. INCOME TAXES

HOW WE DETERMINE OUR

CURRENT AND

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

We file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns, including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries. We account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met

hod. Sign

ificant judgments and estimates are required in determining

our

current and deferred

tax

assets and liabilities

, which reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay

.

These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement

’s

carrying amounts

of assets and liabilities

and the

amounts used for income tax purposes

. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns

. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9 “Income Taxes” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

On an annual basis, we perform a

comprehensive

analysis of all forms of positive and negative evidence based on year end results. During each interim period, we update our annual analysis for significant changes in the positive and negative evidence.

At December 31, 201


, we identified the following forms of negative evidence:

§

we

are

in a cumulative loss position based on financial results for the trailing

three

years (our foreign operations were profitable during this period, but not to the extent

necessary

to overcome the

cumulative

loss position)

§

certain of our deferred tax assets

are

carryforwards and

have

a relatively brief period before expiration (see table

below)

§

the

aggregate

s

industry

has

not fully recovered from the most recent economic

downturn

The

amount

of our definite-lived deferred

tax asset carryforwards at December 31, 2013, along with their expiration periods

,

is listed below:

The

first

transaction described in Note 21 “Subsequent Events” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” is significant new positive evidence and will provide sufficient taxable income to support the realization of:

§

our charitable contribution carryforwards

§

the majority of our foreign tax credit carrryforwards

§

our federal net operating loss carryforwards

§

a portion

of our state net operating loss carryforwards

The realization of the remaining balance of our deferred tax assets is supported by the future reversals of our existing temporary differences and the anticipated future earnings from our foreign operations.

Based on the following reasons,

our state net operating loss carryforwards require additional consideration:

§

the required filing groups in many states are different from the federal filing group

§

certain states have brief expiration periods or other limitations on the utilization of net operating loss

carryforwards

§

we no longer file in certain states for which we have net operating loss carryforwards

Part I

I


Based on this analysis, we have provided

a valuation allowance of $

46.3

million

, an increase of $7.5 million from the prior year valuation allowance,

against our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforward

s. O

f the $

46.3

million valuation allowance, $

44.7

million relate

s

to

our

Alabama net operating los

s c

arryforward. The remaining valuation allowance of $

1.6

million relate

s

to other state net operating los

s c

arryforwa

rds.

I

f

we

later

determine that

realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance will be reduc

ed. Con

versely, if we determine that

it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase the valuation allo

wance.

FOREIGN EARNINGS

U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore.

At least annually, we e

valuate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore

.

UNRECOGNIZ

ED TA

X BENEFITS

We recognize

a ta

x benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained

based upon the technical merits of the position

. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure th

e t

ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realiz

ed. Ou

r liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. Our income tax provision includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x

benefits.

The

years open

to

tax

examinations

vary

by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is

adequate.

We

consider an

issue to

be resolved

at the earlier of

the issue being “effectively settled,”

settlement of an examination

,

or

the expiration of the statute of limitati

ons. Upon resolution, unrecognized tax benefits will be reversed as a discrete event.

Ou

r liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits as income tax expense.

STATUTORY DEPLETION

Our largest permanent item in computing both our

taxable income and

effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9 "Income Taxes" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. In order to manage or reduce these market risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

We are exposed to interest rate risk due to our bank line of credit and other long-term debt instruments. At times, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk.

At

December 31, 201


, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt instruments including current maturities was $

2,820.6

million compared to a book value of $

2,522.4

million. The estimated fair value was determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on credit-adjusted interest rates on U.S. Treasury bills, notes or bonds, as appropriate. The fair value estimate is based on information available as of the measurement date. Although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount, it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date. The effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our liability by $

133.2

million.

We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high-quality bonds, the expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits. The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section of this

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for

each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to

express an opinion on the financial statement

s b

ased on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of

the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Vulcan Materials Company (the "Company," "Vulcan," "we," "our"), a New Jersey corporation, is the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates, primarily

crushed stone, sand and gravel

and

a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed

concrete.

Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as

described

in Note 2, the operating results of the Chemicals business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vulcan Materials Company and all our majority or

wholly-owned subsidiary companies. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Costs associated with restructuring our operations include severance

and related

charges to eliminate a specified number of employee positions, costs to relocate employees, contract cancellation costs and charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations. Relocation and contract cancellation costs and charges to vacate facilities are recognized in the period the liability is incurred. Severance charges for

employee

s w

ho

are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, generally more than 60 days, are recognized ratably over the retention period; otherwise, the full severance charge is recognized on the date a detailed restructuring plan has been authorized by management and communicated to employees.

In 2011, we substantially completed the implementation of

a

multi-year project to replace our legacy information technology systems

with new ERP and Shared Services platforms.

These platforms

are

help

ing

us streamline processes enterprise-wide and standardize administrative and support functions while providing enhanced flexibility to monitor and control costs. L

everaging this significant investment in technology allowed us to reduce overhead and administrative staff

. Additionally, in December 2011,

our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to consolidate our eight divisions into

four regions

as part of an ongoing effort to reduce overhead costs and increase operating efficiency.

As a result of these two restructuring plans, we recognized $12,971,000 of severance and related charges in

2011. There

were no significant charges related to these restructuring plans in 2012 and 2013.

In 2012, our Board approved a Profit Enhancement

Plan

that further leverages our streamlined management structure and substantially completed ERP and Shared Services platforms to achieve cost reductions and other earnings enhancements. During 2013 and 2012, respectively, we incurred

$1,509,000

and

$9,557,000

of costs (primarily project design, outside advisory and severance) related to the implementation of this plan.

We do not expect to incur any future material

charges

related to this Profit Enhancement Plan.

XCHANGE OFFER

COSTS

In December 2011, Martin Marietta

Materials, Inc. (Martin Marietta)

commenced

an unsolicited

exchange

offer for all

outstanding shares of our common

stock and

indicated its intention to nominate

a slate of directors to our Boar

d.

After careful consideration, including a thorough review of the offer with its financial and legal advisors, o

ur

Board

unanimously determined that Martin Marietta’s

offer wa

s inadequate, substantially undervalue

d

Vulcan

,

wa

s not in the best interests of Vulcan and its shareholders

and had substantial risk.

In May 2012, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that Martin Marietta had breached two confidentiality agreements between the companies, and enjoined Martin Marietta through September 15, 2012 from pursuing its exchange offer for our shares, prosecuting its proxy contest, or otherwise taking steps to acquire control of our shares or assets and from any further violations of the two confidentiality agreements between the parties.

As a result of the court ruling, Martin Marietta withdrew its exchange offer and its board nominees.

In response to Martin Marietta’s action

s

,

we incurred

legal

,

professional and other costs as follows:



—

$43,380,000

and 201


—

$2,227,000

.

As of December 31, 2013,

CASH EQUIVALENTS

We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our extending credit to trade customers for the purchase of our products. The terms generally provide for payment within 30 days of being invoiced. On occasion, when necessary to conform to regional industry practices, we sell product under extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or unsecured short-term notes; or, on occasion, notes with durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing accounts receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from short-term transactions (less than one year) other than the sale of our products, such as interest receivable; insurance claims; freight claims; tax refund claims; bid deposits or

rents receivable. Receivables are aged and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense are recorded.

Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 201


—

$602,000

,



—

$2,505,000

and


—

$1,644,000

. Write-offs of accounts receivables for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 201


—

$1,946,000

,



—

$2,805,000

and


—

$2,651,000

.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Financing receivables are included in accounts and notes receivable and/or investments and long-term receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financing receivables are contractual rights to receive money on demand or on fixed or determinable dates. Trade receivables with normal credit terms are not considered financing receivables. Financing receivables were as follows: December 31, 201


—

$7,720,000

and December 31, 201


—

$8,609,000

.

Both

of these

balances

include a related-party (Vulcan Materials Company Foundation) receivable in the amount of

$1,550,000

due in 2014.

None

of our financing receivables are individually significant. We evaluate the collectibility of financing receivables on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate we may be exposed to credit losses. As of December 31, 201


and 201


,

no

a

llowances were recorded for these receivables.

INVENTORIES

Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories because it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials, direct labor and production overhead. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. Substantially all operating supplies inventory is carried at average cost. For additional information regarding our inventories see Note 3.

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT

Property, plant & equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. The cost of properties held under capital leases, if any, is equal to the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease.

Capitalized software costs of

$10,321,000

and

$10,855,000

are reflected in net property, plant & equipment as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We capitalized software costs for the years ended December 31 as follows: 2013 —

$1,695,000

, 2012 —

$408,000

and 2011 —

$3,746,000

. During the same periods,

$2,230,000

,

$2,463,000

and

$2,520,000

, respectively, of previously capitalized costs were depreciated. For additional information regarding our property, plant & equipment see Note 4.

Part I

I


REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments that add materially to the utility or useful lives of property, plant & equipment are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance activities, related primarily to periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to the next overhaul.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION, ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated service lives of the various classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (


to


years), buildings (


to


years) and land improvements (


to


years). Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis beginning when the software project is substantially complete. Depreciation for our Newberry, Florida cement production facilities is computed by the unit-of-production method based on estimated output.

Cost depletion on depletable quarry land is computed by the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units.

Accretion reflects the period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset retirement obligations. It is computed using the same credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to initially measure the liability at fair value.

Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful

lives.

Amortization

of intangible assets subject to amortization is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets.

A significant portion of our intangible assets is contractual rights in place associated with zoning, permitting and other rights to access and extract aggregates reserves. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense

for the years ended December 31 is outlined below:

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We periodically use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, currency exchange risk or price fluctuations on commodity energy sources consistent with our risk management policies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments are presented in Note 5.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2:

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data

Level 3:

Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement

Part I

Our

assets

at December 31

subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below:

We have established

two

Rabbi Trust

s for the purpose of

provid

ing

a level of security for the

employee

nonqualified retirement and de

ferred compensation

plans

and

for the directors' nonqualified deferred compensation plans

. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds and equity securities for which quoted prices in active markets are available.

Level 2 investments are stated at estimated

fair value based on the underlying investments in those funds

(short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit).

Net trading

gains (losses) of

the Rabbi Trust investments were

$4,398,000,

$8,564,000

and

$(3,292,000)

for the years ended December 31, 201


,



and 2011

, respectively. The portion

at December 31, 201


,



and 2011

were

$4,234,000, $9,012,000

and

$(3,370,000),

respectively.

The carrying values of our cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, current maturities of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, trade payables and

accruals, and all other current liabilities

approximate their fair values because of the

short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

There were no assets or liabilities subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis in 201


. Assets that were subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis as of

December 3

GOODWILL AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of December 31, 201

3, goodwill totaled

$3,081,521,000

as compared to

$3,086,716,000

at December 31, 201


. Total goodwill represents

37%

of total assets at December 31, 201

3 compared to

38%

as of

December 31, 201


.

Goodwill is

tested

for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.

Goodwill is tested for imp

airment

one level below our operating segments (reporting unit). W

e have identified


reporting units, of which


carry goodwil

l. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test.

The first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, concrete, asphalt mix and

cement. Within these four operating segments, we have identified


reporting units based primarily on geographic location.

The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those reporting units as of the measurement date. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach, which involves discounting estimated future cash flows, and a market approach, which involves the app

lication of revenue and

EBITDA

multiples of comparable companies. We consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. To substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations, we reconcile the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization.

We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

The results of the first step of the annual impairment tests performed as of November 1,



and 2012

indicated that the

fair values of all reporting

units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying

values. The

results of the first step of the annual impairment tests performed as of November 1, 201


indicated that the fair values of the reporting units with

goodwill exceeded

their carrying values. Accordingly, there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


or 201


.

D

etermining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable

management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

For additional information regarding goodwill see Note 18.

Part I

I


IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 201


,

net

p

roperty, plant & equipmen

t r

epresents

40%

of total assets, while

net

other intangible asset

s r

epresents

8%

of total assets. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is determined primarily

by

using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g. ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates and cement) determines the profitability of the downstream business.

We recorded no asset impairments during 2013.

During 2012, we recorded a

$2,034,000

loss on impairment of long-lived assets

related primarily to a

ssets classified as held for sale (see Note 19

).

Long-lived asset impairments durin

g 2

011 were immaterial

and related to property abandonments

.

For

additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets see Notes 4 and 18.

COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE

We have Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI) policies for which the cash surrender values, loans outstanding and the net values included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 are as follows:

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized at the time the selling price is fixed, the product's title is transferred to the buyer and collectibility of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured (typically occurs when finished products are shipped to the customer). Total revenues include sales of products to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and third-party delivery revenues billed to customers. We bill our customers for transportation provided by third-party carriers for delivery of their purchased products.

Part I

I


DEFERRED REVENUE

We have entered into two transactions (September 2013 and December 2012) through which we sold a percentage of the future production from aggregates reserves at eight quarries (seven owned and one leased). These sales were structured as volumetric production payments (VPPs). W

e received net cash proceeds of

$153,095,000

and

$73,644,000

for the 2013 and 2012 transactions, respectively.

Concurrently, we entered into marketing agreements with the purchaser through which we are designated the exclusive sales agent for the purchaser’s percentage of future production. Our consolidated t

otal revenues

for 2013 and 2012 exclude the proceeds from these VPP transactions.

Th

e

proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized

t

o revenu

e

on a unit-of sales basis over the terms of the

VPP

transactions

.

The common key terms of both VPP transactions are:

§

the purchaser has a nonoperating interest in reserves entitling them to a percentage of future production

§

there is no minimum annual or cumulative production or sales volume, nor any minimum sales price required

§

the purchaser has the right to take its percentage of future production in physical product, or receive the cash proceeds from the sale of its percentage of future production under the terms of a separate marketing agreement

§

the purchaser's percentage of future production is conveyed free and clear of future costs of production and sales

§

we retain full operational and marketing control of the specified quarries

§

we retain fee simple interest in the land as well as any residual values that may be realized upon the conclusion of mining

The key terms specific to the 2013 VPP transaction are:

§

terminate at the earlier to occur of September 30, 2051 or the sale of

250.8

million tons of aggregates from the specified quarries subject to the VPP; based on historical and projected

sales

volumes from the specified quarries, it is expected that 250.8 million tons will be sold prior to September 30, 2051

§

the purchaser's percentage of the maximum 250.8 million tons of future production is estimated, based on current sales volumes projections, to be

11.5%

(approximately


million tons); the actual percentage may vary

The key terms specific to the 2012 VPP transaction are:

§

terminate at the earlier to occur of December 31, 2052 or the sale of

143.2

million tons of aggregates from the specified quarries subject to the VPP; based on historical and projected volumes from the specified quarries, it is expected that 143.2 million tons will be sold prior to December 31, 2052

§

the purchaser's percentage of the maximum 143.2 million tons of future production is estimated, based on current sales volumes projections, to be

10.5%

(approximately


million tons); the actual percentage may vary

The

impact to our net sales and gross margin related to the VPPs is outlined as follows:

Based on

expected

aggregates sales from the specified quarries, we anticipate recognizing a range of

$

4,500,000

to

$

5,500,000

of deferred revenue in our 2014 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income

.

STRIPPING COSTS

In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits are referred to as stripping costs.

Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered costs of extracted minerals under our inventory costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. The production stage is deemed to begin when the activities, including removal of overburden and waste material that may contain incidental saleable material, required to access the saleable product are

complete. Stripping

costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced were

$41,716,000

in 2013,

$37,875,000

in 2012 and

$40,049,000

in 2011

.

Part I

I


Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are excluded from our inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized and reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are expensed over the productive life of the mine using the unit-of-production method. Pre-production stripping costs included in other noncurrent assets were

$

24,026,000

as of December 31, 2013 and

$18,887,000

as of December 31, 201


.

OTHER COSTS

Costs are charged to earnings as incurred for the start-up of new plants and for normal recurring costs of mineral exploration and research and development. Research and development costs totaled

$0

in 2013,

$0

in 2012 and

$1,109,000

in 2011, and are included in selling, administrative and general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We account for our share-based compensation awards using fair-value-based measurement methods. These result in the recognition of compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards, including stock options, based on their fair value as of the grant

date. Compensation

cost is recognized over the requisite service period.

We receive an income tax deduction for share-based compensation equal to the excess of the market value of our common stock on the date of exercise or issuance over the exercise price. Tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows. The

$161,000

,

$267,000

and

$121,000

in excess tax benefits classified as financing cash inflows for the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


and 20


, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relate to the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under long-term incentive plans.

A summary of the estimated future compensation cost (unrecognized compensation expense) as of December 31, 201


related to share-based awards granted to employees under our long-term incentive plans is presented below:


Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights (SOSARs)

Pretax compensation expense related to our employee share-based compensation awards and related income tax benefits for the years ended December 31 are summarized below:

RECLAMATION COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation

tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

The carrying value of these obligations was

$228,234,000

as of December 31, 2013 and

$150,072,000

as of December 31, 201


. For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations) see Note 17.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The primary assumptions are as follows:

§

Discount Rate

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit pa

yments to be made in the futur

e

§

Expected Return on Plan Assets

— We project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce

the recorded net benefit cost

s

§

Rate of Compensation Increase

— For salary-related plans only, we project employees' annual pay increases

through 2015

, which are used to project employees'

pension benefits at retiremen

t

§

Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Healthcare Benefits

— We project the expected increases in the cost

of covered healthcare benefit

s

Accounting standards provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The differences between actual results and expected or estimated results are recognized in full in

other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in a systematic

manner over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see Note 10.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. We expense or capitalize environmental

costs

consistent

with our capitalization

policy. We expense

costs

for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues. We accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur.

When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 201


, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was

$3,944,000

. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates, including key assumptions, for accruing environmental compliance costs; however, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see Note 8.

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to

$2,000,000

per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to

$3,000,000

per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. The following table outlines our

self-insurance program

at December

31:

Estimated payments (undiscounted) under our self-insurance program for the five years subsequent to December 31, 201


are as follows:

Part I

I


Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

INCOME TAXES

We file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns, including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries. We account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability meth

od. Sig

nificant judgments and estimates are required in determining

our

current and deferred

tax

assets and liabilities

, which reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay

.

These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying

amounts

of assets and liabilities

and the

amounts used for income tax purposes

. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns

. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in

Note 9.

On an annual basis, we perform a

comprehensive analysis

of all forms of positive and negative evidence based on year end results. During each interim period, we update our annual analysis for significant changes in the positive and negative

evidence.

If

we

later

determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance will be reduced. Conversely, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase the valuation allowance.

U.S. i

ncome taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore.

At least annually, w

e evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested

offshore.

We recognize

a tax

benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained

based upon the technical merits of the position

. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than

50%

likelihood of being reali

zed. Ou

r liability associated with unrecognized

t

ax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. Our income tax provision includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x

benefits.

The years open to

tax

examinations

vary

by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is

adequate.

We

consider an

issue to

be resolved

at

the earlier of

the issue being “effectively settled,”

settlement of an examination,

or

the expiration of the statute of limitat

ions.

Upon resolution, unrecognized tax benefits will be reversed as a discrete event.

Our

liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x

b

enefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits as income tax expense.

Our largest permanent item in computing both our

taxable income and

effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

We report comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Eq

uity. Com

prehensive income comprises two subsets: net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI includes fair value adjustments to cash flow hedges, actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs related to pension and postretirement benefit plans.

For additional information regarding comprehensive income see Note 14.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)

We report two earnings per share numbers, basic and diluted. These are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution (diluted EPS), as set forth below:

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our earnings per share calculations. Antidilutive common stock equivalents are not included in our earnings per share calculations. In periods of loss, shares that otherwise would have been included in our diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding computation are excluded. These excluded shares for the years ended December 31 are as follows: 2012 —

617,000

and 2011 —

304,000

.

The number of antidilutive common stock equivalents for which the exercise price exceeds the weighted-average market price for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform with the 2013 presentation.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED

2013 — NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT ON OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

As of and for the interim period ended March 31, 2013, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-11, “Disclosures About Offsetting Assets an

d Liabilities.” This ASU create

d

new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial and derivative instruments. The scope of instruments covered under this ASU was further clarified in the January 2013 issuance of ASU 2013-01, “Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.” These new disclosures

were

designed to facilitate comparisons between financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP and those prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

2013 — AMENDMENTS ON INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING

As of and for the interim period ended March 31, 2013, we adopted ASU No. 2012-02, “Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.” This ASU

amend

ed

the impairment testing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-30, “General Intangibles Other Than Goodwill.” Under the amended guidance, an entity has the option of performing a qualitative assessment when testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. Further testing would be required only if, on the basis of the qualitative factors, an entity determines that the fair value of the intangible asset is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) less than the carrying amount

. Additionally, this ASU revise

d

the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider when determining if an interim impairment test is required. Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

2013/2012 — PRESENTATION OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

As of the annual period ended December 31, 2011, we adopted ASU No. 2011-05, "Presentation of Comprehensive I

ncome." This standard eliminate

d

the option to present components of other comprehensive income (OCI) as part of the statement of equity. The amendments in this standard require

d

that all nonowner changes in equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2011-12, “Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05.” ASU

No. 2011-12 indefinitely defer

red

the requirement in ASU No. 2011-05 to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensiv

e Income.” ASU 2013-02 finalize

d

the requirements of ASU 2011-05 that ASU 2011-12 deferred, clarifying how to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. Our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income conform to the presentation requirements of these

standards.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION

GUIDANCE ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT  In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, "Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists" which provides explicit presentation guidelines. Under this ASU, an unrecognized tax benefit, or portion thereof, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward except when specific conditions are met as outlined in the ASU. When these specific conditions are met, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date. Both early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2014. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Part I

I


GUIDANCE ON THE LIQUIDATION BASIS OF ACCOUNTING  In April 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07, “Liquidation Basis of Accounting” which provides guidance on when and how to apply the liquidation basis of accounting and on what to disclose. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied prospectively from the date liquidation is imminent. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

GUIDANCE FOR OBLIGATIONS RESULTING FROM JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ARRANGEMENTS  In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, "Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date" which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of such obligations that are within the scope of the ASU. Obligations within the scope of this ASU include debt arrangements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation and judicial rulings. Under this ASU, an entity (1) recognizes such obligations at the inception of the arrangement, (2) measures such obligations as the sum of (a) the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and (b) any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors and (3) discloses the nature and amount of such obligations as well as other information about those obligations. This ASU is effective for all prior periods in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2013, with retrospective application required. We will adopt this standard as of and fo

r the interim period ending

March 31

, 2014. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

TANGIBLE PROPERTY REGULATIONS  In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service issued final tangible property regulations. These regulations apply to amounts paid to acquire, produce or improve tangible property, as well as dispose of such property and are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. We have considered the effect of these

tax law changes to our deferred tax assets and liabilities and do not expect their implementation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation. In addition to the initial cash proceeds, Basic Chemicals was required to make payments under

two

earn-out agreements subject to certain conditions. During 2007, we received the final payment under the ECU (electrochemical unit) earn-out

,

bringing cumulative cash receipts to its

$150,000,000

cap.

Proceeds under the second earn-out agreement are based on the performance of the hydrochlorocarbon product HCC-240fa (commonly referred to as 5CP) from the closing of the transaction through December 31, 2012 (5CP earn-out). The primary determinant of the value for this earn-out is the level of growth in 5CP sales volume

The financial results of the Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. There were no net sales or revenues from discontinued operations for the years presented. Results from discontinued operations are as follows:

The 20


and 2012 pretax losses from discontinued operations of $

5,744,000

and $

8,017,000

were due primarily to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business. The

2011 pretax loss from discontinued operations of $3,66


,000 includes a $7,575,000 pretax gain recognized on recovery from an insurer in lawsuits involving perchloroethylene (perc). This gain was offset by general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and e

nvironmental remediation costs.

$

27,331,000

and

$

35,477,000

at December 31, 2013 and

$

267,591,000

at December 31, 201

.The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 20


results was to

de

crease cost of goods sold by $

1,124,000

and

in

crease net earnings by $

688,000

.The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2011 results was to decrease cost of goods sold by $1,288,000 and increase net earnings by $776,000.

Estimated current cost exceeded LIFO cost at December 31, 201


and 201


by

$

184,409,000

and

$

150,654,000

, respectively. We use the LIFO method of valuation for most of our inventories as it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. We provide supplemental income disclosures to facilitate comparisons with companies not on LIFO. The supplemental income calculation is derived by tax-effecting the change in the LIFO reserve for the periods presented. If all inventories valued at LIFO cost had been valued under the methods (substantially average cost) used prior to the adoption of the LIFO method, the approximate effect on net earnings would have been

a

NOTE 5: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to hedge against these market risks. We do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.

The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationship. The interest rate swap agreements described below were designated as either

cash flow

hedges or

fair value

hedges. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap

cash flow

hedges are recorded

in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into

interest expense

in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.

The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap

fair value

hedges are recorded

as interest expense consistent with the change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged

.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

We

have

use

d

interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in interest rates.

D

uring 2007, we entered into fifteen forward starting interest rate swap agreements for a total stated amount of $1,500,000,000. Upon the 2007 and 2008 issuances of the related fixed-rate debt, we terminated and settled these forward starting swaps for cash payments of

$89,777,000

. Amounts in

AOCI

are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Th

is amortization was reflected in the

accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 201


, we estimate that $

4,827,000

of the pretax loss

in

AOCI

will be reclassified to earnings.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

We

have

use

d

interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that results from fluctuations in the benchmark interest rates for such debt. In June


, we issued $500,000,000 of

6.50%

fixed-rate notes due in 2016. Concurrently, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of $500,000,000. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.05% and received a fixed interest rate of 6.50%. Additionally, in June 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our $150,000,000 of

10.125%

fixed-rate notes due in 2015. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of 8.03% and received a fixed interest rate of 10.125%. In August 2011, we terminated and settled these interest rate swap agreements for

$25,382,000

of cash proceeds. The $23,387,000 forward component

of the settlement (cash proceeds less $1,995,000 of accrued interest) was added to the carrying value of the related debt and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining lives of the related debt using the ef

fective interest method. This amortization was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as follows:

In December

2011, we

entered into a

bank line of credit

expiring on

December 15, 2016

$500,000,000

and extend its term to

March 12, 2018

. The line of credit is secured by certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory.

Borrowing capacity fluctuates with the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and may be less than $500,000,000 at any point in time.

As of December 31, 2013, our available borrowing capacity was

$382,588,000

(net of the

Borrowings under

the line

of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to the lower of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from

NOTE 10: BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor

three

funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees hired prior to July 15, 2007, other than those covered by union-administered plans. Normal retirement age is 65, but the plans contain provisions for earlier retirement. Benefits for the Salaried

Plan are

generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the Construction Materials Hourly Plan and the Chemicals Hourly Plan provide benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of service. Effective July 15, 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans and our then existing defined contribution 401(k) plans to no longer accept new participants.

In

December

2013, we amended our defined benefit plans so that future

service

accruals for salaried pension participants

would

cease effective December 31, 2013. This amendment included

a

special transition provision which will allow

covered compensation

through December 31, 2015 to be considered in the participants’ benefit calculations. The amendment resulted in a curtailment and remeasurement of the salaried and nonqualified pension plans as of May 31, 2013 that reduced our 2013 pension expense by approximately $7,600,000 (net of the one-time curtailment loss noted below) of which

$800,000

relates to discontinued operations.

In addition to these qualified plans, we sponsor

three

unfunded, nonqualified pension plans. The projected benefit obligation presented in the table below includes

$93,600,000

and

$92,322,000

, respectively, related to these plans for 201


and 201


.

The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the plans and their reconciliation with the related amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements at December 31:


The 2013 amendment eliminated future accrual

s

for salaried pension participants effective December 31, 2013.


The 2012 amendment to the salaried plan was necessary to maintain compliance with

IRS non

discrimination

requirements

.

The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) exceeded plan assets for all of our defined benefit plans except the Chemicals Hourly Plan at December 31, 2013 and for all defined benefit plans at December

Part I

I


31, 2012. Assets in the Chemicals Hourly Plan of $91,803,000 exceeded its ABO by $3,919,000 and its PBO by $3,056,000 at December 31, 2013. The ABO for all of our defined benefit pension plans totaled $891,394,000 (unfunded, nonqualified plans of

$89,289,000)

at December 31, 2013 and $928,059,000 (unfunded, nonqualified plans of

$88,643,000)

at December 31, 2012.

The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost, amounts recognized in other comprehensive income and weighted-average assumptions of the plans at December 31:

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension benefit cost during 201


are $

9,983,000

and $

187,000

respectively.

Assumptions regarding our expected return on plan assets are based primarily on judgments made by us and

the Finance

Committee

of our Board

. These judgments take into account the expectations of our pension plan consultants and actuaries and our investment advisors, and the opinions of market professionals. We base our expected return on long-term investment expectations. The expected return on plan assets used to determine 201


pension benefit cost was

7.50

%

.

Part I

I


We establish our pension investment policy by evaluating asset/liability studies periodically performed by our consultants. These studies estimate trade-offs between expected returns on our investments and the variability in anticipated cash contributions to fund our pension liabilities. Our policy balances the variability in potential pension fund contributions to expected returns on our investments.

Our current strategy for implementing this policy is to invest in publicly traded equities and in publicly traded debt and private, nonliquid opportunities, such as venture capital, commodities, buyout funds and mezzanine debt. The target allocation ranges for plan assets are as follows: equity securities —


% to


%; debt securities —


% to


%; specialty investments —


% to


%; and cash reserves —


% to


%. Equity securities include domestic investments and foreign equities in the Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Emerging Market Indices. Debt securities

primarily

include domestic debt instruments, while specialty investments include investments in venture capital, buyout funds, mezzanine debt

,

private partnerships and an interest in a commodity index fund.

The fair values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 201


and 201


by asset category are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 201

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 201



See Note 1 under the caption

M

easurements for a description of the fair value hierarchy.

At each measurement date, we estimate the fair value of our pension assets using various valuation techniques. We utilize, to the extent available, quoted market prices in active markets or observable market inputs in estimating the fair value of our pension assets. When quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not available, we utilize valuation techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of our pension assets. The following describes the types of investments included in each asset category listed in the table

s

above and the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair values as of December 31,

2013 and



.

The debt securities category consists of bonds issued by U.S. federal, state and local governments, corporate debt securities, fixed income obligations issued by foreign governments, and asset-backed securities. The fair values of U.S. government and corporate debt securities are based on current market rates and credit spreads for debt securities with similar maturities. The fair values of debt securities issued by foreign governments are based on prices obtained from broker/dealers and international indices. The fair values of asset-backed securities are priced using prepayment speed and spread inputs that are sourced from the new issue market.

Part I

I


Investment funds consist of exchange traded and non-exchange traded

funds. The

commodity funds asset category consists of a single open-end commodity mutual fund. The equity funds asset category consists of index funds for domestic equities and an actively managed fund for international equities. The short-term funds asset category consists of a collective investment trust invested in highly liquid, short-term debt securities. For investment funds publicly traded on a national securities exchange, the fair value is based on quoted market prices. For investment funds not traded on an exchange, the total fair value of the underlying securities is used to determine the net asset value for each unit of the fund held by the pension fund. The estimated fair values of the underlying securities are generally valued based on quoted market prices. For securities without quoted market prices, other observable market inputs are utilized to determine the fair value.

The venture capital and partnerships asset category consists of various limited partnership funds, mezzanine debt funds and leveraged buyout funds. The fair value of these investments has been estimated based on methods employed by the general partners, including consideration of, among other things, reference to third-party transactions, valuations of comparable companies operating within the same or similar industry, the current economic and competitive environment, creditworthiness of the corporate issuer, as well as market prices for instruments with similar maturity, term, conditions and quality ratings. The use of different assumptions, applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value of these securities.

our pension

plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31 is presented below:

We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements for union-represented employees. A multiemployer plan is subject to collective bargaining for employees of two or more unrelated companies. Multiemployer plans are managed by boards of trustees on which management and labor have equal representation. However, in most cases, management is not directly represented. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans differ from single employer plans as follows:

§

assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers

§

if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers

§

if we cease to have an obligation to contribute to one or more of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we amended our postretirement healthcare plan to cap our portion of the medical coverage cost at the 2015 level.

Effective July 15, 2007, we amended our salaried postretirement healthcare coverage to increase the eligibility age for early retirement coverage to age 62, unless certain grandfathering provisions were met. Substantially all our salaried employees and where applicable, hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying age and meet certain service requirements. Generally, Company-provided healthcare benefits terminate when covered individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach age 65, whichever occurs first.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ASSUMPTIONS

Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. We also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high-quality bonds. At December 31, 201


, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from

3.80%

to

5.15%

(December 31, 2012 ranged from

3.05%

to

4.35%)

.

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 201


, the expected return on plan assets

remained at 7.50%

.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience and future expectations. At December 31, 201


, our projected weighted-average rate of compensation

increase remains at 3.50%

.

In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 201


, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits

remained at

7.50%

for 201


, decreasing each year until reaching

5.0


% in 20


and

r

emaining level thereafter.

Assumed

healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the following effects:

STOCK OPTIONS/SOSARS

— Stock options/SOSARs granted have an exercise price equal to the market value of our underlying common stock on the date of grant. With the exceptions of the stock option grants awarded in December 2005 and January 2006, the options/SOSARs vest ratably over


to


years and expire


years subsequent to the grant. The options awarded in December 2005 and January 2006 were fully vested on the date of grant and expire 10 years subsequent to the grant date. Vesting is accelerated upon reaching retirement age, death, disability, or change of control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested awards are forfeited upon termination for any other

reason.

The fair value of stock options/SOSARs is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation cost for stock options/SOSARs is based on this grant date fair value and is recognized for awards that ultimately vest. The following table presents the weighted-average fair value and the weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of

grants during the

years ended

December 31:


No SOSARs were granted in 2012.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity period approximating

the SOSARs

expected term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts

adjusted for current expectations of future payouts

. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility and expectations about future volatility of our common stock over a period equal to

the SOSARs

expected

term. The

expected term is based on historical experience and expectations about future exercises and represents the period of time

that SOSARs

granted are expected to be outstanding.

A summary of our stock option/SOSAR activity as of December 31, 201


and changes during the year are presented below:

The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between our stock price on the last trading day of



and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options/SOSARs) that would have been received by the option holders had all options/SOSARs been exercised on December 31, 201


. These values change based on the fair market value of our common stock. The aggregate intrinsic values of options

/SOSARs

exercised for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

Certain of our aggregates reserves are burdened by volumetric production payments (nonoperating interest) as described in Note 1

under the caption Deferred Revenue

. As the holder of the working interest, we have responsibility to bear the cost of mining and producing the reserves attributable to this nonoperating interest.

We provide

, in the normal course of business, certain third party beneficiaries

standby letters of credit

to support

our obligations to pay or perform

according to the requirements of an u

nderlying agreement.

Such

letters of credit

typically have an initial term of one year, typically renew automatically, and can only be modified or cancelled with the approval of the beneficiary. All of our letters of credit are issued by banks that participate in our

$500,000,000

line of credit, and reduce the borrowing capacity thereunder. We pay a fee for all letters of credit equal to the LIBOR margin (ranges from

1.50%

to

2.00%)

applicable to borrowings under the line of credit, plus

0.125%

.

Our standby letters of credit as of December 31, 201

by purpose

in the table below:

As described in Note 9, our liability for unrecogniz

In September 2001, we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) alleging damage to a 0.9-mile section of Joliet Road that bisects our McCook quarry in McCook, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. In 2010, we settled this lawsuit for $40,000,000 and recognized the full charge pending arbitration with our insurers. In 2011, we were awarded a total of $49,657,000 in payment of the insurers’ share of the settlement amount, attorneys' fees and

interest.

We

are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.

We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as potential obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While ultimate resolution and financial liability is uncertain at a number of the sites, in our opinion based on information currently available, the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to these sites will not have a

material effect

on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for that period. Amounts accrued for environmental matters are presented in

Note 8.

We are

a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine with precision the outcome, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.

In addition to these lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, certain other

material

legal proceedings are specifically described below. At this time, we cannot determine the likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss pertaining to these matters.

PERCHLOROETHYLENE CASES

We are a defendant in

a

case

involving perchloroethylene (perc), which was a product manufactured by our former Chemicals business. Perc is a cleaning solvent used in dry cleaning and other industrial application

s.

We are

vigorously defending

this

case:

§

Suffolk County Water Authority —

On July 29, 2010, we were served in an action styled

Suffolk County Water Authority v. The Dow Chemical Company, et al.

, in the Supreme Court for Suffolk County, State of New York. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff “owns and/or operates drinking water systems and supplies drinking water to thousands of residents and businesses, in Suffolk County, New York.” The complaint alleges that perc and its breakdown products “have been and are contaminating and damaging Plaintiff's drinking water supply wells.” The plaintiff is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

The trial cour

t r

uled that any detectable amount of perc in a well constitutes a legal injury. We are appealing this and other rulings of the trial court. Discovery is ongoing.

At this time, plaintiffs have not established that our perc was used at any specific dry cleaner,

or

that we are liable for any alleged

contamination.

§

R.R. Street Indemnity —

Street, a former distributor of perc manufactured by us, alleges that we owe

Street,

and its insurer (National Union), a defense and indemnity in severa

l l

itigation matters

in which Street was named as a defendant

. National Union alleges that we are obligated to contribute to National Union's share of defense fees, costs and any indemnity payments made on

Street's

behalf. We have had discussions with

Street

about the nature and extent of indemnity obligations, if any, and to date there has been no resolution of these

issues.

LOWER PASSAIC RIVER

MATTER

§

NJDEP LITIGATION

—

In 2009, Vulcan and over 300 other parties were named as third-party defendants in

New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, et al. v. Occidental Chemical Corporation, et al.

, a case

originally

brought by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in the New Jersey Superior Court. Vulcan was

brought into

the

suit due

to alleged discharges to the

l

ower Passaic River (River) from the former Chemicals Division - Newark Plant.

Vulcan owned and operated this site as a chloralkali plant from 1961-1974. In 1974, we sold the plant, although we continued to operate the plant for one additional year.

This suit by the NJDEP seeks recovery of past and future clean-up costs, as well as unspecified economic damages, punitive damages, penalties and a variety of other forms of relief.

All defendants, with the exception of Occidental Chemical Corporation, have reached

a s

ettlement agreement with the plaintiffs

, which has been approved by the court. Since this matter has been settled, we will not report on it further

.

§

Lower Passaic River Study Area (Superfund Site)

—

Vulcan and approximately 70 other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of the lower 17 miles of the River. Separately, the EPA issued a draft Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) that evaluated early action remedial alternatives for a portion of the River. The EPA

was given a

range of estimated cost

s

for these alternative

s b

etween

$0.9

billion and

$3.5

billion, although estimates of the cost and timing of future environmental remediation requirements are inherently imprecise

and subject to revision

.

T

he EPA has not released the final FFS.

As an interim step related to the 2007 AOC, Vulcan

and 69 other

c

ompanie

s v

oluntarily entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent on June 18, 2012 with the EPA for

remediation actions focused

at River Mile 10.9

of

th

e R

iver.

Our e

stimated costs related to this focused remediation action

, based on an interim allocation,

are immaterial and have been accrued. On June 25, 2012, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order for Removal Response Activities to Occidental Chemical Corporation ordering Occidental to participate and cooperate in this remediation action at River Mile 10.9.

At

this time, we cannot reasonably estimate our liability related to this matter because the RI/FS is ongoing; the ultimate remedial approach and associated cost has not been determined; and the parties that will participate in funding the remediation and their respective allocations are not yet known.

OTHER LITIGATION

§

TEXAS BRINE MATTER

—

During the operation of its former Chemicals Division, Vulcan was the lessee to a salt lease from 1976 – 2005 in an underground salt dome formation in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. The Texas Brine Company operated this salt mine for the account of Vulcan. Vulcan sold its Chemicals Division in 2005 and assigned the lease to the purchaser, and Vulcan has had no association with the leased premises or Texas Brine Company since that time. In August 2012, a sinkhole developed near the salt dome and numerous lawsuits were filed in state court in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Other lawsuits, including class action litigation, were also filed in August 2012 in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans. There are numerous defendants to the litigation in state and federal court. Vulcan was first brought into the litigation as a third-party defendant in August 2013 by the Texas Brine Company. Vulcan has since been added as a direct and third-party defendant by other parties, including a direct claim by the State of Louisiana. The damages alleged in the litigation range from individual plaintiffs’ claims for property damage, to the State of Louisiana’s claim for response costs, to claims for indemnity and contribution from Texas Brine. It is alleged that Vulcan was negligent as a lessee under the salt lease, that Vulcan breached the salt lease, and that Vulcan breached an operating agreement with Texas Brine.

Vulcan denies any liability in this matter and will vigorously defend the litigation. We cannot reasonably estimate any liability related to this matter.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and a number of factors, including developments in ongoing discovery or adverse rulings,

or the verdict of a particular jury,

could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued costs. No liability was recorded for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be only reasonably possible or for which a loss could not be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in defense of lawsuits are expensed as incurred. In addition, losses on certain claims and litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a per occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described in Note 1 under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.

NOTE 15: SEGMENT REPORTING

We have

four

operating

(and reporting)

segments organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, concrete, asphalt mix and cement.

The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel, sand, and other aggregates) and related products and services (transportation and

other). During



, the Aggregates segment principally served markets in

eighteen

states, the

District of Columbia, the Bahamas and Mexico with a full line of aggregates, and

eleven

additional states with railroad ballast. Customers use aggregates primarily in the construction and maintenance of highways, streets and other public works and in the construction of housing and commercial, industrial and other nonresidential facilities. Customers are served by truck, rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities and sales yards. Due to the high weight-to-value ratio of aggregates, markets generally are local in nature. Quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be available. We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the United States. Nondomestic net sales were

$12,339,000

in 2013,

$14,733,000

in 2012 and

$16,678,000

in 2011

.

The Concrete segment produces and sells ready-mixed

concrete in

six

states

and

the District of Columbia.

Additionally, we

produce and sell

, in a limited number of these markets,

other concrete products such as block and precast and resell purchased building materials related to the use of ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.

The Asphalt Mix segment produces and sells asphalt mix

in three states

primarily in our southwestern and western markets.

Aggregates comprise approximately

78%

of ready-mixed concrete by weight and

95%

of asphalt mix by weight. Our Concrete and Asphalt Mix segments are almost wholly supplied with their aggregates requirements from our Aggregates segment. These intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of product utilized in the production of ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix. Customers for our Concrete and Asphalt Mix segments are generally served locally at our production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly, delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately


to


miles from the producing facility.

The Cement segment produces and sells Portland and masonry cement in both bulk and bags from our Florida cement plant. Other Cement segment facilities in Florida import and export cement, clinker and slag and either resell, grind, blend, bag or reprocess those materials. This segment also includes a Florida facility that mines, produces and sells calcium

products. Our

Concrete segment is the largest single customer of our Cement segment.

The vast majority of our activities are domestic. Long-lived assets outside the United States, which consist primarily of property, plant & equipment, were

$140,504,000

in 2013,

$138,415,000

in 2012 and

$142,988,000

in 2011

Equity method investments of

$22,962,000

in 2013,

$22,965,000

in 2012 and

NOTE

16: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW

INFORMATION

Supplemental information referable to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is summarized below:

NOTE 17: ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets.

Recognition of a liability for an ARO is required in the period in which it is incurred at its estimated fair value. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. If the ARO

is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement.

We record all AROs for which we have legal obligations for land reclamation at estimated fair value. Essentially all these AROs relate to our underlying land parcels, including both owned properties and mineral leases. For the years ended December 31, we recognized ARO operating costs related to accretion of the liabilities and depreciation of the assets as follows:

ARO operating costs are reported in cost of goods sold. AROs are reported within other noncurrent liabilities in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Reconciliations of the carrying amounts of our

AROs

for the years ended December 31 are

as follows:

Part I

I


The ARO liabilities incurred during 2013 relate primarily to reclamation activities required under a new development agreement and a conditional use permit at an aggregates facility on owned property in Southern California. The reclamation requirements at this property will result in the restoration and development of mined property into a 90 acre tract suitable for commercial and retail development.

U

pward revisions to our ARO liability during 2013 are largely attributable to an adjacent aggregates facility on owned propert

y.

The estimated cost to fill and compact the property increased and the estimated settlement date decreased resulting

in

an upward revision to the ARO.

Downward r

evisions to our

ARO liability

during 2012 relate primarily to extensions in the estimated settlement dates a

t numerous sites

.

NOTE 18: GOODWILL

AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We classify purchased intangible assets into three categories: (1) goodwill, (2) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization and (3) intangible assets with indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually. For additional information regarding our policies on impairment reviews, see Note 1 under the captions Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment, and Impairment of Long-lived Assets excluding Goodwill.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is recognized when the consideration paid for a business combination (acquisition) exceeds the fair value of the tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. There were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31,



,



and



.

We have four reportable segments organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, concrete, asphalt mix and cement. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31,



,



and



are summarized below:


The goodwill of divested businesses relates to the 2013 divestitures discussed in Note 19.

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying

value. A

decrease

in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of

goodwill.

Part I

I


INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are stated at their fair value determined as of the date of acquisition. Costs incurred to renew or extend the life of existing intangible assets are capitalized. These capitalized renewal/extension costs were immaterial for the years presented. Intangible assets consist of contractual rights in place (primarily permitting and zoning rights), noncompetition agreements, favorable lease agreements, customer relationships and trade names and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired individually or otherwise obtained outside a business combination consist primarily of permitting, permitting compliance and zoning rights and are stated at their historical cost, less accumulated amortization, if applicable.

See

Note 19 for the details of the intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions during 2013

and 2012

.

Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

Intangible

assets are

reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no charges for impairment of intangible assets in the years ended December 31,



,

.

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major intangible asset class for the years ended December 31 are summarized below:

Estimated amortization expense for the five years subsequent to December 31, 201


is as follows:

,

DIVESTITURES

AND PENDING DIVESTITURES

In 2013, we acquired:

$117,000,000

. We previously operated this quarry under a lease which was scheduled to expire in 2017

§

one

aggregates production facility and

four

ready-mixed concrete facilities for

$29,983,000

. As a result, we recognized

$5,425,000

of amortizable intangible assets (contractual rights in place). The contractual rights in place will be amortized against earnings using the unit-of-production method over an estimated weighted-average period in excess of


years and will be deductible for income tax purposes over


years

§

two

aggregates production facilities for

$59,968,000

. After finalizing the purchase price allocation, we recognized

$3,620,000

of amortizable intangible assets (contractual rights in place). The contractual rights in place will be amortized against earnings using the unit-of-production method over an estimated weighted-average period in excess of


years and will be deductible for income tax purposes over

a percentage of the future production from aggregates reserves at certain owned quarries. The sale was structured as a volumetric production payment (VPP) for which we received gross cash proceeds of

$154,000,000

and incurred transaction costs of

$905,000

.

The net proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized on a unit-of-sales basis to revenues over the term of the VPP

Effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility. We strive to achieve value through our mining activities as well as incremental value through effective post-mining land management. Our land management strategy includes routinely reclaiming and selling our previously mined land. Additionally, this strategy includes developing conservation banks by preserving land as a suitable habitat for endangered or sensitive species. These conservation banks have received approval from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to offer mitigation credits for sale to third parties who may be required to compensate for the loss of habitats of endangered or sensitive species.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES

We maintain a system of controls

and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a - 15(e) or 15d -15(e)), include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other management officials, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 201


. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

We are in the process of replacing our legacy information technology systems and hav

e co

mpleted the implementation of

our

financial reporting software, which is a major component of the replacement.

In addition, we have substantially completed

implement

ation of our

quote to cash software system, which is another significant component of the replacement. The new information technology systems

are the source of most

of the information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are continuing to work toward the full implementation of the

quote to cash system and expect the implementation to be completed during the third quarter of 2014.

No other changes were made to our internal controls over financial reporting or other factors that could materially affect these controls during the fourth quarter of 201

MANAGEMENT

'S REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management's supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

(1992)

issued by

the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 201


.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


. Deloitte & Touche LLP's report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, follows this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM – INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 201


based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated

Framework

(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the

effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective

internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding

of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


based on the criteria

established in

Internal Control

Integrated Framework

(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial

statements of

the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 201


and our report dated

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
