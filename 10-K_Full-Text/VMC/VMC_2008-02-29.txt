Item 1. Business

Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references in this report to
“Vulcan,” the “company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Vulcan Materials Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries. We entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the “merger
agreement,” dated as of February 19, 2007, as amended on April 9, 2007, with Legacy Vulcan Corp., a
New Jersey corporation formerly named Vulcan Materials Company (“Legacy Vulcan”), Florida Rock
Industries, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Florida Rock”), Virginia Merger Sub, Inc. and Fresno
Merger Sub, Inc. Pursuant to the merger agreement, on November 16, 2007, our newly created wholly
owned subsidiary, Virginia Merger Sub, Inc., merged with and


into Legacy Vulcan (the “Vulcan merger”), and our newly created wholly owned subsidiary, Fresno
Merger Sub, Inc., merged with and into Florida Rock (the “Florida Rock merger”) each of Legacy
Vulcan and Florida Rock became our wholly owned subsidiaries. We refer to these mergers in this
report as the “mergers.” Pursuant to the mergers, the existing shareholders of Legacy Vulcan and
Florida Rock became our shareholders. As a result of the mergers, each Legacy Vulcan shareholder
received one share of our common stock for each share of outstanding common stock of Legacy Vulcan
held and 30% of the outstanding shares of Florida Rock common stock were each converted into the
right to receive 0.63 shares of our common stock. In addition, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our name was changed from Virginia Holdco, Inc.
to Vulcan Materials Company, and Legacy Vulcan’s name was changed from Vulcan Materials Company to
Legacy Vulcan Corp. References in this report to “Legacy Vulcan” are to Legacy Vulcan Corp. and its
consolidated subsidiaries. References to “Florida Rock” are to Florida Rock Industries, Inc. and
its consolidated subsidiaries.

We provide infrastructure materials that are required by the American economy. Headquartered in
Birmingham, Alabama, we are the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates, primarily
crushed stone, sand and gravel, a major producer of asphalt and concrete and a leading producer of
cement in Florida. We are a New Jersey corporation that was incorporated on February 14, 2007, and
has held Legacy Vulcan, formerly named Vulcan Materials Company, and Florida Rock as direct wholly
owned subsidiaries since the completion of the mergers described above. Florida Rock was a leading
producer of construction aggregates, cement, concrete and concrete products in the southeastern and
mid-Atlantic states. The mergers further diversify the geographic scope of our operations,
expanding our presence in attractive Florida markets and in other high-growth southeastern and
mid-Atlantic states, and adding approximately 1.7 billion tons of proven and probable minerals
reserves in markets where reserves are increasingly scarce. Unless otherwise indicated, all
information included in this report includes Vulcan and Florida Rock on a consolidated basis.

Prior to the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock, our Construction Materials business
was organized in seven regional divisions that produced and sold aggregates and related products
and services. All these divisions exhibited similar economic characteristics, production processes,
products and services, types and classes of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory
environments. Accordingly, they were aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting
purposes.

Subsequent to our acquisition of Florida Rock, we redefined our operating segments. As a
result, we now have three reporting segments organized around our principal product lines:
Aggregates, Asphalt mix and Concrete, and Cement. We have combined our Asphalt mix and Concrete
operations into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses
exhibit similar economic characteristics, product processes, types and classes of customer, methods
of distribution and regulatory environments. We have recast our 2006 and 2005 data to conform to
the current year’s segment presentation.

Aggregates Segment Overview

Construction aggregates include crushed stone, sand and gravel, rock asphalt and recycled
concrete. Aggregates are essential infrastructure materials required by the U. S. economy, and are
employed in virtually all types of construction, including highway construction and maintenance,
and in the production of asphalt mix and Portland cement concrete. Aggregates also are widely used
as railroad track ballast. The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates and related
products and services in eight regional divisions. Our Aggregates segment constituted approximately
75%, 75% and 76% of our net dollar sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Less than 1% of our
Aggregates segment net sales in 2007 was attributable to Florida Rock since only Florida Rock
results after November 16, 2007 were included.

During 2007, the Aggregates segment served markets in 22 states, the District of Columbia, the
Bahamas and Mexico with a full line of aggregates, and 8 additional states with railroad ballast.
Customers are served by truck, rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities
and sales yards. Due to the high weight-to-value ratio of aggregates, markets generally are local
in nature. Quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where
local aggregates reserves may not be available. We sell a relatively small amount of construction
aggregates outside the United States. Nondomestic net sales were $19,981,000 in 2007, $20,595,000
in 2006 and $13,490,000 in 2005.

Each type of aggregate is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates, as
well as the same type of aggregate. Because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in
the business, competition generally is limited to



areas in proximity to production facilities. Noteworthy exceptions are areas where there are no
economically viable deposits of aggregates. These areas include sections of the Mississippi,
Tennessee-Tombigbee and James River systems, and the Gulf Coast and South Atlantic Coast, which are
served from remote quarries by barge, oceangoing vessels or railroad. We shipped 231.0 million tons
in 22 states, the District of Columbia, Mexico and the Bahamas from 334 aggregates
production facilities and sales yards. The 10 largest states that we serve, measured by aggregates
shipments, accounted for 85% of total aggregates shipments.

At the end of 2007, we operated 183 crushed stone plants, 51 sand and gravel plants and 16
plants producing other aggregates (principally recycled concrete). Reserves largely determine the
ongoing viability of an aggregates business. For a discussion of our estimated proven and probable
aggregates reserves as of the end of 2007, see Item 2
“Properties” beginning on page 12 below. Our current
estimate of 12.7 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase
of 4.5 billion tons since the end of 1997. During that same period (1998-2007) we produced
approximately 2.3 billion tons of aggregates. We believe that these reserves are sufficient to
last, on average, 43 years at current annual production rates. We do not anticipate any material
difficulties in the availability of raw materials in the near future.

In addition to our 250 aggregates production facilities, at the end of 2007, we operated 84
truck, rail and water distribution yards, located in select markets for the sale of aggregates.
Additionally, at the end of 2007, our Aggregates segment included 15 aggregates related operations
for equipment service and repair, landfill and transportation.

Zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction
aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets.
Although we cannot predict future governmental policies affecting the construction materials
industry, we believe that future zoning and permitting costs will not have a materially adverse
effect on our business. However, future land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning
and permitting more difficult. Any such restrictions, while potentially curtailing expansion in
certain areas, could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations.

We strive to maintain a sufficient level of aggregates inventory to meet delivery requirements
of our customers. We generally provide our customers with 30-day payment terms, similar to those
customary for the construction aggregates industry.

Asphalt mix and Concrete Segment Overview

The Asphalt mix and Concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete
in four regional divisions serving 10 states primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Florida, southwestern
and western markets, the Bahamas and the District of Columbia. Additionally, two of the divisions
produce and sell other concrete products such as block, prestressed and precast and resell
purchased building materials related to the use of ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.
Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 78% of ready-mixed concrete by
weight. Our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment is almost wholly supplied with its aggregates
requirements from our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices
for the particular grade and quality of material utilized in the production of asphalt mix and
concrete. Customers for our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment are generally served locally from our
production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly,
delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately 20 to 25 miles
from the producing facility. Our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment constituted approximately 25%,
25% and 24% of our net dollar sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The crushed rock, sand and gravel used as raw materials by our Asphalt mix and Concrete
segment are almost wholly supplied by our Aggregates segment. Therefore, like the Aggregates
segment, the Asphalt mix and Concrete segment relies upon our reserves of aggregates. Concrete
production also requires cement, which is supplied substantially internally by our Florida Rock
Division in the Florida market. The asphalt production process also requires liquid asphalt. We do
not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment
to operate.

Cement Segment Overview

Our Newberry, Florida cement plant produces Portland and masonry cement which is sold in both
bulk form and bags to the concrete products industry. The Brooksville, Florida plant produces
calcium products for the animal feed, paint,



plastics and joint compound industries. The Tampa facility imports cement and slag where some
of the imported cement is resold and the balance of the cement is blended, bagged or reprocessed
into specialty cements which are then sold. The slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended
form. The Port Manatee, Florida plant imports clinker that is ground into bulk cement and sold.

The
Cement segment’s largest customer is our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment.

The production capacity at the Newberry facility is being doubled. Construction began on this
project in fiscal 2006 and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2009. The Newberry cement
plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility. The cement plant limestone reserves at the
Newberry facility total 130,174,000 tons, or 50 years of
life at expected production rates based on the increased plant
capacity.

The Brooksville calcium facility is supplied by high quality calcium carbonate material mined
at the Brooksville quarry. The calcium carbonate reserves at this quarry total approximately 7
million tons, or 10 years of life at expected production rates
and based on lease termination.

As shown in the table above, primary end uses for our products include public construction,
such as highways, bridges, airports, schools and prisons, as well as private nonresidential (e.g.,
manufacturing, retail, offices, industrial and institutional) and private residential construction
(i.e., single-family and multi-family). Following is a more detailed discussion of the most
significant of these end uses.

Public

— This construction end use market is generally the most aggregates intensive.
Historically, public sector construction spending has been more stable than in the private end use
markets, in part because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates. In 2007,
publicly funded construction accounted for 47% of our total aggregates shipments. Public
construction projects are typically funded through a combination of federal, state and local
sources. The federal highway bill is the principal source of federal funding for public
infrastructure and transportation projects. Federal highway spending is determined by a six-year
authorization bill, now covering fiscal years 2004-2009, and annual budget appropriations using
funds largely taken from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which receives taxes on gasoline and other
levies. Specific highway and bridge projects are typically managed by state transportation
departments, which obligate their portion of federal revenues and supplement this federal funding
with state fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees and general fund appropriations. States also
transfer funds to counties and municipalities to fund local street construction and maintenance.
The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on
individual state needs and economies. Other public infrastructure construction includes airports,
sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and government buildings.
Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources.

Private Nonresidential

— This construction end use market includes a wide array of project
types and generally is more aggregates intensive than residential construction. Economic factors
such as job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends help drive
overall demand for private nonresidential construction. In 2007, private nonresidential
construction accounted for 31% of our total aggregates shipments. Strong corporate profits and
growth of the private workforce generate demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise,
population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as
well as schools, hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. A new manufacturing facility in
an area generally generates demand for other manufacturing plants to supply its parts and
assemblies. Additionally, construction activity in this end use market is influenced by a firm’s
ability to finance and the cost of financing.

Private Residential

— Approximately 80-85% of all residential construction activity is for
single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multifamily (i.e., two-family houses,
apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises a small portion of the housing
supply. Household formation is a primary driver of housing demand along with mortgage rates. In the
last 10 years, the number of new households has increased 12% from 102 million to 114 million in
the U. S. and 15%, on average, in the markets we serve. Construction activity in this end use
market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing. Demand for our products
generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of
the foundation, driveway or parking lot. In 2007, private residential construction accounted for
19% of our total aggregates shipments.

Other End Uses

— Ballast is sold to railroads for construction and maintenance of track.
Riprap and jetty stone are sold for erosion control along waterways. Stone also can be used as a
feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders.
Coal-burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is
crushed to a fine powder also can be sold as agricultural lime. In 2007, these other end uses
accounted for 3% of our total aggregates shipments.

Financial Results

Net sales, total revenues, earnings from continuing operations, earnings from continuing
operations per common share, total assets, long-term obligations and cash dividends declared per
common share for the five years ended December 31, 2007, are reported under Item 6, “Selected
Financial Data” below.



Competition and Customers

The products of all of our reporting segments are marketed under highly competitive
conditions, including competition in price, service and product performance. In most of the markets
we serve, there are a substantial number of competitors.

We are the largest construction aggregates producer in the United States. We estimate that
the 10 largest aggregates producers in the nation supply approximately 35% to 40% of the total
national market. There are many small, independent producers of aggregates, resulting in highly
fragmented markets in some areas. Therefore, depending on the market, we may compete with a number
of large regional and small local producers. Since construction aggregates are expensive to
transport relative to their value, an important competitive factor in the construction aggregates
business is the transportation cost necessary to deliver product to the location where it is used.
We focus on serving metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest
absolute growth in population in the future. We have aggregates production facilities located on
rail lines and waterways, which substantially increase our geographic market reach through the
availability of rail and water transportation. We sell a relatively small amount of construction
aggregates outside of the United States. Long-lived assets outside the United States are reported
in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 69 of our 2007 Annual Report to
Shareholders and are hereby incorporated by reference.

The customers for each of our reporting segments and the methods of distribution to such
customers are detailed in the table on page 4 of this report. No material part of our business is
dependent upon one or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on
our business. In 2007, our top five customers accounted for less than 10% of our total sales, and
no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our total sales. Our products are sold
principally to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although historically
over 40% of our sales has gone into publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and
government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or
municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding of
publicly funded construction can curtail construction spending, our business is not subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts as a result of state or federal government
elections.

Research and Development Costs

We conduct research and development and technical service activities at our facility in
Birmingham, Alabama. In general, our research and development efforts are directed toward new and
more efficient uses of our products. We spent approximately $1,617,000 in 2007, $1,704,000 in 2006,
and $1,554,000 in 2005 on such activities.

Environmental Costs and Governmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
environment and to health and safety, including noise, water discharge, air quality, dust control,
zoning and permitting. We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
in 2008 and 2009 will be approximately $17,397,000 and $17,221,000, respectively.

Frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to
reclaim our former mining sites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No.143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” these reclamation liabilities are
recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair
value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the
owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To
determine the fair value, we estimate the cost of a third party to perform the legally required
reclamation, adjusted for inflation and risk and including a reasonable profit margin. All
reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. See Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements on pages 49 and 70, respectively, of the 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders.
Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as
reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been
factored in to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.



Acquisitions/Divestitures

In 2007, we spent approximately $4,737.3 million on acquisitions. These acquisitions included
Florida Rock Industries at $4.2 million (total cash and stock consideration paid) and smaller
bolt-on acquisitions in North Carolina and Illinois totaling $58.9 million. In addition to these
cash acquisitions, during 2007, we acquired an aggregates production facility in Alabama in
exchange for two aggregates production facilities in Illinois. We had no material divestitures in
2007.

As a condition to the Florida Rock merger, we were required by the U. S. Department of Justice
to divest nine sites owned by Florida Rock and Legacy Vulcan. During
the first half of 2008, we
expect to complete these divestitures in a series of transactions. We currently expect these
divestitures to be a combination of cash sales and asset swaps.

Seasonality of Our Business

Virtually all our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Our financial results for any
individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year, due
primarily to the effect that seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can have on the
production and sales volume of our products. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are attained
in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter. Our sales and earnings are
sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings
in construction spending. These cyclical swings are further affected by fluctuations in interest
rates, and demographic and population fluctuations.

Patents and Trademarks

As of February 28, 2008, we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents,
trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.

Other Information Regarding Vulcan

Our principal sources of energy are electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel. We do not
anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for our operation of any of our
reporting segments.

As of January 1, 2008, we employed 10,522 people. Of these employees, 1,275 are represented by
labor unions. We do not anticipate any significant issues with such unions in 2008.

We do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to, or a significant factor in,
evaluating and understanding our business.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the following
risks, together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before
deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. If any of these risks
actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected. In such an event, the trading prices of our common stock could decline, and you
might lose all or part of your investment.

Risks and Uncertainties Related to the Mergers.

We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers.

The mergers involve the integration of two companies that previously have operated
independently, each with its own business, customers, employees, culture and systems. To realize
the anticipated benefits from the mergers, we must successfully combine the businesses of Legacy
Vulcan and Florida Rock in a manner that permits, among other things, earnings growth and cost
savings. In addition, we must achieve these savings without adversely affecting revenues. If we are
not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not
be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

The failure to integrate successfully Legacy Vulcan’s and Florida Rock’s businesses and operations
in the expected time frame may adversely affect Vulcan’s future results.

Until the completion of the mergers, Legacy Vulcan and Florida Rock operated independently. We
face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating their organizations, procedures
and operations in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key Legacy Vulcan and Florida Rock
personnel. The integration of Legacy Vulcan and Florida Rock will be costly, complex and time
consuming.

The integration process and other disruptions from the transaction could be more costly than
we expect or result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing
businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect
our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others with whom we
have business dealings or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers. Many of these
difficulties are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs,
decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which
could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Integrating Legacy Vulcan and Florida Rock may divert management’s attention away from our
operations.

Successful integration of Legacy Vulcan’s and Florida Rock’s organizations, procedures and
operations may place a significant burden on our management and its internal resources. The
integration efforts could divert management’s focus and resources from other strategic
opportunities and from operational matters during the integration process.

Our incurrence of additional debt to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration significantly
increased our interest expense, financial leverage and debt service requirements.

We established $4.0 billion of new credit facilities in connection with the mergers, and
borrowed $3.35 billion under such credit facilities in order to (i) acquire 70% of the outstanding
shares of Florida Rock common stock, (ii) settle for cash the Florida Rock stock options
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers and (iii) finance our
transaction costs. Incurrence of this new debt significantly increased our leverage. There may be
circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this new debt could
adversely affect our cash flows and operating results.



There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments. If we
fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated
indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under our debt
instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative
financing.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to
indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to
prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.

The costs of the mergers could adversely affect our operating results.

In connection with the mergers, we incurred certain costs, consisting of employee benefit
costs, investment banking, legal and accounting fees, and other related charges. In addition, we
will incur certain expenses in connection with the integration of Legacy Vulcan’s and Florida
Rock’s businesses, particularly relating to the management information systems.

Risks and Uncertainties Related to Other Aspects of Our Business.

The collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the slow recovery in residential construction
could continue to negatively affect our volumes.

In some of our markets, particularly Florida and California, sales volumes have been
negatively impacted by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the severe slowdown in
residential construction. Our sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and
negatively impacted by this segment of the market until these slowdowns in residential construction
improve.

A decline in public sector construction and reductions in governmental funding could adversely affect our
operations and results.

In
2007, 47% of our sales volume of construction aggregates was made to contractors on publicly funded
construction. If, as a result of a loss of funding or a significant reduction in state or federal budgets,
spending on publicly funded construction were to be reduced significantly, our earnings and cash flows
could be negatively affected.

Weather can materially affect our quarterly results.

Almost all of our products are used in the public or private construction industry, and our production and
distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and
distribute our products and affects our customers’ short-term demand since their work also can be hampered
by weather. Therefore, our results can be negatively affected by inclement weather.

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry.

The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local
producers in a number of our markets. However, in most markets, we also compete against large private and
public companies. This results in intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate.
Significant competition could lead to lower prices, lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets,
negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.

Our long-term success is dependent upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas.

Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of
the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except
for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by
rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites. New
quarry sites often take a number of years to develop, so our strategic planning and new site development
must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we
operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community
resistance.



Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high
growth in order to locate optimally facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental
permits to operate at those sites.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are
subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation.

In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel,
liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are
subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of
such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain
these materials due to higher demand or other factors interrupting their availability. Variability in the
supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period
and rising costs could erode our profitability.

We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could affect our future
financial results.

As discussed more fully in “Critical Accounting Policies” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” on pages 22 through 38 of our 2007 Annual Report to
Shareholders, we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment; impairment
of long-lived assets excluding goodwill; reclamation costs; pension and other postretirement benefits;
environmental compliance; claims and litigation including self-insurance; and income taxes. Although we
believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate
assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly
in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other
contingencies with certainty.

We are involved in several class action and complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous
ownership and operation of our Chemicals business. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005,
we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting
principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known
to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment
and estimates of a loss contingency. Furthermore, unfavorable results in one or more of these actions could
result in an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
For a description of our current legal proceedings see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” on pages 15 through 16 of
this report and Note 12, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” on pages 65 through 68 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years. Continuing
increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings.

The costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over
the past several years. We have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase. However, if these
costs continue to rise, this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

Our industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings
are highly sensitive to changes in volume.

Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for the extraction and production of construction
aggregates, profitability as measured in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales (“margins”) can
be greatly impacted due to changes in volume.



Our products generally must be transported by rail, truck, barge or ship, usually by third party providers.
Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our
operations and earnings.

Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to
remote markets. Costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our
control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity
constraints. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can
negatively impact our distribution network.

Our future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and
operations.

A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified
personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and
operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and
skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic
conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.

Changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use, environmental and other areas
of the laws impact our business.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Our operations are affected by
numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental
matters. Despite our compliance efforts there is the inherent risk of liability in the operation of our
business, especially from an environmental standpoint. These potential liabilities could have an adverse
impact on our operations and profitability. Our operations require numerous governmental approvals and
permits, which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance expenditures to comply with
zoning and environmental laws and regulations. Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent
interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, require additional
investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or
facilities.

Our future growth is dependent in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating
them with our existing operation.

As a result of the limited opportunities to establish greenfield quarry sites, expansion of our business is
dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own aggregate reserves. Our future results
will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our company.

Our
current estimate of approximately 12.7 billion tons of proven
and probable aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 1.3 billion tons from the estimate at the end of 2006. We believe
that the quantities of proven and probable reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to
result in an average life of approximately 43 years at present operating levels. In calculating the
average life of 43 years, we assumed an annual aggregates production rate of 297 million tons. See
Note 1 to the following table for a description of our method employed for estimating the life of
reserves. This table presents, by regional division, the estimated aggregates reserve life and the
percentage of aggregates reserves by rock type.

Estimated years of life of aggregates reserves are based on the average annual rate of production of each regional division for the most
recent three-year period, except that if reserves are acquired or if production has been reactivated during that period, the estimated
years of life are based on the annual rate of production from the date of such acquisition or reactivation. Revisions may be necessitated
by such occurrences as changes in zoning laws governing facility properties, changes in aggregates specifications required by major
customers and passage of government regulations applicable to aggregates operations. Estimates also are revised when and if additional
geological evidence indicates that a revision is necessary. For 2007, the total three-year average annual rate of production was 297
million tons based on annual rates of production as follows: 2007 — 277 million tons, 2006 — 305 million tons, and 2005 — 308 million
tons. These production rates include Florida Rock’s production for periods prior to the November 15, 2007 acquisition by Vulcan.

(2)

Other: argillite, basalt, diabase, diorite, gabbro, gneiss, latite, quartzite, rock asphalt, and traprock.

The foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel of suitable
quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers,
recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and
stone excavation.

Of the 234 permanent reserve-supplied aggregates production facilities which we operate, 83
(representing 47% of total reserves) are located on owned land, 52 (representing 24% of total
reserves) are on land owned in part and leased in part, and 99 (representing 29% of total reserves)
are on leased land. While some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted,
generally our leases have definite expiration dates, which range from 2008 to 2159. Most of our
leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion.

Due to transportation costs, the market areas for most aggregates facilities in the
construction aggregates industry are limited, often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one
or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only. The following table
provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on
the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves. None of the listed aggregates facilities
contributes more than 5% to our net sales.

tons, or 50 years of life at expected future production rates;
and the Brooksville, Florida quarry, which has calcium carbonate reserves of
7 million tons, or 10 years of life based on expected production
rates and a lease termination.

Other Properties

Our headquarters are located in an office complex in Birmingham, Alabama. The office space is
leased through December 31, 2013, with a five-year renewal period, and consists of approximately
184,125 square feet. The annual rental costs for the current term and the five-year renewal period
are $3.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational
safety and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to
noise abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of
stewardship in safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such
proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible
to determine with precision the outcome of, or the amount of liability, if any, under these
lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury
panels. In our opinion, the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows to a material extent. In
addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, certain
other legal proceedings are more specifically described below. Although the ultimate outcome is
uncertain, it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely
affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows to a material
extent.

On October 12, 2007, we reached an agreement with the city of Modesto in the case styled

City of Modesto, et al. v. Dow Chemical Company, et al.,

filed in San Francisco County
Superior Court, California, to resolve all claims against Vulcan for a sum of $20 million. The
agreement provides for a release and dismissal or withdrawal without prejudice of all claims
against Vulcan. The agreement also expressly states that the settlement paid by Vulcan is for
compensatory damages only and not for any punitive damages, and that Vulcan denies any conduct
capable of giving rise to an assignment of punitive damages. The settlement has been approved by
the San Francisco Superior Court judge presiding over this case and thus is now final. While we
believe the verdicts rendered and damages awarded during the first phase of the trial are contrary
to the evidence presented, we settled the city’s claims in order to avoid the costs and
uncertainties of protracted litigation. The $20 million was paid during the fourth quarter of
2007. We believe the settlement damages, legal defense costs, and other potential claims are
covered by insurance policies purchased by Vulcan, and we are pursuing recovery from these
insurers.

Although this agreement settles all claims against Vulcan by the city of Modesto related to
this litigation, certain potential ancillary claims related to this matter remain unresolved. At
this time, we cannot determine the likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss resulting from
any such claims.

In addition, on or about September 18, 2007, Vulcan was served with a third-party complaint
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California (Fresno Division). The
underlying action was brought by the United States of America on behalf of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency against various individuals associated with a dry cleaning facility in Modesto
called Halford’s, seeking “recovery of unreimbursed costs incurred by it for activities undertaken
in response to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the Modesto Groundwater
Superfund Site in Modesto, Stanislaus County, California.” The complaint also seeks certain civil
penalties against the named defendants. Vulcan was sued by the original defendants as a
third-party defendant in this action. No discovery has been conducted in this matter.

We have also recently been named as a defendant in the matter of

Garcia v. Dow Chemical
Company, et al.,

filed in Modesto, Stanislaus County, California. This is a wrongful death
action that generally alleges that the water supply and environment in the city of Modesto were
contaminated with toxic chlorinated solvents by the defendants, including Vulcan, and that Ms.
Garcia was “hurt and injured in her health” as a result of exposure to said solvents. No discovery
has been conducted in this matter.

We produced and marketed industrial sand from 1988 to 1994. Since 1993 we have been sued in
numerous suits in a number of states by plaintiffs alleging that they contracted silicosis or
incurred personal injuries as a result of exposure to, or use of, industrial sand used for abrasive
blasting. As of January 17, 2008, the number of suits totaled 88 involving an aggregate of 554
plaintiffs. There are 51 pending suits with 494 plaintiffs filed in Texas. Those Texas cases are
in a State Multidistrict Litigation Court and are stayed until discovery issues are resolved. The
balance of the suits have been brought in California, Florida and Louisiana. We are seeking
dismissal of all suits on the grounds that plaintiffs were not exposed to our product. To date we
have been successful in getting dismissals from cases involving approximately 17,000 plaintiffs
with little or no payments made in settlement.



We have been named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed in 2001 and 2002 in state court
and federal district court in Louisiana. The lawsuits claim damages for various personal injuries
allegedly resulting from releases of chemicals at our former Geismar, Louisiana plant in 2001. A
trial for the issues of causation and damages for ten plaintiffs was held in July 2004. Five of
these plaintiffs were dismissed during the trial. A jury awarded the remaining five plaintiffs an
aggregate award of $201,000. In November 2006, the trial court approved a settlement class with
most of the remaining plaintiffs in the matter. A court-appointed special master is overseeing the
settlement process of the November 2006 approved settlement class. A second settlement class was
approved by the Court in 2007 and a court appointed special master is also overseeing the
settlement of this second class. Vulcan paid its insurance deductible as a part of the settlements
in 2006, and our insurers are funding the settlements beyond this deductible.

In September 2001, we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the Illinois Department of
Transportation (IDOT), in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division, Illinois, alleging
damage to a 0.9-mile section of Joliet Road that bisects our McCook quarry in McCook, Illinois, a
Chicago suburb. IDOT seeks damages to “repair, restore, and maintain” the road or, in the
alternative, judgment for the cost to “improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate” vehicles
that previously used the road. The complaint also requests that the court enjoin any McCook quarry
operations that will further damage the road. The court in this case granted summary judgment in
favor of Vulcan on certain claims. The court also granted the plaintiff’s motion to amend their
complaint to add a punitive damages claim, although the court made it clear that it was not ruling
on the merits of this claim. Discovery is ongoing and no trial date has been set.

On March 22, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (in a
case captioned

Sierra Club, National Resources Defense Council and National Parks Conservation
Association v. Lt. Gen. Carl A. Stock, et al.)

ruled that the mining permit issued for our
Miami quarry, which was acquired in the Florida Rock transaction in November 2007, as well as
several permits issued to competitors in the same region, had been improperly issued. The Court
remanded the permitting process to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps of Engineers”) for
further review and consideration. On July 13, 2007, the Court ordered us to cease most mining
excavation at our Miami quarry, effective on July 17, 2007, pending the issuance by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (“SEIS”). The order suspends
our ability to excavate a substantial amount of reserves at this site; however, certain reserve
deposits as well as material excavated prior to the order remain accessible for mining and
processing. The court based its decision to shut down mining activity at the Miami quarry and two
quarries owned by competitors on concern that levels of benzene had been detected in an area of the
Biscayne Aquifer known as the Northwest Wellfield, which supplies a significant portion of the
water supply to the Miami area. At this time, we do not have any information to indicate that the
benzene was produced by our mining activities or that the levels of benzene pose a risk to human
health. The District Court decision was appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, and oral arguments were held before a panel in Miami on November 28, 2007. We are
currently awaiting a decision from the court.

Florida Rock Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of Vulcan, and the members of its board of
directors prior to the merger with Legacy Vulcan, were named in a purported shareholder class
action complaint filed in Florida state court (the Duval County Circuit Court) on March 6, 2007,
captioned

Dillinger v. Florida Rock, et al.

The complaint sought to enjoin the merger
between Florida Rock and Vulcan that was consummated on November 16, 2007. The complaint alleges,
among other things, that the former Florida Rock directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to
Florida Rock’s shareholders by selling Florida Rock to Legacy Vulcan for an inadequate price.

We believe this lawsuit is without merit but have determined to seek a settlement to avoid the
expense, risk, inconvenience and distraction of continued litigation. Accordingly, the parties
have entered into a memorandum of understanding providing for the settlement of the lawsuit and
have agreed to seek final court approval of the settlement and dismissal of the lawsuit on the
terms set forth in the memorandum. Pursuant to the memorandum, Florida Rock agreed to include
additional requested disclosure in its proxy statement for the special meeting of shareholders at
which the merger agreement was approved, and to pay plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees. When this
memorandum is approved by the Court, the lawsuit will be dismissed with prejudice and all other
claims, whether legal or equitable, which the plaintiffs or any member of the purported class may
have in connection with the merger of the proxy statement, will be released.

Note 12, “Other Commitments and Contingencies” on pages 65 through 68 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements is hereby incorporated by reference.

Our policy is to pay out a reasonable share of net cash provided by operating activities as
dividends, consistent on average with the payout record of past years, while maintaining debt
ratios within what we believe to be prudent and generally acceptable limits. The future payment of
dividends, however, will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on our
profitability, capital requirements, financial condition, growth, business opportunities and other
factors which our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We are not a party to any contracts or
agreements that currently materially limit, or are likely to limit in the future, our ability to
pay dividends.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

We did not have any repurchases of stock during the fourth quarter of 2007. We did not have
any unregistered sales of equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d -15(e)),
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other management officials,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2007. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and
reliability of the published financial statements. We assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, we
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control
— Integrated Framework

. We have excluded from the scope of
our assessment of internal control over financial reporting the
operations and related assets of Florida Rock which we acquired on
November 16, 2007. At December 31, 2007, and for the period
from November 16 through December 31, 2007, total assets
and total revenues subject to our internal control over financial
reporting represented 18% and 2% of our consolidated total assets and
total revenues, respectively, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2007. Based on our assessment, our Management
believes that, as of December 31, 2007, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria.

Reporting” on page 39 of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, “Report of Independent Registered
