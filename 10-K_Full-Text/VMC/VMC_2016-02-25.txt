ITEM 1

BUSINESS

Vulcan Materials Company

,

a New Jersey corporation

, is

the nation’s

largest produ

cer of construction aggregates

(

primarily crushed stone,

san

d

and gravel

)

and

a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed

concrete

.

As of December 31, 2015, we had


active

a

ggregates facilities

.

VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION

We are

t

he

largest producer of construction aggregates

in the country with

coast-to-coast

aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:

§

a

favorable geographic footprint

serving nearly all key growth corridors and

the

most rapidly growing population centers

§

a pure-play aggregates business with one of the largest proven and probable reserve bases in the U.S.

§

excellent multi-modal logistics capabilities, plus the inherent advantages of our Playa del Carmen, Mexico quarry and supporting port facilities

These factors, together with our strong operating expertise and price discipline, allow us to deliver the highest margins per ton shipped in the industry.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

§

Our

aggregates

reserves are strategically located throughout the United States i

n a

reas

that are projected to grow faster than the national average and

that require large amounts of aggregates to meet

construction

demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate


% of the total growth in U.S. population and


% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between


and

Part I


§

We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow

more

rapidly and

by

divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 201

5, we

completed a swap of twelve ready-mixed concrete plants in California for thirteen asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. We also acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete plants in Arizona and New Mexico. These transactions

,

together with acquisitions completed in 2014,

position us a

s th

e #1

aggregates supplier

in the New Mexico market and a leading

aggregates supplier

in Arizona.

§

W

here practical, we have operations located

close to our local markets because the cost of trucking

materials long distances is prohibitive.

Approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively

from the producing location to the customer

by truck, and another


%

are delivered by truck after reaching a

sales

yard by rail or water

.

The remaining


% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

COMPETITORS

We operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies.

We estimate that the ten largest aggrega

tes producers account

ed

for approximately


% to


%

of to

tal U.S. aggregates production

in 201


. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than


%.

O

ther publicly

traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

§

Cemex

S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH

plc

§

Heidelberg

Cement AG

§

Lafarge

Holcim

§

Martin Marietta Materials

, Inc.

§

MDU Resources

Group, Inc.

§

Summit Materials

, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with

over

5,900

companies managing

almost 11,000

operations

during 201


, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by

acquiring existing facilities to

enter new markets or

by

extending

their

existing

market positions.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to

maintain and

expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy

and competitive advantages are

based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in

most

types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and a

irports that connect us, and to

build the hospitals, churches,

schools,

shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our lives and the

economy.

business strategies

Our

business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4)

managing volume, product

mix

and price to grow profitability

, and 5) effective land management.

1.

AGGREGATES FOCUS

Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio

n a

nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist. Our focus on aggregates allows

us to

Part I


TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER

:

Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular

geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce

saleable aggregates and provide customer

service. Vulcan

is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., measured by shipments. Our


active aggregates facilities as of December 31, 2015 provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting,

procurement

, technical support and engineering.

2.

COAST-TO-COAST FOOTPRINT

Demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly. Our strategic locations serve

nineteen

of the top 25

highest-growth

U.S. metropolitan areas and as shown below, we serve

twenty

states

plus the District of Columbia

.

3.

PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our

long-term

growth is a result of

strategic

acquisition

s a

nd

investments in key operations

.

Strategic

acquisitions

AND DISPOSITIONS

:

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California

and

Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt

mix. In

2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and

our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in

other southeastern and

m

id-Atlantic

states

. In 2014, we completed eight transactions that expanded our aggregates

busin

ess in Arizona, California, New

Part I


Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.

C., our

asphalt mix

business in Arizona and New Mexic

o, a

nd

our

ready-mixed concrete

business in New Mexico

.

In

January

2015, we

completed an asset exchange transaction in which we

exited our ready-mixed concrete business in California

and

added thirteen asphalt plant locations, primarily in

Arizona.

Additionally, throughout our history

we have completed many bolt-on acquisitions that have c

ontributed significantly to our growth.

For example, in 2015 we completed strategic bolt-on acquisitions in Arizona, New Mexico and Tennessee.

MANAGING VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICE TO GROW PROFITABILITY

We

focus on three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination.

§

Price for Service

—

We seek to receive full and fair value for the quality of products and service we provide. We should be paid appropriately for helping our customers be successful.

§

Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

We focus on rigorous cost management throughout the economic cycle. Small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions.

§

Sales and Production Mix

—

We adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions. Managing inventories responsibly results in improved cost performance and an improved return on capital.

We manage these factors locally, and align our talent and incentives accordingly. Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively. Recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit drivers.

While Aggregates segment gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past couple of years, we

expect continuing improvement in unit profitability.

§

On Price for Service

—

Our expanding margins have just begun to benefit from the mid-to-high single digit price gains associated with cyclical recoveries.

§

On Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

We are operating a capital-intensive business at


-


% capacity and are extremely well positioned to further leverage fixed costs to sales as we move forward.

§

On Sales and Production Mix

—

As the recovery continues and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity in the

end-use

mix, we will sell the entire production mix much more efficiently and at fuller value.

5.

EFFECTIVE

LA

ND MANAGEMENT

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning

because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue t

o fo

cus our actions on

prudent

decisions regarding the life cycle management of

the 120,000 acres of land we currently own.

PRODUCT LINES

We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines:

1.

Aggregates

2.

Asphalt Mix

3.

Concrete

4.

Calcium

See Note 15 "Segment Reporting" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

1. AGGREGATES

Our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways:

§

as a base material underneath highways, walkways, airport runways, parking lots and railroads

§

to aid in water filtration, purification and erosion control

§

as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life including:

§

houses and apartments

§

roads, bridges and parking lots

§

schools and hospitals

§

commercial buildings and retail space

§

sewer systems

§

airports and runways

Part I


Factors that affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our business, include:

§

Local markets:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, are produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to long-haul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our Playa del Carmen quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan

Peninsula with our

fleet of Panamax-class, self-unloading ships

.

We operate an extensive logistics network along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard as shown below:

§

Lo

cation and quality of reserves:

We

currently ha

ve

15.7

billion

tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other developmen

t. Z

oning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restriction

s c

urtail expansion in certain areas, but th

ey al

so increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

§

Demand cycles:

Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new historical high.

Part I


§

Flexible production capabilities:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

Highly fragmented industry:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over

5,900

companies that manage

almost 11,000

operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

Limited product substitution:

There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, due to technical specifications many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete, but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities. Moreover, the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications.

§

raw material inputs largely under our control:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.

AGGREGATES MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with above-average long-term expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail, barge or ship to a particular end market. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

Public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatel

y-f

unded construction, and generally requires

more aggregates per dollar of construction spending.

Private sector construction

(primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically

is

more affected by general

economic cycles than

p

ublicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges

), w

hich

tend to

receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

Part I


PUBLIC SECTOR

CONSTRUCTION

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways,

bridges

, buildings and

airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and

private sources. In 2015

, publicly funded construction

accounted for

approximately


%

of

our total aggregates

shipments.

§

Public Sector Funding:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal

surface

transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over

four

decades,

a portion of transportation

projects ha

s

been funded through a series of multi-year bills.

Some


% of transportation projects are federally-funded, with special emphasis given to the largest and most complex projects.

The long-term

nature of such legislation

is

important

because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-

range

, com

plex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This

T

rust

Fund

receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 201


,

approximately


%

of

our aggregates sales by volume

were

used in highway construction projects.

§

federal highway funding

:

On December 4, 2015, the President signed a new, long-term federal highway bill into law. The final legislation, Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Infrastructure Act (FAST Act), received strong, bipartisan support in both the House and the

Senate.

The Federal-Aid Highway Program is the largest component of the law and has provided, on average, 52% of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years. The FAST Act increases Federal-Aid Highway Program funding from $41 billion in the federal fiscal year (FFY)


to $47 billion in FFY 2020. This spending is supported by the current user-fee revenue streams (excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, taxes on heavy truck sales and use, and heavy truck tire taxes, totaling some $208 billion) and by a $70 billion transfer of general funds to the

F

ederal Highway Trust Fund. The funding levels and five years of stability will help to rebuild America’s aging infrastructure and protect millions of jobs.

The FAST Act also contains important policy changes. To further accelerate the project delivery process, it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act (MAP-21). The new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects—particularly freight projects. In states where Vulcan operates, we are well-positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this FAST Act funding.

Although the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program was reduced to $275 million, growing to $300 million by 2020, the authorization is still in line with the previous program outlays and remains an important additional component of overall spending. The FAST Act also created a new National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue public-private partnerships and other financing arrangements.

§

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE:

In 2014 we, along with numerous business allies, strongly supported the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) for its importance to the U.S. economy

and

the pressing need to upgrade U.S. harbors, ports and inland waterway

s. C

ongress created a five-year pilot program to promote private-sector participation in water projects:

the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (WIFIA). Modeled after

the

highly popular

TIFIA

program in the surface transportation secto

r, W

IFIA allows for federal credit assistance to water resources projects in the form of low-cost loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit.

Unlike TIFIA, WIFIA as originally crafted did not allow for federal credit assistance to projects financed, in whole or in part, by tax exempt municipal bonds. The FAST Act lifts that restriction and should make it easier for project sponsors to use the credit program and advance water projects that would otherwise go unaddressed due to the lack of resources.

Part I


Private sector

CONSTRUCTION

The private sector

construction

market

s i

nclude both nonresidential building

construction

and residential construction and

are

considerably

more cyclical than public construction. In 201


, privately-funded construction accounted

for

approximately


%

of our

total aggregates shipments.

§

Nonresidential Construction:

Private nonresidential

building

construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction

.

Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally

is

driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

This end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

Nonresidential construction is expected to continue to be a stable source of volume growth in 2016 based on the following assumptions: (1) continuing employment growth should provide support, as it has in the past, (2) current backlogs that our customers and industry groups are reporting should continue to be a source of demand in 201

6 a

nd (3) growing state and local tax revenues should provide local governments with the funds to make capital investments in schools and other public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

§

Residential Construction:

The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in

our m

arkets

continue to outpace household formations in

the

rest of the

U

nited

S

tates

.

Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage

financing.

U.S.

housing starts, as measured by

Dodge Analytics

data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than

0.6 million

units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.

In 2015, total

annual

housing starts increased to

more than 1.1

million

unit

s.

The growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS

We sell

aggregates that are used as

balla

st fo

r construction and maintenance of railroad track

s

. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along

roads and

waterways.

In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use

limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a

fine powder can be sold as

agricultural lime.

We

sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "

Segment Reporting

"

in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Part I



. ASPHALT MIX

We produce and sell asphalt mix

in

Arizona, California,

New Mexico

and Texas

. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately

95%

by weight

of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt

M

ix segment

primarily

through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery

typically is within close proximity

to the producing facility.

The asphalt

mix

production process requires liquid asphalt

cement

, which we purchas

e fr

om third-party producers.

We do not anticipate any

significant

difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

We serve our Asphalt

M

ix segment customers from our local production facilities.


.

CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete

in

Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia, Washington D.C. and the Bahamas. In May 2015, we entered the Arizona ready-mixed concrete market

through the acquisition of

ready-mixed concrete operations in

conjunction with the acquisition of aggregates operations in

Arizona and New Mexico. In January 2015, we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona.

In March 2014, we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area. For additional details see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 80% by weight of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment primarily through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for

the particular grade and quality of material required.

We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility.

Ready-

mixed concrete production also requires cement

which w

e purchase

from

third-

party

producers

. We do not anticipate any

significant

difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

industries with

high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville

quarry.

RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all

of

our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart

er. Fu

rthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by

a number of factors including

changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.

Part I


CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business

depends

upon any

single

customer whose loss would have

a significant

adverse effect on our business. In 201


, ou

r f

ive

largest

customers accounted

for

7.0

%

of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than

2.3

%

of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately


% to


%

of our

aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to

numerous

federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the

environment and

worker

health and saf

ety;

examples include

regulation of

facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both

Mine Safety and Health Administration (

MSHA

)

and

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (

OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs.

We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201


and 201


will be approximately

$

12.5

million and $

15.4

million, respectively

. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have

a

material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents,

registered

trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.

ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment.

The following is a list of our risk factors.

EC

ONOMIC/POLITICAL

RISKS

Changes

in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures

—

Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations

are subject to environmental, zoning and land use requirements and

require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capit

al an

d operating

expenditures to comply with

the applicable requirements.

Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede

our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities.

Our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure

—

Our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal, state and local governments.

Congress recently passed a five-year, fully funded bill to invest in roads, bridges and public transportation. The resulting certainty and

the

modestly increased investment

are

positive development

s

and mitigat

e

risk in this area. In addition,

eleven

Vulcan-served

states successfully increased transportation funding between 2013 and the present; similar efforts are expected in at least three other states in our service area in 2016. However, given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects.

Climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business —

A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a "cap and trade" system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions

.

Other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts, such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity.

The impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate chang

e l

egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position,

results of operations or

cash flows.

GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs

—

The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are

significantly

vertically integrate

d.

Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices

and

lower sales volum

es in

some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash

flows.

The

expanded use of

aggregates

substitutes

could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations

—

Recycled concrete and asphalt mix are increasingly being used in a number of our markets, particularly urban markets, as a substitute for aggregates. The use of recycled concrete and asphalt mix could cause a significant reduction

in

the demand for

aggregates

.

Part I


Our

long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our

future

earnings

—

Constru

ct

ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the

products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry si

tes often take years to develop

;

therefore

,

our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.

Our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings

—

The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results w

ill depend i

n part on our ability

to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.

FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS

Our

industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume

—

Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates,

our profits and profit margins are

negatively affected by

significant

decreases in volume.

Significant downturn

in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill

—

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair

value

of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have

not

identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 20



tha

t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value,

a significant downturn

in the construction industry may have a

material

effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of

goodwill.

We

have substantial debt and our credit ratings are non-investment grade

—

Our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments depends on our financial performance.

Financial performance is, in turn, subject to general economic and business conditions, many of which are outside of our control.

Our ability to refinance maturing debt depends on our financial performance and the state of the non-investment grade debt

market, which is more volatile than the investment-grade debt market

.

Our debt instruments contain

customary

covenants, including:

affirmative (e.g., maintain insurance), negative (e.g.,

to

limi

t

our ability to incur secured debt

), informational (e.g., provide financial statements) and financial (e.g., minimum EBITDA to interest ratio) covenants. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, the r

elated debt could become due prior to its stated maturity, and our ability to obtain

alternative

or

additional

financing could be

impaired.

We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results

—

As discussed more fully in "Critical Accounting Policies" under Item


"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," we use significant

judgment in accounting for

:

§

g

oodwill and goodwill impairment

§

impairment of long-

lived assets excluding goodwill

§

reclamation

costs

§

pension and other postretirement benefits

§

environmental

compliance

§

claims and liti

gation including self-insurance

§

income taxes

Part I


We believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates; however, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and

could adversely affect our financial position

, results of operations, or cash flows.

PERSONNEL RISKS

Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations

—

A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics

of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit

packages.

We are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business

—

We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA). Failure to comply with the FCPA may result in legal claims against us. In addition, we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships, which may include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties impressed by foreign governments.

OTHER

RISKS

We are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks

—

Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of our systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an

infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect or business. Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations.

Weather can materially affect our operating results

—

Almost all of our products are

consumed outdoors

in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ short-term demand because their work also can be hampered

by weather.

Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings

—

Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets.

The c

osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability

—

In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors

that

interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability.

Part I


We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in several

complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals

and Metals

business

es

. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of

operations or cash flows. For a description

of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12

"

Commitments and Contingencies

"

We are involved in certain

environmental

matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty

—

We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or

disposal

.

As

required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

ITEM 1B

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We have

not

received any written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act of 1934 that remain unresolved.

Part I


ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

AGGREGATES

As the largest U.S. producer of construction aggregates, we have operating facilities across the U.S. and in Mexico and the

Bahamas. We principally serve mark

ets in


sta

tes,

Washington D.C.

and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the U.S. that are expected

to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates.

Our current estimate of

15.7

billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve

s

reflects

a

de

crease of

0.1

billion tons from

the prior year’s

estimate

.

Estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers, recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and subject to permit or other restrictions.

Part I


Proven, or measured, reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data, together with other direct and measurable observations

,

such as outcrops, trenches and quarry faces. The grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling, and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. Probable, or indicated, reserves are those reserves for which

quantity, grade

and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable, though not drilled, geologic evidence. The degree

of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation

.

Reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease, and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained. Leases, zoning, permits, reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas, depths and lengths of time allowed for mining, stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place, and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities, berms, and overburden or

waste storage, among other requirements and restrictions. Our reserve estimates take into account these factors. Technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis. For example, excessive overburden or weathered rock, rock quality issues, excessive mining depths, groundwater issues, overlying wetlands, endangered species habitats, and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable. In addition, computations for reserves in-place are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste.

The

15.7

billion tons of estimated

proven and probable

aggregates reserves reported at the end of



i

nclude reserves at inactive and greenfield (undeveloped)

sites. The

table below presents, by

division

, the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of December 31, 201


and the types of facilities operated.


In addition to the facilities included in the table above, we operate

EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND OUR FIVE CORE DISCIPLINES

In 201


,

we announced

a

n

executive leadership team

led by Tom Hill,

C

hairma

n

a

nd Chief Executive Officer. Joining

Mr. Hill o

n the leadership team

were

John McPherson (Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer), Stan Bass (

Chief Growth Officer

) and Michael Mills (

Chief Administrative Officer

).

Each member of the executive leadership team has significant senior-level general and industry specific business experience.

Under the leadership of ou

r e

xecutive leadership team, we have instituted the following five core disciplines that we focus on daily:

1. SALES AND MARKETING EXCELLENCE

Goal:

Remain the market supplier of choice in order to increase our market share while earning full and fair value for our products and services.

Execution:

We are winning more than our fair share of large project bids by leveraging our scale and extensive strong customer relationships.

2. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

Goal:

Lead the markets safest and most efficient operations by successfully leveraging and driving cost efficiencies to achieve 60% flow through of incremental aggregates revenue.

Execution:

We are driving our cost of revenues down by leveraging our purchasing power and multi-modal logistic

s

network and by better managing inventory levels.

In 2015, we exceeded our long-term flow through goal of 60% by achieving 77% flow through of incremental aggregates revenue on a same-store basis.

3.

S

ELLING

,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL

(SAG) PRODUCTIVITY

Goal:

Continue to leverage SAG in order to achieve 6% of revenues.

Execution:

We are leveraging our recently reorganized central shared services and recently implemented common ERP platform to reduc

e a

dministrative

expenses

and enable rapid integration of acquired operations. As a result, SAG as a percentage of

total

revenues has decreased from

9.


% in



to

8.4

% in 2015.

4. CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY

Goal:

Drive improvement in capital turnover while maintaining the longer term health of our asset base.

Execution:

We are improving capital turnover by maximizing the lifecycle value of land holdings and optimizing working capital and inventory levels.

5. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Goal:

Continue to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions and selectively enter new markets that meet our growth profile while divesting non-core businesses.

Execution:

In 2015, we completed a swap of twelve ready-mixed concrete plants in California for thirteen asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. We also acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete plants in Arizona and New Mexico. These transactions together with acquisitions completed in 2014,

position us as

the #1

aggregates supplier

in the New Mexico market and a leading

aggregates supplier

in Arizona.

Part I

I




ACQUISITIONS/DIVESTITU

R

ES

We continually challenge ourselves as to whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations

—

this logic supports the transaction we closed in January 2015

to exchange

our California

ready-mixed concrete operations for 13 asphalt

mix

plants, primarily in Arizona. We expect to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets due to our operational and strategic focus in the Arizona asphalt market.

In addition

,

we acquired the following in 2015:

§

three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in Arizona and New Mexico

§

one aggregates facility in Tennessee

For a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

AND OUTLOOK

We

expect overall demand growth in Vulcan-served markets to be approximately 7% in 2016, driven by continued growth in both private and public construction. Private construction activity should continue to grow in both residential and nonresidential, led by double-digit growth in

the

residential

sector

. Public construction in

our

markets should continue to benefit from state-led highway spending in key states and record levels of

state and

local tax receipts. Additionally, with the passage of

the

new, fully funded, long-term federal highway bill in December 2015,

the

states

now

have greater funding stability and certainty to undertake much needed transportation projects. As a result,

we

believe

that

mid-single digit growth for this aggregates-intensive end

-

market is possible in 2016

.

At this point in the recovery, the timing and pace of shipments throughout the year can be marginally more uncertain due to weather-related challenges and the start dates and shipping pace for certain large projects. For example, El Nino-related rainfall has negatively impacted early 2016 shipment rates in our California, Arizona and New Mexico operations. These factors, coupled with public transportation agencies needing time to adjust their project procurement schedules to incorporate passage of the new federal highway bill, could result in full year aggregates shipments being weighted towards the second half of the year.

We expect full year Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 to $1.1 billion driven by

: (1)

the continuing recovery in demand from the trough seen in 2012,

(2)

strong growth in aggregates gross profit per ton,

(3)

earnings improvement in our non-aggregates businesses and

(4)

continuing leverage of our SAG expenses.

The following assumptions, which represent the mid-point of our expectations, support our outlook for strong year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA in 20

16.

§

a

ggregates shipments of approximately 191 million tons, up 7% from 2015

§

i

ncrease in average freight-adjusted aggregates pricing of

7%

, with unit margins continuing to grow faster than pricing

§

a

ggregates gross profit growth of 25%

§

t

otal non-aggregates gross profit improvement of 20%

§

SAG expenses of approximately $295 million, excluding business development-related expenses

Other expectations include:

§

c

ore capital spending of approximately $275 million to support the increased level of shipments and further improve production costs and operating efficiencies

§

i

nterest expense of approximately $140 million

§

d

epreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense of approximately $285 million

§

e

ffective tax rate of 31

%

Our 2015 results and 2016 outlook are consistent with our long

-

range expectations. Since the beginning of this recovery in the second half of 2013, our teams’ efforts have res

ulted in trailing twelve month A

ggregates segment gross profit increasing nearly $400 million on a 38 million ton increase in annualized shipments.

We are encouraged by the ongoing recovery in demand continuing across our markets and by the positive pricing environment. Our teams continue to convert incremental revenue into incremental gross profit at an impressive rate.

Our focus will remain on continuous, compounding improvement –

both operational and financial.

At 178.3 million tons, our 2015 aggregates shipments increased 15.9 million tons. This increase is

With the exception of certain markets in Texas, construction activity in Vulcan-served markets remains well below long-term levels of per capita consumption. Key states such as California, Florida, and Georgia continue to enjoy solid growth rates as they gradually recover toward more normal levels of construction activity and materials consumption

We routinely arrange the delivery of our aggregates to the customer. Additionally, we incur transportation costs to move aggregates from the production site to remote distribution sites. These costs are passed on to our customers in the aggregates price. We remove these pass-through freight and transportation revenues (and any other

aggregates-derived

revenues, such as landfill tipping fees) from the freight-adjusted selling price for aggregates. See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this Item 7 for a reconciliation of freight-adjusted revenues.

Our pricing environment continues to improve with the steady increase in demand. During 2015, freight-adjusted sales price increased in all Vulcan-served states. On a same-store basis, freight-adjusted sales price also increased 7%.

Aggregates segment unit cost of sales, excluding freight and delivery, declined 1% in 2015 versus the prior year as lower diesel and energy costs offset higher fringe and overtime labor expenses and repair & maintenance costs.

Part I

I


Aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton increased 16% to $5.52 in 2015. This measure continues to improve, reflecting our effective management of the three major profit drivers (price for service; sales and production mix; operating efficiency and leverage). These efforts resulted in a record level of unit profitability that exceeds the level achieved in 2005 ($3.28 per ton – our peak year for volume) and in 20


($4.


per ton – our previous high). This trend further highlights the earnings potential of our aggregates business as volumes recover.

This aggregates earnings potential is further reflected in the flow-through rate. S

ame-store aggregates freight-adjusted

revenues increased $


1.9

million in 2015, while same-store gross profit for the segment increased $209.3 million, a flow-through rate of 77%. We have consistently exceeded our stated

long-term

goal of a 60% flow-through rate since volumes began to recover in the second half of 2013.

We experienced elevated SAG costs during 2015 primarily due to higher pension and other employee benefit costs, as well as continued investment in sales force effectiveness and other strategic initiatives. Other employee benefit costs, such as those associated with enhancements to the employee profit-sharing plan, also have risen. In contrast, direct SAG expenses for salaries and wages remained relatively flat with the prior year. We intend to further leverage SAG expenses to revenues as volumes recover.

As a percentage of total revenues, SAG expenses declined from 9.1% in 2014 to 8.4% in 201

INTEREST EXPENSE

in millions

Interest expense in 2015 decreased $22.8 million from 2014

due to a lower

weighted-average interest rate and a $5.8 million reduction in pretax charges for debt purchases.

Interest expense in 2015 and 2014 included pretax charges for debt purchases of $

67.1 million

and $72.9 million, respectively, as described in Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Stat

ements and Supplementary Data.”

INCOME TAXES

Our income tax

provision (

)

from continuing operations for

the

years ended December 31 is shown below:

The $3.3 million increase in our 2015 provision for incomes taxes is primarily related to the year-over-year improvement in our earnings from continuing operations

. The 2015 reduction in the effective tax rate is due to higher benefits from the statutory depletion deduction and the U.S. production deduction, both related to higher aggregates sales.

The $116.2 million increase in our 2014 income taxes is primarily related to the year-over-year improvement in our earnings from continuing operations.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Our sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial, committed bank line of credit. Additional financial resources include access to the capital markets, the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate, and dispositions of non-strategic operating assets. We believe

these

liquidity and

financial resources are sufficient to fund ou

for 201


, including:

§

cash contractual obligations

§

capital expenditures

§

debt service obligations

§

dividend payment

s

§

potential share repurchases

§

potential future acquisitions

Our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged from the prior year.

We intend

to take a balanced approach to capital deployment, one incorporating strategic reinvestment, sustained financial strength and flexibility, and the return of capital to shareholders.

In 2015, we returned $53.2 million in cash to shareholders though our dividend and $21.5 million through share repurchases. We expect to increase the return of capital through dividends

, share repurchases

, or other mechanisms, as earnings grow.

We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:

§

maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing

capacity

§

proactively

manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low

§

minimize

financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility

§

opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable

During 2015, we maintained debt of approximately $2.0 billion, eliminated nearer-term maturities, increased the weighted-average life of our debt obligations, and lowered our weighted-average interest rate by approximately 1% (100 basis points).

VERSUS 201


—

Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 was $50.8 million, a decrease of $500.3 million fro

, we refinanced $635.1 million principal amount of debt and entered into a new $750.0 million line of credit. The total cash requirement for these actions was $702.3 million ($635.1 million principal, $59.3 million of premiums above par and transaction fees of $7.9 million). We funded the refinancing by issuing $400.0 million of new 10-year notes, borrowing $235.0 million under our new and expanded line of credit and using $67.3 million of cash. Furthermore,

in 2014

we generated $30.6 million of cas

Net cash used for financing activities of $551.1 million increased $409.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase is primarily attributable to

the aforementioned

DEBT

Certain debt measures

as of December 31

are

payment beyond twelve months, as follows: December 31, 2015

—

$

235.0

million and December 31, 2014

—

$0.0 million.


The debt balances as of December 31, 2014 have been adjusted to reflect our early adoption of ASU 2015-03 and related election as disclosed in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption New Accounting Standards.


Reflects the margin above LIBOR for LIBOR-based borrowings; we also paid upfront fees that are amortized to interest expense and pay fees for unused borrowing capacity and standby letters of credit.

LINE OF CREDIT

In June 2015, we cancelled our secured $500.0 million line of credit and entered into an unsecured $750.0 million line of credit (incurring $2.6 million of transaction fees). The expanded borrowing capacity is part of the refinancing plans disclosed at our February 25, 2015 Investor Day (the 2015 refinancing plan

s). B

orrowings at December 31, 2015 are consistent with the 2015 refinancing plans and are intended to remain outstanding going forward.

The line of credit agreement expires in June 2020 and contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for an unsecured facility (none of which materially impact our ability to execute our strategic, operating and financial plans). The financial covenants are: (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA

of 3.5:1 through September 2016 and 3.25:1 thereafter

,

and (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net cash interest expense

of

3.0:1.

As of December 31, 2015, we

were

in

compliance with

the

line of credit covenants.

These refinancing actions are consistent with the aforementioned 2015 refinancing plans, resulted in total debt of approximately $

2.0

billion as of December 31, 2015 (consistent with year-end 2014) and have the following benefits, among others: (1) eliminate $621.1 million of debt maturities in 2015 – 2018

(including the $150.0 million notes refinanced as mentioned above)

, (2) extend the weighted-average life of our debt portfolio, and (3) lower our weighted-average interest rate.

The 2015 refinancing actions resulted in charges totaling $67.1 million. Such charges are detailed in Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and are presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In March 2014, we purchased $506.4 million principal amount of debt through a tender offer as described in Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” This debt purchase was funded by the aforementioned sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area and resulted in charges totaling $72.9 million (presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014).

DEBT PAYMENTS AND MATURITIES

Scheduled debt payments during 2015 included $150.0 million in December to retire the 10.125% notes (which were refinanced via long-term borrowings on our line of credit). Additionally, we refinanced $485.1 million of debt as described in Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1

"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

"

in Item 8

"

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.

We believe the

following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

1.

Goodwill and goodwill impairment

2.

Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

3.

Reclamation costs

4.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

5.

Environmental compliance

costs

6.

Claims and litigation including self-insurance

1.

GOODWILL AND

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is

less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2015, goodwill represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgment.

HOW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have identified


reporting units, of which


carry goodwill. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. We elected to perform

the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

STEP 1

We compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill

:

§

if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired

§

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any

STEP 2

We compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair valu

e representing implied goodwill:

§

if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

Part I

I


HOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE

First, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. Then, we estimate the fair values of the reporting uni

ts

using bo

th an income approach

(

which involves discounting estimated future cash flows

)

and a market

approach

(

which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies

)

.

W

e consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models

. Finally, to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization.

OUR FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS

We base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our

control, o

r u

nderperformance relative to historical or projecte

d o

perating results. These conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.

RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS

The results of our annual impairment tests for:

§

November 1, 201


indicated that the fair values of

all reporting units with goodwill

materially

exceeded

(

in excess of 50%

)

their carrying

values

§

November 1, 2014 indicated

that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially

exceeded

(

additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 18 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in Item 8 "Financial Statements

a

nd Supplementary Data."

2. IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of December 31, 201


,

net

p

roperty, plant & equipment

represents


% of total assets, while

net

other intangible assets

represents


% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates

, assumptions and judgment. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

Fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

Part I

I


We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impai

rment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g.

,

a

sphalt mix and

ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.

During 2015, we recorded a $

5.2

million loss on impairment of long-lived assets

resulting from

exiting a lease

.

During 201


, we recorded a $

3.1

million

impairment

loss

related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area, see Note 19 "Acquisitions and Divestitures" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

We recorded no asset impairments during 2013

.

We maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations. These assets

totaled $

373.0

million at December 31, 201


, representing an approximate


%

de

crease from December 31, 201


. Of the total

$

373.0

million

,

approximately


%

relates

to re

al estate held for future development and expansion of o

ur op

erations.

In

addition

, approximately



%

is comprised of real estate (principally former mining sites) pending development as commercial or residential real estate, reservoirs or landfills. The remaining



%

is composed of aggregates,

a

sphalt mix and

r

eady-mix

ed concrete

operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products. We anticipate moving

idled assets back into operation as demand recovers. We evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Note 4 "Property, Plant & Equipment" and Note 18 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in Item 8 "Financial

Statements and Supplementary Data.

"

3. RECLAMATION COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use

when

there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term

when

there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

Reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates, assumptions an

d j

udgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations ($

226.6

million as of December 31, 201

5 and $

226.6

million as of December 31, 2014

).

HOW WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost

(

including a reasonable profit margin

)

for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation task

s.

This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.

W

e evaluat

e c

urrent facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Note 17 "Asset Retirement Obligations" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

4. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Each year we review

the following primary

assumption

s:

§

DISCOUNT RATE

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of

projected

benefit paymen

ts

§

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

—

The expected

future return on plan assets reduce

s

the recorded net benefit costs

§

RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE

—

Annual pay increases after 2015 will not increase our pension plan obligations as a result of a 2013 plan amendment

§

RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE

BENEFITS

in the per capita

cost will

no

t i

ncrease ou

r po

stretirement medical benefits

obligation

as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level

HOW WE SET OUR ASSUMPTIONS

In selecting the discount rate, we consider

the yield on high-quality bonds with a duration equal to

the duration of plan liabilitie

s. A

t December 31, 201


, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from

3.53

% to

4.68

%

(December 31, 201


ranged from

3.50

% to

4.



%).

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 201


, the expected return on plan assets

remains at 7.50

%.

Changes

to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligation

s a

nd the annual ne

t b

enefit cost. The following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions:

As of the December 31,

During 2016, we expect to recognize net pensio

million and net postretirement

credit

of approximately $

(3.7)

million compared to

expenses of

$

15.9

million and $

0.2

million, respectively, in 2015. The

de

crease

s

are

primarily due to

a change in estimate.

Beginning in 2016, we are changing the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Historically, we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cos

t

,

a

pplying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows.

Part I

I


We are making this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding yield curve spot rates. This change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported.

We are accounting for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, are accounting for it prospectively starting in 2016. The estimated weighted-average discount rates

used

to measure servic

e a

nd interest cos

t

s

for 2016 are

4.89

% and

3.80

%, respectively, for our pension plans and

4.05

% and

2.81

%, respectively, for our other postretirement plans. The weighted

-

average discount rates that we would have used for service and interest costs under our prior estimation technique were

4.54

% for the pension plans and

3.69

% for the other postretirement plans. The reductions in benefit cost for 2016 associated with this change are estimated to be $

7.


million

and $

0.5

million

for our pension and other postretirement plans, respectively.

We do

not

anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 2016 and we do

not

anticipate making a discretionary contribution. We currently do

not

anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 "Benefit Plans" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

5. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

COSTS

Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs.

Our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

COSTS

To account for environmental

costs

, we:

§

expense or capitalize environmental

costs consistent

with our capitalization policy

§

expense

costs

for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues

§

accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost

At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur

, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study

. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 201


, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $

3.2

million.

Our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis.

Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates

and

key assumptions

in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. H

owever,

a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings an

d u

nanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 "Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Part I

I


6. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program

. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $

2.0

million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $

3.0

million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention

levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.

Our accounting policy for claims and litigation including self-insurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.

HOW WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS

We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

For additional information regarding claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"

under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance

.

7. INCOME TAXES

VALUATION OF OUR

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

We fil

e f

ederal, state and foreign income tax returns

and a

ccount for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met

hod.

We

recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities

(

which reflect our best assessment of th

e f

uture taxes we will pay

)

based on the differences between the financial statement

’s

carrying amounts

of assets and liabilities

and the

amounts used for income tax purposes

. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns

while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns.

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred

tax assets is included in Note 9 “Income Taxes” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

At December 31, 2015, we have state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of $

61.7

million, against which we have a valuation allowance of $

55.2

million. Of the deferred tax assets, $

58.9

million relates to Alabama.

From 2008 through the second quarter of 2015, we carried a full valuation allowance against the Alabama deferred tax asset for the following reasons:

§

due to our legal entity structure, we had no expectation of creating taxable income in Alabama

§

we had a substantial cumulative loss in Alabama

During the second quarter of 2015, we restructured our legal entities. Among other benefits, we anticipated that the restructuring would generate significant taxable income in Alabama, and therefore, allow for the utilization of some or all of the Alabama deferred tax asset.

Our Alabama cumulative loss is calculated as pretax earnings from continuing operations, discontinued operations and other comprehensive income plus permanent differences over the last three years. While evaluating all available positive and

Part I

I


negative evidence, realizing the significance of the restructuring in our Alabama income tax filing, we determined that

it was appropriate to adjust our Alabama cumulative loss calculation to consider the restructuring, remove pretax earnings fr

o

m discontinued operations and other comprehensive income and remove any other significant nonrecurring items. We refer to this calculation as our Alabama adjusted earnings.

At the end of the second quarter, our Alabama adjusted earnings were negative. However, the Alabama adjusted earnings loss was dramatically smaller than our Alabama cumulative loss. Of the three adjustments made, the restructuring had the greatest impact. In addition, we considered all other forms of positive and negative evidence, including the four sources of taxable income. The first three sources of taxable income (carryback potential, reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies) provided very little positive evidence. Because our Alabama adjusted earnings were a loss, we did not project future Alabama taxable income (the fourth source). As a result, during the second quarter we continued to carry a full valuation allowance against our Alabama deferred tax asset.

At the end of the third quarter, our Alabama adjusted earnings turned positive. This development

provided sufficient positive evidence such that we determined it was appropriate

to utilize projections of future Alabama taxable income

in our assessment

for the first time. However, because we had not yet returned to sustained profitability (i.e., three consecutive years of positive Alabama adjusted earnings) we used our Alabama

trailing twelve months

adjusted earnings as the basis for an objectively verifiable projection of future Alabama taxable income. This projection, in addition to considering all other positive and negative evidence, led us to conclude in the thir

d qu

art

er th

at it was more likely than not that $

4.7

million of the deferred tax asset was realizable. Therefore, we recognized

a deferred

tax benefi

t

of $4.7 millio

n i

n the third quarter

by reducing the valuation allowance

. Our fourth quarter analysis

further confirmed our third quarter conclusions but

resulted in no further

reductions

of the valuation allowance

.

We believe that i

f, or when, we have three consecutive years of positive Alabama adjusted earnings, we will

have sufficient positive evidence to

conclude that we have retur

ned to sustained profitability

and

will no longer limit

our estimate of future taxable incom

e t

o our Alabama

trailing twelve months

adjusted earnings.

At that time

, we expect to realize a significant portion, if not all, of the Alabama deferred tax asset.

We project that the earliest this could happen would be the fourth quarter of 2016.

L

IABILITY FOR

UNRECOGNIZ

ED TA

X BENEFITS

We recognize

a ta

x benefit associated with

a t

ax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained

based upon the technical merits of the position

. For a tax position that meets the

more likely than not

recognition threshold, w

e m

easure th

e

income

t

ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realiz

ed.

A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position.

Ou

r liability

for

u

nrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments a

nd new or emerging

legislation.

The

years open

to

tax

examinations

vary

by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is

appropriate

.

We

consider a

tax position

to

be resolved

at the earlier of

the issue being “effectively settled,”

settlement of an examination

,

or

the expiration of the statute of limitati

ons. Upon resolution

of a tax position, an

y

liability for

u

nrecognized tax benefits will be

released.

Ou

r liability for unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties

associated with our

liability for

unrecogniz

ed ta

x benefits as

income tax expense.

See the discussion in Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I, above.

ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. In order to manage these market risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

As discussed in the Liquidity and Financial Resources section of

Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"

we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and financial risk. Such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense. In addition to floating-rate borrowings under our line of credit, we at times utiliz

e i

nterest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt.

While floating-rate debt exposes us to rising interest rates, it is typically cheaper than issuing fixed-rate debt at any point in

time but can become more expensive than previously issued fixed-rate debt. However, a rising interest rate environment is not necessarily harmful to our financial results. Since 2002, our EBITDA and Operating income are correlated to floating interest rates (as measured by 3-month LIBOR). As such, our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates, and floating-rate debt serves as a natural hedge against weaker operating results.

At December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt including current maturities was $

2,204.9

million compared to a book value of $

1,980.5

million. The estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt. The fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date. The effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by $

111.4

million.

We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high-quality bonds and the expected return on plan assets. The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Annual Report.

ITEM 8

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for

each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 201


. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to

express an opinion on the financial statement

s b

ased on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies as of December 31, 201


and 201


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of

the three years in the period ended December 31, 201


in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Vulcan Materials Company (the "Company," "Vulcan," "we," "our"), a New Jersey corporation, is the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product — aggregates — is used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. We serve markets in

twenty

states, Washington D.C., and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states in metropolitan markets in the United States that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These

three

demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates. While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Southwestern and Western markets.

Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as described in Note 2, the operating results of the Chemicals business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vulcan Materials Company and all our majority or

wholly-owned subsidiary companies. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of these financial statements are related to goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, reclamation costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental compliance, claims and litigation including self-insurance, and income taxes.

BUSINESS COMBINA

TIO

NS

We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.

RESTRU

CTURING CHARGES

Costs associated with restructuring our operations include severance and related charges to eliminate a specified number of employee positions, costs to relocate employees, contract cancellation costs and charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations. Relocation, contract cancellation costs and charges to vacate facilities are recognized in the period the liability is incurred. Severance charges for employees, who are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, generally more than 60 days, are recognized ratably over the retention period; otherwise, the full severance charge is recognized on the date a detailed restructuring plan has been authorized by management and communicated to employees.

In 2014, we announced changes to our executive management team, and a new divisional organization structure that was effective January 1, 2015. During 2015 and 2014, we incurred

$

4,988,000

and

$1,308,000

, respectively, of costs related to these initiatives. We do not expect to incur any future material charges related to these initiatives.

Part I

I


During 2013, we incurred

$1,509,000

of severance costs related to the implementation of a 2012 profit enhancement plan.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our extending credit to trade customers for the purchase of our products. The terms generally provide for payment within 30 days of being invoiced. On occasion, when necessary to conform to regional industry practices, we sell product under extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or unsecured short-term notes; or, on occasion, notes with durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing accounts receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from short-term transactions (less than one year) other than the sale of our products, such as interest receivable; insurance claims; freight claims; tax refund claims; bid deposits or

rents receivable. Receivables are aged and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense are recorded. Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 2015

—

$

1,450,000

,


—

$2,031,000

and


—

$602,000

. Write-offs of accounts receivables for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 2015

—

$

1,483,000

,


—

$2,561,000

and


—

$1,946,000

.

INVENTORIES

Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories because it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials, direct labor and production overhead. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. Substantially all operating supplies inventory is carried at average cost. For additional information regarding our inventories see Note 3.

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT

Property, plant & equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. The cost of properties held under capital leases, if any, is equal to the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease.

Capitalized software costs of

$

7,003,000

and

$8,753,000

are reflected in net property, plant & equipment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized software costs for the years ended December 31 as follows: 2015 —

$

1,482,000

, 2014 —

$921,000

and 2013 —

$1,695,000

. For

additional information regarding our property, plant & equipment see Note 4.

REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments that add materially to the utility or useful lives of property, plant & equipment are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance activities, related primarily to periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to the next overhaul.

Part I

I


DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION, ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated service lives of the various classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (


to


years), buildings (


to


years) and land improvements (


to


years). Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis beginning when the software project is substantially complete.

Cost depletion on depletable land is computed by the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units.

Accretion reflects the period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset retirement obligations. It is computed using the same credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to initially measure the liability at fair value.

Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful lives.

Amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets.

A significant portion of our intangible assets is contractual rights in place associated with zoning, permitting and other rights to access and extract aggregates reserves. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31 is outlined below:

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We periodically use derivative instruments to manage our

mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt and to manage our

exposure

to cu

rrency exchange risk or price fluctuations on commodity energy sources consistent with our risk management policies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments are presented in Note 5.

Part I

I


FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2:

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data

Level 3:

Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement

Our assets at December 31 subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below:

We have established

two

Rabbi Trusts for the purpose of providing a level of security for the employee nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans and for the directors' nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds and equity securities for which quoted prices in active markets are available. Level 2 investments are stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying investments in those funds (short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit).

Net gains (losses) of the Rabbi Trust investments were

$

(1,517,000)

,

$1,169,000

and

$4,398,000

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The portions of the net gains (losses) related to investments still held by the Rabbi Trusts at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were

$

(1,769,000)

,

$(1,049,000)

and

$4,234,000

, respectively.

The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, short-term debt, trade payables and accruals, and all other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

There were no assets or liabilities subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis in 2013. Assets that were subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis in 2015 and 2014 are summarized below:

We recorded

$

5,190,000

and

$3,095,000

of losses on impairment of long-lived assets (reported within other operating expenses, net in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, reducing the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair values of

$0

and

$2,172,000

. Fair value was estimated using a market approach (observed transactions involving comparable assets in similar locations).

GOODWILL AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2015, goodwill totaled

$

3,094,824,000

,

the same as

at December 31, 2014. Goodwill represents


%

of total assets at December 31, 2015 compared to

38%

as of December 31, 2014.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium. Within these

four

operating segments, we have identified


reporting units (of which


carry goodwill) based primarily on geographic location. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.

The first step of the quantitative impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step of the quantitative impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

The results of the first step of the annual impairment tests performed as of November 1, 201


, 2014 and 2013 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values. Accordingly, there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 201


, 2014 or 2013.

We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies). Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

For additional information regarding goodwill see Note 18.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

We test long-lived assets for impairment at the

lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at

a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g., asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.

As of December 31, 2015, net property, plant & equipment represents


%

of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents


%

of total assets. During 2015, we recorded a

$

5,190,000

loss on impairment of long-lived assets related to exiting a lease

for an aggregates site

. During 2014, we recorded a

$3,095,000

loss on impairment of long-lived assets related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area (see Note 19). We recorded

no

asset impairments during 2013.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets see Notes 4 and 18.

TOTAL REVENUES AND REVENUE RECOGNITION

Total revenues include sales of product to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers. Freight and delivery generally represents pass-through transportation we incur (including our administrative costs) and pay to third-party carriers to deliver our products to customers. The cost related to freight and delivery is included in cost of revenues.

Revenue is recognized at the time the selling price is fixed, the product's title is transferred to the buyer and collectibility of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured (typically occurs when finished products are shipped to the customer).

SALES TAXES

Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded as liabilities (within other accrued liabilities) until remitted to taxing authorities and therefore, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

DEFERRED REVENUE

In 2013 and 2012, we sold a percentage interest in future production structured as volumetric production payments (VPPs).

The VPPs:

§

relate to

eight

quarries in Georgia and South Carolina

§

provide the purchaser solely with a nonoperating percentage interest in the subject quarries’ future production from aggregates reserves

§

are both time and volume limited

§

contain no minimum annual or cumulative production or sales volume, nor minimum sales price, guarantees

Our consolidated total revenues excludes the sales of aggregates owned by the VPP purchaser.

We received net cash proceeds from the sale of the VPPs of

$153,282,000

and

$73,644,000

for the 2013 and 2012 transactions, respectively. These proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and are amortized to revenue on a unit-of-sales basis over the terms of the VPPs (expected to be approximately


years, limited by volume rather than time).

Reconciliation of the deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent) is as follows:

STRIPPING COSTS

In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits are referred to as stripping costs.

Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered costs of extracted minerals under our inventory costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. The production stage is deemed to begin when the activities, including removal of overburden and waste material that may contain incidental saleable material, required to access the saleable product are complete. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced were

$

50,409,000

in 2015,

$44,896,000

in 2014 and

$41,716,000

in 2013.

Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are excluded from our inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized and reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are expensed over the productive life of the mine using the unit-of-production method. Pre-production stripping costs included in other noncurrent assets were

$

61,369,000

as of December 31, 2015 and

$44,035,000

as of December 31, 2014.

This year-over-year increase resulted

primarily

from

the removal of overburden

at a greenfield site in California.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We account for share-based compensation awards using fair-value-based measurement methods. These result in the recognition of compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards based on their fair value as of the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period.

We receive an income tax deduction for share-based compensation equal to the excess of the market value of our common stock on the date of exercise or issuance over the exercise price. Tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows. The

$3,464,000

, and

$161,000

excess tax benefits classified as financing cash inflows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relate to the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under long-term incentive plans.

A summary of the estimated future compensation cost (unrecognized compensation expense) as of December 31, 2015 related to share-based awards granted to employees under our long-term incentive plans is presented below:

RECLAMATION COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost (

including a reasonable profit margin)

for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation

tasks. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

The carrying value of these obligations was

$

226,594,000

as of December 31, 2015 and

$226,565,000

as of December 31, 2014. For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations) see Note 17.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The primary assumptions are as follows:

§

Discount Rate

— The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of projected benefit payments

§

Expected Return on Plan Assets

— The expected future return on plan assets reduces the recorded net benefit costs

§

Rate of Compensation Increase

— Annual pay increases after 2015 will not increase our pension plan obligations as a result of a 2013 plan amendment

§

Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Healthcare Benefits

— Increases in the per capita cost after 2015 will not increase our postretirement medical benefits obligation as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level

Part I

I


Accounting standards provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and asset performance. The differences between actual results and expected or estimated results are recognized in full in

other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in a systematic

manner over the average remaining service period

of participants for our active plans or the average remaining lifetime of participants for our inactive plans.

For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see Note 10.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our environmental compliance costs are undiscounted and include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. We accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study.

When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2015, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was

$

3,154,000

. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers.

Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates

and

key assumptions

in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. H

owever,

a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see Note 8.

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to

$2,000,000

per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to

$3,000,000

per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. The following table outlines our self-insurance program at December 31:

Part I

I


Estimated payments (undiscounted) under our self-insurance program for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

INCOME TAXES

We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities (which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay) based on the differences between the financial statement’s carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns.

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9.

U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. At least annually, we evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore.

We recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than

50%

likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.

The years open to tax examinations vary by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate.

We consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled,” settlement of an examination, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Upon resolution of a tax position, any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

Our largest permanent item in computing both our taxable income and effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

We report comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Equity. Comprehensive income comprises two subsets: net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI includes fair value adjustments to cash flow hedges, actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs related to pension and postretirement benefit plans.

For additional information regarding comprehensive income see Note 14.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)

Earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution (diluted EPS), as set forth below:

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our earnings per share calculations. Antidilutive common stock equivalents are not included in our earnings per share

calculations.

The number of antidilutive common stock equivalents for which the exercise price exceeds the weighted-average market price for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform with the 2015 presentation. During 2015, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” resulting in adjustments to our prior financial statements as noted in the caption (Debt Issuance Costs) below.

ecember 31, 2015, we early adopted ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes” on a prospective basis (i.e., prior balance sheets were not adjusted). Under ASU 2015-17, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent in our balance sheet. Under prior guidance, deferred tax assets and liabilities were separately presented as current and noncurrent in our balance sheet.

See Note 9 for additional detail.

DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  As of and for the interim period ended June 30, 2015, we early adopted ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.” Under ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs related to a note are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the related debt liability rather than as a prepaid expense (the amortization of such costs continues to be reported as interest expense). However, this ASU did not address the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance cost

s

incurred before a debt liability is recognized o

r a

ssociated with revolving debt arrangements, such as our line of credit. Accordingly, we elected an accounting policy to present

all

debt issuance costs as a deduction from the total debt liability. This ASU and related election are retrospectively applied to the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. As a result of the retrospective application of this change in accounting principle, we adjusted our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for the prior period presented. Debt issuance costs of

$20,805,000

previously reported as other noncurrent assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 were reclassified as a deduction from the principal amount of the total debt liability.

SHARE-BASED AWARDS  As of and for the interim period ended March 31, 2015, we adopted ASU 2014-12, “Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period.” This ASU clarified the proper method of accounting for share-based awards when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service perio

d

.

U

nder ASU 2014-12, a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after completion of the service period should be treated as a performance condition and, as a result, should not be included in the estimation of the grant-date fair value. Rather, an entity should recognize compensation cost for the award when it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved.

Historically

, we accounted for share-based awards with these types of performance targets

consistent with the clarification

in

A

SU 2014-12. Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS REPORTING  As of and for the interim period ended March 31, 2015, we adopted ASU 2014-08, “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.” This ASU changed the definition of and expanded the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations. Under the new definition, discontinued operations reporting is limited to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. The expanded disclosures for discontinued operations are meant to provide users of financial statements with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of discontinued operations. Additionally, this ASU requires an entity to disclose the pretax profit or loss of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION

CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  In January 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which amends

certain aspects of

current guidance on the

recognition, measurement and disclosure

of financial instruments.

Among other changes, this ASU requires most equity investments be measured at fair value. Additionally, the ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for instruments not recognized at fair value in our financial statements.

This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS  In September 2015, the F

ASB

issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,” which requires an acquirer to recognize measurement-period adjustments to provisional amounts in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined. Previously, measurement-period adjustments were retrospectively applied. As an alternative to restating the prior periods for the measurement-period adjustments, the ASU requires acquirers to present separately on the face of the earnings statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustments to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This ASU is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2016. While we are still evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-16, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

INVENTORY MEASUREMENT  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market principle to the lower of cost and net realizable value principle. The guidance applies to inventories that are measured using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost method, but does not apply to inventories that are measured by using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory method. We use the LIFO method for approximately


%

of our inventory (based on the December 31, 2015 balances); therefore, this ASU will not apply to the majority of our inventory. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2017. While we are still evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-11, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE INVESTMENTS  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, “Disclosures for Investment in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent),” which removes the requirement to categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy when their fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. This ASU also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures would be limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. This ASU is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2016. While we are still evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-07, it will not impact our consolidated financial statements as it only affects disclosure. Thus, it will impact the notes to our consolidated financial statements, specifically, our pension plan fair value disclosures.

CONSOLIDATION  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,” which amends existing consolidation guidance for reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

GOING CONCERN  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern (meet its obligations as they become due) within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, certain disclosures are required. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the annual period ending December 31, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This ASU provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues and expands required revenue recognition disclosures. This ASU (as later amended) is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation. In addition to the initial cash proceeds, Basic Chemicals was required to make payments under

two

earn-out agreements. During 2013, we received the final payment under the 5CP earn-out of

$13,031,000

. We were liable for a cash transaction bonus payable annually to certain former key Chemicals employees based on the prior year’s earn-out results. Payments for the transaction bonus were

$1,303,000

in 2013.

The financial results of the Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. There were no revenues from discontinued operations for the years presented. Results from discontinued operations are as follows:

The 2015, 2014 and 2013 pretax losses from discontinued operations of

$

19,326,000

,

$3,683,000

and

$5,744,000

, respectively, include charges related to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business. The current year’s increased loss resulted primarily from charges associated with the Lower Passaic and Texas Brine matters as further discussed in Note 12.

NOTE 3: INVENTORIES

Inventories at December 31 are as follows:


Includes inventories encumbered by the purchaser's percentage

of vo

lumetric production payment

s

(see Note 1, Deferred Revenue), as follows: December 31, 2015 —

$

4,452

thousand and December 31, 2014 —

$

4,792

thousand.

In addition to the inventory balances presented above, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we have

$

14,995,000

and

$17,449,000

, respectively, of inventory classified as long-term assets (other noncurrent assets) as we do not expect to sell the inventory within one year of their respective balance sheet dates. Inventories valued under the LIFO method total

$

242,147,000

at December 31, 2015 and

$232,371,000

at December 31, 2014. During 201


, 2014 and 2013, inventory reductions resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared to current-year costs. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2015 results was to decrease cost of revenues by

$

3,284,000

and increase net earnings by

$

2,010,000

. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2014 results was to decrease

c

ost of revenues by

$2,686,000

and increase net earnings by

$1,650,000

. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2013 results was to decrease cost of revenues by

$1,310,000

and increase net earnings by

$802,000

.

Estimated current cost exceeded LIFO cost at December 31, 2015 and 2014 by

$

169,257,000

and

$181,633,000

, respectively. We use the LIFO method of valuation for most of our inventories as it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. We provide supplemental income disclosures to facilitate comparisons with companies not on LIFO. The supplemental income calculation is derived by tax-effecting the change in the LIFO reserve for the periods presented. If all inventories valued at LIFO cost had been valued under the methods (substantially average cost) used prior to the adoption of the LIFO method, the approximate effect on net earnings would have been

a

de

crease of

$

(7,614,000)

in 2015,

an increase of

$19,108,000

in 2014 and an i

ncrease of

$20,812,000

in 2013.

NOTE 4: PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT

Balances of major classes of assets and allowances for depreciation, depletion and amortization at December 31 are as follows:


Includes depletable land, as follows: December 31, 2015 —

$

1,296,211

thousand and December 31, 2014 —

$1,287,225

thousand.

Capitalized interest costs with respect to qualifying construction projects and total interest costs incurred before recognition of the capitalized amount for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

NOTE 5: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to balance the cost and risk of such expenses. We do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.

The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationship. The interest rate swap agreements described below were designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap fair value hedges are recorded as interest expense consistent with the change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged.

Part I

I


CASH FLOW HEDGES

During 2007, we entered into

fifteen

forward starting interest rate locks on

$1,500,000,000

of future debt issuances in order to hedge the risk of higher interest rates. Upon the 2007 and 2008 issuances of the related fixed-rate debt, underlying interest rates were lower than the rate locks and we terminated and settled these forward starting locks for cash pay

ments of

$89,777,000

. This amount was booked to AOCI and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.

This amortization was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 as follows:

The loss reclassified from AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred loss in the amount of

$

7,208,000

and

$3,762,000

, respectively, referable to the debt purchases as described in Note 6.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2016, we estimate that

$

2,008,000

of the pretax loss in AOCI will be reclassified to earnings.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

In June 2011, we issued

$500,000,000

of

6.50%

fixed-rate notes due in 2016 to refinance near term floating-rate debt. Concurrently, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of

$500,000,000

to reestablish the pre-refinancing mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month London Interbank Offered

Rate (LIBOR) plus a

spread of

4.05%

and received a fixed interest rate of

6.50%

. Additionally, in June 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our

$150,000,000

of

10.125%

fixed-rate notes due in 2015. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of

8.03%

and received a fixed interest rate of

10.125%

. In August 2011, we terminated and settled these interest rate swap agreements for

$25,382,000

of cash proceeds. The

$23,387,000

gain component of the settlement (cash proceeds less

$1,995,000

of accrued interest) was added to the carrying value of the related debt and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the related debt using the effective interest method.

This deferred gain amortization was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 as follows:

The amortized deferred gain for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred gain in the amount of

$

1,642,000

and

$8,032,000

, respectively, referable to the debt purchases as described in Note 6. The deferred gain was fully amortized in December 2015, concurrent with the retirement of the

10.125%

notes due 2015.

NOTE 6: DEBT

Debt at December 31 is detailed as follows:


Borrowings on the bank line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay within twelve months and as long-term debt otherwise.


Non-publicly traded debt.


The effective interest rate is the spread over LIBOR as of the balance sheet dates.


The unamortized deferred gain was realized upon the August 2011 settlement of interest rate swaps as discussed in Note 5.


The debt balances as of December 31, 2014 have been adjusted to reflect our early adoption of ASU 2015-03 and related election as discussed in Note 1 under the caption New Accounting Standards.


Face value of our debt is equal to total debt

plus

unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, and unamortized deferred interest rate swap gain, as follows

: December 31, 2015

—

$2,004,198

thousand and December 31, 2014

—

$2,004,459

thousand

.

Our total debt is presented in the table above net of unamortized discounts from par, unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized deferred interest rate swap settlement gains. Discounts, deferred debt issuance costs and deferred swap settlement gains are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective notes.

The estimated fair value of our debt presented in the table above was determined by: (1) averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and (2) assuming par value for the remainder of the debt. The fair value estimates for the publicly traded notes were based on Level 2 information (as defined in Note 1, caption Fair Value Measurements) as of their respective balance sheet dates.

LINE OF CREDIT

In

June 2015, we cancelled our secured

$500,000,000

line of credit and entered into a

n

unsecured

$750,000,000

line of credit (incurring

$2,589,000

of transaction fees

).

Th

e l

ine of credit

agreement

expires in June


and

contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for an unsecured facility. The primary negative covenant limits our ability to incur secured deb

t. The financial covenants are:

(1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA of

3.5

:1 through September 2016 and

3.25

:1 thereafter

,

and (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net cash interest expense of

3.0

:1.

As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants.

Borrowings on our line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay within twelve months and as long-term debt if we have the intent and ability to extend repayment beyond twelve months. Borrowings bear interest, at our option, at either LIBOR plus a credit margin ranging from

1.00%

to

2.00%

, or SunTrust Bank’s base rate (generally, its prime rate) plus a credit margin ranging from

0.00%

to

1.00%

. The credit margin for both LIBOR and base rate borrowings is determined by either our ratio of debt to EBITDA or our credit ratings, based on the metric that produces the lower credit margin. Standby letters of credit, which are issued under the line of credit and reduce availability, are charged a fee equal to the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings plus

0.175%

. We also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the line of credit that ranges from

0.10%

to

0.35%

based on either our ratio of debt to EBITDA or our credit ratings, based on the metric that produces the lower fee. As of December 31, 2015, the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings was

1.75%

, the credit margin for base rate borrowings was

0.75%

, and the commitment fee for the unused amount was

0.25%

.

As of December 31, 2015, our available borrowing capacity was

$476,136,000

. Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows:

§

$235,000,000

was borrowed

§

$38,864,000

was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit

TERM DEBT

All of our term debt is unsecured. All such debt, other than the

$498,000

of other notes, is governed by two essentially identical indentures that contain customary investment-grade type covenants. The primary covenant in both indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the term debt covenants.

In August 2015, we repaid our

$14,000,000

industrial revenue bond due


via borrowing on our line of credit. The repayment did not incur any prepayment penalties. Additionally, in December 2015, we repaid our

$150,000,000

10.125%

notes due


via borrowing on our line of credit.

In March 2015, we issued

$400,000,000

of

4.50%

senior notes due


. Proceeds (net of underwriter fees and other transaction costs) of

$395,207,000

were partially used to fund the March 30, 2015 purchase, via tender offer, of

$127,303,000

principal amount (

32%

) of the

7.00%

notes due


. The March 2015 debt purchase cost

$145,899,000

, including an

$18,140,000

premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction costs of

$456,000

. The premium primarily reflects the trading price of the notes relative to par prior to the tender offer commencement. Additionally, we recognized

$3,138,000

of net noncash expense associated with the acceleration of a proportional amount of unamortized discounts, deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred interest rate derivative settlement gains and losses. The combined first quarter charge of

$21,734,000

is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The remaining net proceeds from the March 2015 debt issuance, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our line of credit, funded: (1) the April 2015 redemption of

$218,633,000

principal amount (

100%

) of the

6.40%

notes due


, (2) the April 2015 redemption of

$125,001,000

principal amount (

100%

) of the

6.50%

notes due


and (3) the April 2015 purchase, via the tender offer commenced in March 2015 of

$185,000

principal amount (less than

1%

) of the

7.00%

notes due 2018. The April 2015 debt purchases cost

$385,024,000

, including a

$41,153,000

premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction costs of

$52,000

. The premium primarily reflects the make-whole value of the 2016 notes and the 2017 notes. Additionally, we recognized

$4,136,000

of net noncash expense associated with the acceleration of unamortized discounts, deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred interest rate derivative settlement gains and losses. The combined second quarter charge of

$45,341,000

is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In March 2014, we purchased

$506,366,000

principal amount of debt through a tender offer as follows:

$374,999,000

of

6.50%

notes due in 2016 and

$131,367,000

of

6.40%

notes due in 2017. This debt purchase was funded by the sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area as described in Note


. The March 2014 debt purchases cost

$579,659,000

, including a

$71,829,000

premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction costs of

$1,464,000

. The premium primarily reflects the trading price of the notes relative to par prior to the tender offer commencement. Additionally, we recognized a net noncash benefit of

$344,000

associated with the acceleration of a proportional amount of unamortized discounts, deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred interest rate derivative settlement gains and losses. The combined charge of

$72,949,000

is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for

the

year ended December 31, 2014.

DEBT PAYMENTS

As described above, during the first and second quarters of 2015, we purchased/redeemed

$471,122,000

principal amount of debt using the proceeds from the March 2015 debt issuance, cash on hand and borrowings on our line of credit. Additionally in 2015, we borrowed on our line of credit during August to repay our $14,000,000 industrial revenue bond due 2022 and during December to repay our $150,000,000 10.125% notes due 2015.

There were no material scheduled debt payments during 2014. However, as described above, we purchased $506,366,000 principal amount of debt through a tender offer in the first quarter of 2014.

The total scheduled (principal and interest) debt payments, excluding draws, if any, on the line of credit, for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2015 are as follows:

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT

We provide, in the normal course of business, certain third-party beneficiaries standby letters of credit to support our obligations to pay or perform according to the requirements of an underlying agreement. Such letters of credit typically have an initial term of

one

year, typically renew automatically, and can only be modified or cancelled with the approval of the beneficiary. All of our standby letters of credit are issued by banks that participate in our $750,000,000 line of credit, and reduce the borrowing capacity thereunder. Our standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2015 are summarized by purpose in the table below:

NOTE 7: OPERATING LEASES

Rental expense from continuing operations under nonmineral operating leases for the years ended December 31, exclusive of rental payments made under leases of one month or less, is summarized as follows:

Future minimum operating lease payments under all leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year, exclusive of mineral leases

(see Note 12)

, as of December 31, 201


are payable as follows:

Lease agreements frequently include renewal options and require that we pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense. Options to purchase are also included in some lease agreements.

NOTE 8: ACCRUED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 include accrued environmental remediation costs (measured on an undiscounted basis) as follows:

The long-term portion of the accruals noted above is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to

$12,569,000

at December 31, 2015 and

$6,736,000

at December 31, 2014. The short-term portion of these accruals is included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The accrued environmental remediation costs in continuing operations relate primarily to the former Florida Rock, Tarmac, and CalMat facilities acquired in 2007, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The current increase primarily relates to environmental costs incurred at the Hewitt Landfill.

The balances noted above for Chemicals relate to retained environmental remediation costs from the 2003 sale of the Performance Chemicals business and the 2005 sale of the Chloralkali business.

The increase in these retained liabilities primarily relates to the Lower Passaic River Superfund site.

xes on the balance sheet result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net deferred income tax liability at December 31 are as follows:

The above amounts are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 as follows:


As discussed in Note 1, we early adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis as of December 31, 2015. Thus, all deferred income taxes

as of December 31,

2015 are classified as noncurrent

resulting in a

$44,464

thousand decrease in current assets

with a corresponding decrease in noncurrent liabilities.

As noted above, we have state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of $61,658,000 of which

$58,921,000

relates to Alabama.

The Alabama net operating loss carryforward, if not utilized, would expire in years 2022 – 2029.

Prior to 2015, this Alabama deferred tax asset carried a full valuation allowance. During 2015, we restructured our legal entities which resulted in a partial release of the valuation allowance in the amount of

$4,655,000

.

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

As of December 31, 2015, income tax receivables of

$4,138,000

are included in accounts and notes receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. These receivables relate to prior year state overpayments that we have requested to be refunded. There were similar receivables of

$1,040,000

as of December 31, 2014.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is discussed in our accounting policy for income taxes (see Note 1, caption Income Taxes). Changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Interest and penalties recognized as income tax expense (benefit) were

$138,000

in 2015,

$(1,067,000)

in 2014 and

$(788,000)

in 2013. The balance of accrued interest and penalties included in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 was

$1,103,000

in 2015,

$965,000

in 2014 and

$2,032,000

in 2013.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31 in the table above include

$7,614,000

in 2015,

$6,282,000

in 2014 and

$7,910,000

in 2013 that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

We are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. We anticipate no single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date.

We file income tax returns in U.S. federal, various state and foreign jurisdictions. Generally, we are not subject to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years prior to 2012.

As of December 31, 2015, we have

$75,938,000

of accumulated undistributed earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries. We consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, have not recorde

d i

ncome taxes on these earnings. If we were to distribute these earnings in the form of dividends, the distribution would result in U.S. income taxes of

$26,578,000.

NOTE 10: BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor

three

funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees hired prior to July 2007, other than those covered by union-administered plans. Normal retirement age is


, but the plans contain provisions for earlier retirement. Benefits for the Salaried Plan and the Chemicals Hourly Plan are generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the Construction Materials Hourly Plan provides benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of service. In addition to these qualified plans, we sponsor

three

unfunded, nonqualified pension plans. The projected benefit obligation presented in the table below includes

$89,652,000

and

$101,230,000

, respectively, related to these unfunded, nonqualified pension plans for 2015 and 2014.

Effective July 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans to no longer accept new participants. In December 2013, we amended our defined benefit pension plans so that future service accruals for salaried pension participants ceased effective December 31, 2013. This change included a special transition provision which will allow covered compensation through December 31, 2015 to be considered in the participants’ benefit calculations. The amendment resulted in a curtailment and remeasurement of the salaried and nonqualified pension plans in May 2013 that reduced our 2013 pension expense by approximately

$7,600,000

(net of the one-time curtailment loss) of which

$800,000

was related to discontinued operations.

The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the plans and their reconciliation with the related amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements at December 31:

Part I

I


The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) exceeded plan assets for all of our defined benefit plans at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The ABO for all of our defined benefit pension plans totaled

$987,724,000

(unfunded, nonqualified plans of

$89,652,000)

at December 31, 2015 and

$1,061,816,000

(unfunded, nonqualified plans of

$95,154,000

) at December 31, 2014.

The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost, amounts recognized in other comprehensive income and weighted-average assumptions of the plans at December 31:

The settlement charge noted above relates to a lump sum payment to a former employee from the nonqualified plan. This charge is reflected within both cost of revenues and selling, administrative and general expenses in our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior servic

hat will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension benefit cost

(credit)

during 2016 are

$6,067,000

and

$(43,000),

r

espectively.

Assumptions regarding our expected return on plan assets are based primarily on judgments made by us and the Finance Committee of our Board. These judgments take into account the expectations of our pension plan consultants and actuaries and our investment advisors. We base our expected return on long-term investment expectations. The expected return on plan assets used to determine 2015 pension benefit cost was

7.50%

.

We establish our pension investment policy by evaluating asset/liability studies periodically performed by our consultants. These studies estimate trade-offs between expected returns on our investments and the variability in anticipated cash contributions to fund our pension liabilities. Our policy balances the variability in potential pension fund contributions to expected returns on our investments.

Our current strategy for implementing this policy is to invest in publicly traded equities and in publicly traded debt and private, nonliquid opportunities, such as venture capital, commodities, buyout funds and mezzanine debt. The target allocation ranges for plan assets are as follows: equity securities —

50%

to

77%

; debt securities —

15%

to

27%

; specialty investments —

0%

to

20%

; commodities —

0%

to

6%;

and cash reserves —

0%

to

5%

. Equity securities include domestic investments and foreign equities in the Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Emerging Market Indices. Debt securities primarily include domestic debt instruments, while specialty investments include investments in venture capital, buyout funds, mezzanine debt, private partnerships and an interest in a commodity index fund.

The fair values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 by asset category are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2015


See Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements for a description of the fair value hierarchy.

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2014


See Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements for a description of the fair value hierarchy.

Part I

I


At each measurement date, we estimate the fair value of our pension assets using various valuation techniques. We utilize, to the extent available, quoted market prices in active markets or observable market inputs in estimating the fair value of our pension assets. When quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not available, we utilize valuation techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of our pension assets. The following describes the types of investments included in each asset category listed in the tables above and the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair values as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

The debt securities category consists of bonds issued by U.S. federal, state and local governments, corporate debt securities, fixed income obligations issued by foreign governments, and asset-backed securities. The fair values of U.S. government and corporate debt securities are based on current market rates and credit spreads for debt securities with similar maturities. The fair values of debt securities issued by foreign governments are based on prices obtained from broker/dealers and international indices. The fair values of asset-backed securities are priced using prepayment speed and spread inputs that are sourced from the new issue market.

Investment funds consist of exchange traded and non-exchange traded funds. The commodity funds asset category consists of a single open-end commodity mutual fund. The equity funds asset category consists of index funds for domestic equities and an actively managed fund for international equities. The short-term funds asset category consists of a collective investment trust invested in highly liquid, short-term debt securities. For investment funds publicly traded on a national securities exchange, the fair value is based on quoted market prices. For investment funds not traded on an exchange, the total fair value of the underlying securities is used to determine the net asset value for each unit of the fund held by the pension fund. The estimated fair values of the underlying securities are generally valued based on quoted market prices. For securities without quoted market prices, other observable market inputs are utilized to determine the fair value.

The venture capital and partnerships asset category consists of various limited partnership funds, mezzanine debt funds and leveraged buyout funds. The fair value of these investments has been estimated based on methods employed by the general partners, including consideration of, among other things, reference to third-party transactions, valuations of comparable companies operating within the same or similar industry, the current economic and competitive environment, creditworthiness of the corporate issuer, as well as market prices for instruments with similar maturities, terms, conditions and quality ratings. The use of different assumptions, applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value of these securities.

A reconciliation of the fair value measurements of our pension plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is presented below:

Total employer contributions for the pension plans are presented below:

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made

no

contributions to our qualified pension plans. We do not anticipate making contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2016. For our nonqualified pension plans, we made benefit payments of

$14,047,000

,

$5,488,000

and

$4,855,000

during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and expect to make payments of

$9,107,000

during 2016.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements for union-represented employees. A multiemployer plan is subject to collective bargaining for employees of two or more unrelated companies. Multiemployer plans are managed by boards of trustees on which management and labor have equal representation. However, in most cases, management is not directly represented. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans differ from single employer plans as follows:

§

assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers

§

if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers

§

if we cease to have an obligation to contribute to one or more of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability

None of the multiemployer pension plans that we participate in are individually significant. Our contributions to individual multiemployer pension funds did not exceed

5%

of the fund’s total contributions in the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Total contributions to multiemployer pension plans were

$9,800,000

in 2015,

$8,503,000

in 2014 and

$7,580,000

in 2013.

As of December 31, 2015, a total of

14%

of our domestic hourly labor force was covered by collective-bargaining agreements. Of such employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements,

40%

were covered by agreements that expire in 2016. We also employed


union employees in Mexico who are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement that will expire in 2016. None of our union employees in Mexico participate in multiemployer pension plans.

In addition to the pension plans noted above, we had one unfunded supplemental retirement plan as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The accrued costs for the supplemental retirement plan were

$1,384,000

at December 31, 2015 and

$1,421,000

at December 31, 2014.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In 2012, we amended our postretirement healthcare plan to cap our portion of the medical coverage cost at the 2015 level. Substantially all our salaried employees and, where applicable, certain of our hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying age and meet certain service requirements. Generally, Company-provided healthcare benefits terminate when covered individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach age


, whichever occurs first.

The March 2014 sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area (see Note 19) significantly reduced total expected future service of our postretirement plans resulting in a reduction in the projected benefit obligation of $2,639,000 and a one-time curtailment gain of

$3,832,000

. This gain is reflected within gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses in our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the plans and their reconciliation with the related amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements at December 31:

Contributions by participants to the postretirement benefit plans for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ASSUMPTIONS

Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

In selecting the discount rate, we consider the yield on high-quality bonds with a duration equal to the duration of plan liabilities. At December 31, 2015, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from

3.53%

to

4.68%

(December 31, 2014 ranged from

3.50%

to

4.30%)

.

Beginning in 2016, we are changing the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Historically, we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows.

We are making this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding yield curve spot rates. This change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported.

We are accounting for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, are accounting for it prospectively starting in 2016. The estimated weighted-average discount rates to measure service cost and interest cost for 2016 are

4.89%

and

3.80%

, respectively, for our pension plans and

4.05%

and

2.81%

, respectively, for our other postretirement plans. The weighted-average discount rates that we would have used for service and interest costs under our prior estimation technique were

4.54%

for the pension plans and

3.69%

for the other postretirement plans. The reductions in benefit cost for 2016 associated with this change are estimated to be

$7,200,000

and

$530,000

for our pension and other postretirement plans, respectively.

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2015, the expected return on plan assets remains at 7.50%.

Annual pay increases after 2015 will not increase our pension plan obligations as a result of a 2013 plan amendment.

Future increases in the per capital cost of healthcare benefits will not increase our postretirement medical benefits obligation as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level.

DE

FINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

We sponsor

two

defined contribution plans. Substantially all salaried and nonunion hourly employees are eligible to be covered by one of these plans. Under these plans, we match employees’ eligible contributions at established rates. Expense recognized in connection with these matching obligations totaled

NOTE 11: INCENTIVE PLANS

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Our 2006 Omnibus Long-term Incentive Plan (Plan) authorizes the granting of stock options, Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights (SOSARs) and other types of share-based awards to key salaried employees and nonemployee directors. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan is

11,900,000

.

PERFORMANCE SHARES

—

Each performance share unit is equal to and paid in one share of our common stock, but carries no voting or dividend rights. The number of units ultimately paid for performance share awards may range from

0%

to

200%

of the number of units awarded on the date of grant. Payment is based upon our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the TSR performance of the S&P 500

®

. Awards vest on December 31 of the fourth year after date of grant. Vesting is accelerated upon reaching retirement age, death, disability, or change of control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested units are forfeited upon termination for any other reason. Expense provisions referable to performance share awards amounted to

$13,159,000

in 2015,

$16,863,000

in 2014 and

$16,159,000

in 2013.

The fair value of performance shares is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes the activity for nonvested performance share units during the year ended December 31, 2015:

During 2014 and 2013, the weighted-average grant-date fair value of performance shares granted was

$63.42

and

$53.65

, respectively.

The aggregate values for distributed performance share awards are based on the closing price of our common stock as of the distribution date. The aggregate values of distributed performance shares for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

In addition to the performance shares granted above, we granted

14,000

restricted shares in February 2015 and

60,000

restricted shares in December 2013 to certain key executives. These shares cliff vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date and have a grant-date fair value of

$74.85

and

$54.35

, respectively. Expense provisions referable to restricted share awards amounted to

$982,000

in 2015,

esting is accelerated upon reaching retirement age, death, disability, or change of control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested awards are forfeited upon termination for any other

reason.

The fair value of stock options/SOSARs is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation cost for stock options/SOSARs is based on this grant-date fair value and is recognized for awards that ultimately vest. The following table presents the weighted-average fair value and the weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of grants during the years ended December 31:

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity period approximating the SOSARs expected term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts adjusted for current expectations of future payouts. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility and expectations about future volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the SOSARs expected term. The expected term is based on historical experience and expectations about future exercises and represents the period of time that SOSARs granted are expected to be outstanding.

A summary of our stock option/SOSAR activity as of December 31, 2015 and changes during the year are presented below:

The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between our stock price on the last trading day of 2015 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options/SOSARs) that would have been received by the option holders had all options/SOSARs been exercised on December 31, 2015. These values change based on the fair market value of our common stock. The aggregate intrinsic values of options/SOSARs exercised for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.

We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as potential obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While ultimate resolution and financial liability is uncertain at a number of the sites, in our opinion based on information currently available, the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to these sites will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for that period. Amounts accrued for environmental matters are presented in Note 8.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine with precision the outcome, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.

In addition to these lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, certain other material legal proceedings are specifically described below.

§

Lower Passaic River Study Area (Superfund Site)

— The Lower Passaic River Study Area is part of the Diamond Shamrock Superfund Site in New Jersey. Vulcan and approximately


other companies are parties (collectively the “Cooperating Parties Group”) to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (draft RI/FS) of the lower


miles of the Passaic River (River).

On

April 11, 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) that calls for a bank-to-bank dredging remedy for the lower 8 miles of the River. The EPA estimates that the cost of implementing this proposal is approximately

$950

million to

$1.73

billion. The period for public comment on the proposed FFS is closed and it is anticipated that the EPA will issue its final record of decision in the first half of 2016. The Cooperating Parties Group draft RI/FS estimates the preferred re

\

medial action presented therein to cost in the range of approximately

$475

million to

$725

million (including

$93

million in operations and maintenance costs for a


-year period).

T

he AOC does not obligate us to fund or perform the remedial action contemplated by either the draft RI/FS or the FFS. Vulcan formerly owned a chemicals operation near River Mile 0.1, which was sold in 1974. The Company has found no evidence that its former chemicals operation contributed any of the primary contaminants of concern to the River.

Neither the ultimate remedial approach, nor the parties who will participate in funding the remediation and their respective allocations, have been determined. However, we

have estimated the cost to be incurred by us under

the remedial approach most likely to be prescribed by the EPA in

their final record of decision

an

d recorded an immaterial loss for this matter in 2015.

§

TEXAS BRINE MATTER — During the operation of its former Chemicals Division, Vulcan was the lessee to a salt lease from 1976 – 2005 in an underground salt dome formation in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. The Texas Brine Company (Texas Brine) operated this salt mine for the account of Vulcan. Vulcan sold its Chemicals Division in 2005 and assigned the lease to the purchaser, and Vulcan has had no association with the leased premises or Texas Brine since that time. In August 2012, a sinkhole developed near the salt dome and numerous lawsuits were filed in state court in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Other lawsuits, including class action litigation, were also filed in August 2012 in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans.

There are numerous defendants to the litigation in state and federal court. Vulcan was first brought into the litigation as a third-party defendant in August 2013 by Texas Brine. Vulcan has since been added as a direct and third-party defendant by other parties, including a direct claim by the state of Louisiana. The damages alleged in the litigation range from individual plaintiffs’ claims for property damage, to the state of Louisiana’s claim for response costs, to claims for physical damages to oil pipelines, to business interruption claims. In addition to the plaintiffs’ claims, Vulcan has also been sued for contractual indemnity and comparative fault by both Texas Brine and Occidental Chemical Co. (Occidental). The total amount of damages claimed is in excess of

$500

million. It is alleged that the sinkhole was caused, in whole or in part, by Vulcan’s negligent actions or failure to act. It is also alleged that Vulcan breached the salt lease, as well as an operating agreement and a drilling agreement with Texas Brine; and that Vulcan is strictly liable for certain property damages in its capacity as a former assignee of the salt lease; and that Vulcan violated certain covenants and conditions in the agreement under which it sold its Chemicals Division in 2005. Vulcan has made claims for contractual indemnity, comparative fault, and breach of contract against Texas Brine, as well as claims for contractual indemnity and comparative fault against Occidental. Discovery is ongoing and the first trial date in any of these cases has been set for March 2017. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability pertaining to this matter.

§

HEWITT LANDFILL MATTER — On September 8, 2015, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) issued a Cleanup and Abatement Order (CAO) directing Vulcan to assess, monitor, cleanup and abate wastes that have been discharged to soil, soil vapor, and/or groundwater at

the

former Hewitt Landfill in Los Angeles. The CAO follows a 2014 Investigative Order from RWQCB that sought data and a technical evaluation regarding the Hewitt Landfill, and a subsequent amendment to the Investigative Order requiring Vulcan to provide groundwater monitoring results to RWQCB and to create and implement a work plan for further investigation of the Hewitt Landfill. Vulcan is engaged in performing site investigation wor

k t

o develop an interim-remedial action plan due in the second quarter of 2016 as required by the CAO. At this time, we are unable to estimate the cost of the interim-remedial action plan but have fully accrued the costs of the site investigation work.

Vulcan is also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and other stakeholders regarding the potential contribution of the Hewitt Landfill to groundwater contamination in the San Fernando Valley. We are gathering and analyzing data and developing technical information to determine the extent of possible contribution by the Hewitt Landfill to the groundwater contamination in the area. This work is also intended to assist in identification of other sources of contamination. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability pertaining to this matter.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and a number of factors, including developments in ongoing discovery or adverse rulings, or the verdict of a particular jury, could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued costs. No liability was recorded for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be only reasonably possible or for which a loss could not be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in defense of lawsuits are expensed as incurred. In addition, losses on certain claims and litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a per occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described in Note 1 under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.

NOTE 15: SEGMENT REPORTING

We have

four

operating (and

reportable

) segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium.

The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel, sand, and other aggregates) and related products and services (transportation and other). During 2015, the Aggregates segment principally served markets in

twenty

states, Washington D.C. and Mexico with a full line of aggregates, and

six

additional states with railroad ballast. Customers use aggregates primarily in the construction and maintenance of highways, streets and other public works and in the construction of housing and commercial, industrial and other nonresidential facilities. Customers are served by truck, rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities and sales yards. Due to the high weight-to-value ratio of aggregates, markets generally are local in nature. Quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be available. We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the United States. Nondomestic revenues were

$

11,408,000

in 2015,

$14,699,000

in 2014 and

$12,339,000

in 2013.

The Asphalt Mix segment produces and sells asphalt mix in

four

states primarily in our southwestern and western markets.

The Concrete segment produces and sells ready-mixed concrete in

six

states, Washington D.C. and an immaterial amount in the Bahamas. In January 2015, we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California (see Note 19) for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona. In March 2014, we sold our concrete business in the Florida area (see Note 19) which in addition to ready-mixed concrete, included concrete block, precast concrete, as well as building materials purchased for resale.

The Calcium segment consists of a Florida facility that mines, produces and sells calcium products. Prior to the sale of our cement business in March 2014 (see Note 19), we produced and sold Portland and masonry cement in both bulk and bags from our Florida cement plant and imported and exported cement, clinker and slag and either resold, ground, blended, bagged or reprocessed those materials from other Florida facilities.

Aggregates comprise approximately

95%

of asphalt mix by weight and

80%

of ready-mixed concrete by weight. Our Asphalt Mix and Concrete segments are primarily supplied with their aggregates requirements from our Aggregates segment. These intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of product utilized in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Customers for our Asphalt Mix and Concrete segments are generally served locally at our production facilities or by truck. Because asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete harden rapidly, delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately


to


miles from the producing facility.

The vast majority of our activities are domestic. Long-lived assets outside the United States, which consist primarily of property, plant & equipment, were

NOTE 16: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Supplemental information referable to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is summarized below:

NOTE 17: ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets.

Recognition of a liability for an ARO is required in the period in which it is incurred at its estimated fair value. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. If the ARO

is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement.

We record all AROs for which we have legal obligations for land reclamation at estimated fair value. Essentially all these AROs relate to our underlying land parcels, including both owned properties and mineral leases. For the years ended December 31, we recognized ARO operating costs related to accretion of the liabilities and depreciation of the assets as follows:

ARO operating costs are reported in cost of revenues. AROs are reported within other noncurrent liabilities in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Reconciliations of the carrying amounts of our AROs for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

Part I

The ARO liabilities incurred during

2015 and

2014 relate primarily to acquisitions (see Note 19). ARO liabilities settled during

2015 and

2014 include

$13,117,000

reclamation required under the development agreement

will result in the restoration and development of


acres of previously

mined property suitable for commercial and retail development.

NOTE 18: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Acquired identifiable intangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) goodwill, (2) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization and (3) intangible assets with indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually. For additional information regarding our policies on impairment reviews, see Note 1 under the captions Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment, and Impairment of Long-lived Assets excluding Goodwill.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is recognized when the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. There were

no

charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 201


, 2014 and 2013.

We have four reportable segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized below:


Refer to Note 19 for additional details.

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. A decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of goodwill.

Part I

I


INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are stated at their fair value determined as of the date of acquisition. Costs incurred to renew or extend the life of existing intangible assets are capitalized. These capitalized renewal/extension costs were immaterial for the years presented. Intangible assets consist of contractual rights in place (primarily permitting and zoning rights), noncompetition agreements, favorable lease agreements, customer relationships and trade names and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired individually or otherwise obtained outside a business combination consist primarily of permitting, permitting compliance and zoning rights and are stated at their historical cost less accumulated amortization.

See Note 19 for the details of the intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions during 2015, 2014 and 2013. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As shown in Note 1 under the caption Fair Value Measurements, we incurred

$

2,8


8,000

of impairment charges related to intangible assets in 2015. There were

no

charges for impairment of intangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major intangible asset class for the years ended December 31 are summarized below:


Includes customer relationships and tradenames and trademarks.

Estimated amortization expense for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2015 is as follows:

During

2015,

the following assets were acquired

for

The 2015 acquisitions listed above are reported in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The amounts of total revenues and net earnings for these acquisitions (collectively) are included in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for year ended December 31, 2015

,

as follows:

None of the 2015 acquisitions listed above are material to our results of

operations or financial position either

individually or collectively. The fair value of consideration transferred for these acquisitions and the preliminary amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (based on their estimated fair values at their acquisition dates), are summarized below:

Estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary pending appraisals of contractual rights in place and property, plant & equipment.

The contractual rights in place noted above will be amortized against earnings (

- straight-line over


years and

$10,317,000

-

units of production over an estimated

Part I

None of the 2014 acquisitions listed above

were

material to our results of

operations or financial position either

individually or collectively. As a result of these 2014 acquisitions, we recognized

$128,286,000

of amortizable intangible assets (primarily contractual rights in place). The contractual rights in place will be amortized against earnings using the unit-of-production method over an estimated weighted-average period in excess of


years and all but

$36,921,000

will be deductible for income tax purposes over


years. The

$13,303,000

of goodwill recognized (none of which will be deductible for income tax purposes) represents the balance of deferred tax liabilities generated from carrying over the seller’s tax basis in the assets acquired.

DIVESTITURES

As noted above, in the first quarter of 2015, we exchanged twelve ready-mixed concrete operations in California (representing all of our California concrete operations) for thirteen asphalt mix plants (primarily in Arizona) resulting in a pretax gain of

$5,886,


.

In

2014, we sold:

§

First quarter — our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area for net pretax cash proceeds of

$721,359,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

$227,910,000

. We retained all of our Florida aggregates operations, our former Cement segment’s calcium operation in Brooksville, Florida and real estate associated with certain former ready-mixed concrete facilities. Under a separate supply agreement, we continue to provide aggregates to the divested concrete facilities, at market prices, for a period of


years. As a result of the continuing cash flows (generated via the supply agreement and the retained operation and assets), the disposition is not reported as discontinued operations

§

First quarter — a previously mined and subsequently reclaimed tract of land in Maryland (Aggregates segment) for net pretax cash proceeds of

$10,727,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

$168,000

§

First quarter — unimproved land in Tennessee previously containing a sales yard (Aggregates segment) for net pretax cash proceeds of

$5,820,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

$5,790,000

In 2013, we sold:

§

Third quarter — reclaimed land associated with a former site of a ready-mixed concrete facility in Virginia for net pretax cash

proceeds of $11,261,000 resulting in a pretax gain of $9,027,000

§

Third quarter — a percentage of the future production from aggregates reserves at certain owned quarries. The sale was structured as a volumetric production payment (VPP) for which we received gross cash proceeds of

$154,000,000

and incurred transaction costs of

$905,000

. The net proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized on a unit-of-sales basis to revenues over the term of the VPP

. See Note 1, caption Deferred Revenue, for the key terms of the VPP

§

Second quarter —

four

aggregates production facilities in Wisconsin for net pretax cash proceeds of

$34,743,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

$21,183,000

. We allocated

$4,521,000

of goodwill to these dispositions based on the relative fair values of the businesses disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit retained. Additionally, the dispositions of these facilities will likely result in a partial withdrawal from one of our multiemployer pension plans; therefore, we recognized a

$4,000,000

liability related to this plan

§

First quarter —

one

aggregates production facility in Wisconsin and its related replacement reserve land for net pretax cash proceeds of

$5,133,000

resulting in a pretax gain of

$2,802,000

. We allocated

$674,000

of goodwill to this disposition based on the relative fair value of the business disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit retained

PENDING DIVESTITURES

There were no pending divestitures classified as assets held for

sale as

of December 31, 2015. Conversely, the twelve ready-mixed concrete operations in California (exchanged for thirteen asphalt mix plants as noted above) sold in the first quarter of 2015 are presented in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 as assets held

for sale. The major classes of assets and liabilities of assets classified as held for sale as of December 31 are as follows:

Effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility. We strive to achieve value through our mining activities as well as incremental value through effective post-mining land management. Our land management strategy includes routinely reclaiming and selling our previously mined land. Additionally, this strategy includes developing conservation banks by preserving land as a suitable habitat for endangered or sensitive species. These conservation banks have received approval from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to offer mitigation credits for sale to third parties who may be required to compensate for the loss of habitats of endangered or sensitive species.

NOTE 20: UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The following is a summary of selected quarterly financial information (unaudited) for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:


Includes a

$227,910

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES

We maintain a system of controls

and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a - 15(e) or 15d -


5(e)), include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other management officials, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 201


. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

'S REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management's supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM – INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the "Company") as of December 31, 201


based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated

Framework (


)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the

effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective

internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding

of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201


based on the criteria

established in
