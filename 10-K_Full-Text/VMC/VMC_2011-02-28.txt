ITEM 1

BUSINESS

SUMMARY

Vulcan Materials Company is a New Jersey corporation and the
    nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates:
    primarily crushed stone, sand, and gravel. We have 319
    aggregates facilities. We also are a major producer of asphalt
    mix and ready-mixed concrete as well as a leading producer of
    cement in Florida.

STRATEGY
    FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS

§

Our reserves are strategically located throughout the United
    States in high growth areas that will require large amounts of
    aggregates to meet construction demand. Vulcan-served states are
    estimated to have 78% of the total growth in the
    U.S. population and 75% of the growth in
    U.S. household formations to 2020. Our top ten revenue
    producing states in 2010 were California, Virginia, Florida, Texas,
    Tennessee, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Alabama and South
    Carolina.

§

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally
    grown by mergers and acquisitions. In the last 20 years we
    have acquired over 276 aggregates operations, including many
    small bolt-on operations and several large acquisitions.

COMPETITORS

We operate in an industry that is very fragmented with a large
    number of small, privately-held companies. We estimate that the
    ten largest aggregates producers account for approximately 30%
    to 35% of the total U.S. aggregates production. Despite
    being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market
    share is less than 10%. Other publicly traded companies among
    the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the
    following:

§

Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH, plc

§

Heidelberg Cement AG

§

Holcim, Ltd.

§

Lafarge SA

§

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

§

MDU Resources Group, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented,
    with approximately 5,000 companies managing more than 9,000
    operations, many opportunities for consolidation exist.
    Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by entering
    new markets or enhancing their market positions by acquiring
    existing facilities.

BUSINESS
    STRATEGY

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure
    needed to expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on
    our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in all types of
    construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed
concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads,
    tunnels, bridges, railroads and airports that connect us, and to
    build the hospitals, churches, shopping centers, and factories
    that are essential to our lives and the economy. The following
    graphs illustrate the relationship of our four operating segments to
    sales.

AGGREGATES-LED VALUE
    CREATION — 2010 NET SALES

* Represents sales to external customers of our aggregates
    and our downstream products that use our aggregates.

Our business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus,

2) coast-to-coast

footprint, 3) profitable growth, and 4) effective land
    management.

1. AGGREGATES
    FOCUS

Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private
    construction projects and practically no substitutes for quality
    aggregates exist. Our focus on aggregates allows us to

§

BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES

: The location of our
    reserves is critical to our long-term success because of
    barriers to entry created in some markets by zoning and
    permitting regulations and high transportation costs. Our
    reserves are strategically located throughout the United States
    in high-growth areas that will require large amounts of
    aggregates to meet future construction demand. Aggregates
    operations have flexible production capabilities and require no
    raw material other than our owned or leased aggregates reserves.
    Our downstream businesses (asphalt mix and concrete)
    predominantly use Vulcan-produced aggregates.

§

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER

: Each
    aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a
    local market with particular geological characteristics. Every
    operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce
    saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan is the
    largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by
    production or by revenues. Our 319 aggregates facilities provide
    opportunities to standardize and procure equipment (fixed and
    mobile), parts, supplies and services in the most efficient and
    cost-effective manner possible both regionally and nationally.
    Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the
    organization and leverage our size for administrative support,
    customer service, accounts receivable and accounts payable,
    technical support and engineering.

§

GENERATE STRONG CASH EARNINGS PER TON, EVEN IN A
    RECESSION

: Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and
    our flexible production capabilities have allowed us to manage
    costs aggressively during the current recession. As a result,
    our cash earnings for each ton of aggregates sold in 2010 was
    26% higher than at the peak of demand in 2005.

Part
    I



2.

COAST-TO-COAST

FOOTPRINT

Demand for construction aggregates positively correlates with
    changes in population growth, household formation and
    employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence
    in metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly.

Source: Moody’s Analytics

Our top ten revenue-producing states are predicted to have 66%
    of the total growth in the U.S. population between now and
    2020. Vulcan-served states are predicted to have 78% of the
    total growth in the U.S. population between now and 2020.
    Therefore, we have located reserves in those markets expected to
    have the greatest growth in population. Additionally, many of
    these reserves are located in areas where zoning and permitting
    laws have made opening new quarries increasingly difficult. Our
    diversified geographic locations help insulate Vulcan from
    variations in regional weather and economies.

3. PROFITABLE
    GROWTH

Our growth is a result of acquisitions, cost management and
    investment activities.

§

STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS:

Since becoming a public company
    in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and
    acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co.,
    thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California,
    Arizona, and New Mexico and making us one of the nation’s
    leading producers of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest
    acquisition in our history. This acquisition

§

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and other
    southeastern and mid-Atlantic states

§

added an extensive ready-mixed concrete business in Florida,
    Maryland, Virginia and Washington D.C.

§

added cement manufacturing and distribution facilities in Florida

In addition to these large acquisitions, we have completed many
    smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our
    growth.

§

TIGHTLY MANAGED COSTS:

In a business where our aggregates
    sell, on average, for $10.13 per ton, we are accustomed to
    rigorous cost management throughout economic cycles. Small
    savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions. We are
    able to reduce or expand production and adjust employment levels
    to meet changing market demands without jeopardizing our ability
    to take advantage of future increased demand.

§

REINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH HIGH RETURNS:

In the next
    decade, Moody’s Analytics projects that 78% of the
    U.S. population growth will occur in Vulcan-served states.
    The close proximity of our production facilities and our
    aggregates reserves to this projected population growth creates
    many opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects
    that will add reserves, increase production capacity and improve
    costs.

Part
    I



4. EFFECTIVE LAND
    MANAGEMENT

At Vulcan we believe that effective land management is both a
    business strategy and a social responsibility and that it
    contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the
    careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning
    because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land.
    Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we
    create through our mining activities and the value we create
    through effective post-mining land management. We continue to
    expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions
    regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently
    hold and will hold in the future.

1. AGGREGATES

A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and
    our business including markets, reserves and demand cycles.

§

LOCAL MARKETS:

Aggregates have a high

weight-to-value

ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are
    used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials.
    Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along
    the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there
    are limited supplies of locally available high quality
    aggregates. We serve these markets from inland
    quarries — shipping by barge and rail — and
    from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We transport
    aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three
    Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.

§

DIVERSE MARKETS:

Large quantities of aggregates are used
    in virtually all types of public- and private-sector
    construction projects such as highways, airports, water and
    sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential
    and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as
    railroad track ballast.

§

LOCATION AND QUALITY OF RESERVES:

Vulcan currently has
    14.7 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable
    aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in
    areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in
    population, jobs and households, which require new
    infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development.
    Such growth requires aggregates for construction. Zoning and
    permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly
    difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing
    quarries or to develop new quarries. These restrictions could
    curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also could increase
    the value of our reserves at existing locations.

Part
    I



§

DEMAND CYCLES:

Long-term growth in demand for aggregates
    is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households.
    While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates
    with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed
    by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new
    historical high. In comparison to all other recent demand cycles, the current
    downturn has been unusually steep and long, making it difficult
    to predict the timing or strength of future recovery.

Highway construction is the most aggregates-intensive form of
    construction and residential construction is the least intensive
    (see table below). A dollar spent for highway construction is
    estimated to consume seven times the quantity of aggregates
    consumed by a dollar spent for residential construction. Other
    non-highway infrastructure markets like airports, sewer and
    waste disposal, or water supply plants and utilities also
    require large quantities of aggregates in their foundations and
    structures. These types of infrastructure-related construction
    can be four times more aggregates-intensive than residential
    construction. Generally, nonresidential buildings require two to
    three times as much aggregates per dollar of spending as a new
    home with most of the aggregates used in the foundations,
    building structure and parking lots.

U.S.
    AGGREGATES DEMAND BY END-MARKET

Source: internal estimates

In addition, the following factors influence the aggregates
    market:

§

HIGHLY FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY:

The U.S. aggregates
    industry is composed of approximately 5,000 companies that
    manage more than 9,000 operations. This fragmented structure
    provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the
    industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in
    existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

RELATIVELY STABLE DEMAND FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR:

Publicly
    funded construction activity  has historically been more stable
    than privately funded construction. Public construction also has
    been less cyclical than private construction and requires more
    aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private
    construction (primarily residential and nonresidential
    buildings) is typically more affected by general economic cycles
    than public construction. Publicly funded projects (particularly
    highways, roads and bridges) tend to receive more consistent
    levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

§

LIMITED PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION:

With few exceptions, there
    are no practical substitutes for quality aggregates. In urban
    locations, recycled concrete has limited applications as a
    lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, many types
    of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete
    but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications
    and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and
    other qualities.

Part
    I



§

WIDELY USED IN DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTS:

In the production
    process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or
    uses. Two products that use aggregates are asphalt mix and
    ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise
    approximately 95% of asphalt mix and 78% of ready-mixed concrete.

§

FLEXIBLE PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES:

The production of
    aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed
    and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes
    depending on how it will be used. Aggregates plants do not
    require high

start-up

costs and typically have lower fixed costs than continuous
    process manufacturing operations. Production capacity can be
    flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market
    demand. For example, we reduced production during 2009 and 2010
    in response to the economic downturn but retain the capacity to
    quickly increase production as economic conditions and demand
    improve.

§

NO RAW MATERIAL INPUTS:

Unlike typical industrial
    manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not
    require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased
    aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally
    occurring resources. However, production does require the use of
    explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.

OUR
    MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with the greatest
    expected population growth and where construction is expected to
    expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the
    delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically
    located in the markets they serve or with access to economical
    transportation to their markets. We serve both the public and
    the private sectors.

PUBLIC
    SECTOR

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state,
    and local governments for highways, bridges and airports as well
    as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste
    disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and
    other public construction projects. Construction for power
    plants and other utilities is funded from both public and
    private sources. In 2010, publicly funded construction accounted
    for 55% of our total aggregates shipments.

PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDING:

Generally, public sector
    construction spending is more stable than private sector
    construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to
    interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year
    legislation and programs. For example, the federal
    transportation bill is a principal source of federal funding for
    public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two
    decades, projects have been funded through a series of
    multi-year bills. The long-term aspect of these bills is
    critical because it provides state departments of transportation
    with the ability to plan and execute long-term and complex
    highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by
    multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations
    using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund.
    This trust receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other
    levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies
    across the United States and depends on individual state needs
    and economies. In 2010, approximately 30% of our aggregates
    sales by volume were used in highway construction projects.

CHANGES IN MULTI-YEAR FUNDING:

The most recent federal
    transportation bill, known as SAFETEA-LU, expired on
    September 30, 2009. Congress has yet to pass a replacement
    bill. As a result, funds for highway construction are being
    provided by a series of authorized extensions with
    appropriations at fiscal year 2010 levels. This uncertainty in
    funding may lead some states to defer large multi-year projects
    until such time as there is greater certainty of funding.

NEED FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE:

A significant need exists
    for additional and ongoing investments in the nation’s
    infrastructure. In 2009, a report by the American Society of
    Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave our nation’s infrastructure an
    overall grade of “D” and estimated that an investment
    of $2.2 trillion over a five-year period is needed for
    improvements. While the needs are clear, the source of funding
    for infrastructure improvements is not. In its report, the ASCE
    suggests that all levels of government, owners and users need to
    renew their commitment to infrastructure investments in all
    categories and that all available financing options should be
    explored and debated.

Part
    I



FEDERAL STIMULUS IMPACT:

The American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Stimulus or ARRA) was signed into law on
    February 17, 2009 to create jobs and restore economic
    growth through, among other things, the modernization of
    America’s infrastructure and improving its energy
    resources. Included in the $787 billion of economic
    stimulus funding is $50 to $60 billion of heavy
    construction, including $27.5 billion for highways and
    bridges. This federal funding for highways and bridges, unlike
    typical federal funding programs for infrastructure, does not require states to provide matching funds. The nature of
    the projects that are being funded by ARRA generally will
    require considerable quantities of aggregates.

Publicly-funded construction activity increased in 2010 due mostly to
the Stimulus. According to the Federal Highway Administration,
approximately $7.1 billion or 43% of the total Stimulus funds
apportioned for highways and bridges in Vulcan-served states remains
to be spent. The pace of obligating, bidding, awarding and starting
stimulus-related highway construction projects has varied widely
across states. These state-by-state differences in awarding projects
and spending patterns are due, in part, to the types of planned
projects and to the proportion sub-allocated to metropolitan planning
organizations where project planning and execution can be more
complicated and time consuming.

Despite the failure of Congress to pass a fully-funded extension
    of SAFETEA-LU (the previous highway authorization that expired
    on September 30, 2009), total contract awards for federal,
    state and local highways in 2010 increased 2% from 2009.
    Moreover, contract awards for public highway projects in
    Vulcan-served states increased 5% from the prior year versus a
    2% decline in other states. We are encouraged by the increased
    award activity and are optimistic that stimulus-related highway
    projects in Vulcan-served states will increase demand for our
    products in 2011.

PRIVATE
    SECTOR

The private sector market includes both nonresidential buildings
    and residential construction and is more cyclical than public
    construction. In 2010, privately-funded construction accounted
    for 45% of our total aggregates shipments.

NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:

Private nonresidential
    construction includes a wide array of types of projects. Such
    projects generally are more aggregates intensive than
    residential construction, but less aggregates intensive than
    public construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential
    construction is generally driven by job growth, vacancy rates,
    private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth
    of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and
    restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for
    stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well
    as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large
    industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can
    increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts
    and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is
    influenced by a firm’s ability to finance a project and the
    cost of such financing.

Consistent with past cycles of private sector construction,
    private nonresidential construction remained strong after
    residential construction peaked in 2006. However, in late 2007,
    contract awards for nonresidential buildings peaked. In 2008,
    contract awards in the U.S. declined 24% from the prior
    year and in 2009 fell sharply, declining 56% from 2008 levels.
    Contract awards for stores and office buildings were the weakest
    categories of nonresidential construction in 2009, declining
    more than 60% from the prior year. Employment growth, more
    attractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy
    will help drive growth in construction activity in this end
    market.

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:

The majority of residential
    construction is for single-family houses with the remainder
    consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family
    houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing
    comprises only a small portion of the housing demand. Household
    formations in Vulcan’s markets have grown faster than the
    U.S. as a whole in the last 10 years. During that
    time, household growth was 12% in our markets compared to 6% in
    the remainder of the U.S. Construction activity in this end
    market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage
    financing. Demand for our products generally occurs early in the
    infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as
    part of driveways or parking lots.

Part
    I



U.S. housing starts, as measured by McGraw-Hill data,
    peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By
    the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than
    600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of
    approximately 1 million units annually. However, in the
    summer of 2009, single-family housing starts began to stabilize
    as evidenced by the graph below. By the end of 2010, single-family
    starts exhibited some modest growth, breaking  almost four
    consecutive years of decline.

PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION
    ACTIVITY COMPARISON

(Trailing Twelve Months Ending
    Dec. 2004 =100)

Source: McGraw-Hill

In 2010, total U.S. housing starts increased 4% from the
    prior year. While these results don’t necessarily indicate
    a sustained recovery in residential construction, the modest
    improvement in construction activity is encouraging. Lower home
    prices, attractive mortgage interest rates and fewer existing
    homes for sale provide some optimism for housing construction in
    2011 and beyond.

ADDITIONAL
    AGGREGATES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS

We sell ballast to railroads for construction and maintenance of
    railroad track. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion
    control along waterways. In addition, stone can be used as
    a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety
    of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants
    use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions.
    Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as
    agricultural lime.

OUR
    COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

We are the largest producer of construction aggregates in the
    United States. The aggregates market is highly fragmented with
    many small, independent producers. Therefore, depending on the
    market, we may compete with large national or regional firms as
    well as relatively small local producers. Since construction
    aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value,
    markets generally are local in nature. Thus, the cost to deliver
    product to the location where it is used is an important
    competitive factor.

Part
    I



We serve metropolitan areas that demographers expect will
    experience the largest absolute growth in population in the
    future. A market often consists of a single metropolitan area or
    one or more counties where transportation from the producing
    location to the customer is by truck only. Approximately 80% of
    our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively by
    truck, and another 13% are delivered by truck after reaching a
    sales yard. Sales yards and other distribution facilities
    located on waterways and rail lines allow us to reach markets
    that do not have locally available sources of aggregates.

Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it
    increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop
    new quarries. However, such regulations, while potentially
    curtailing expansion in certain areas, could also increase the
    value of our reserves at existing locations.

We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates
    outside of the United States, principally in the areas
    surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
    Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United
    States are reported in Note 15 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Item 8 “Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data.”

2. CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in Arizona, California,
    Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia.
    Additionally, we produce and sell, in a limited number of these
    markets, other concrete products such as block and pre-cast
    beams. We also resell purchased building materials for use with
    ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning
    essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations.
    Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete,
    comprising approximately 78% by weight of this product. We meet
    the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment almost
    wholly through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers
    are made at local market prices for the particular grade and
    quality of material required.

We  serve our Concrete segment customers  from our local production facilities or by truck. Because
    ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is
    within  close proximity to the producing facility.

Ready-mixed concrete production also requires cement. In the
    Florida market, cement requirements for ready-mixed concrete
    production are supplied substantially by our Cement segment. In
    other markets, we purchase cement from third-party suppliers.
    We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the
    raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

3. ASPHALT MIX

We produce and sell asphalt mix in Arizona, California, New
    Mexico and Texas. This segment relies on our reserves of
    aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our
    aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in
    asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this
    product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt mix
    segment almost wholly through our Aggregates segment. These
    product transfers are made at local market prices for the
    particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is
    within  close proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt
    production process requires liquid asphalt, which we purchase
    entirely from third-party producers. We serve our Asphalt mix
    segment customers from our local production facilities or by
    truck.

4. CEMENT

Our Newberry, Florida cement plant produces Portland and masonry
    cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete
    products industry. Our Tampa, Florida facility can import and
    export cement and slag. Some of the imported cement is resold,
    and the balance of the cement is blended, bagged, or reprocessed
    into specialty cements that we then sell. The slag is ground and
    sold in blended or unblended form. Our Port Manatee, Florida
    facility can import cement clinker

Part
    I



that is ground into bulk
    cement and sold. Our Brooksville, Florida plant produces calcium
    products for the animal feed, paint, plastics and joint compound
    industries.

The Cement segment’s largest single customer is our own
    ready-mixed concrete operations within the Concrete segment.

During 2010, we began operating the newly expanded Newberry
    cement facility. This plant is supplied by limestone mined at
    the facility. These limestone reserves total 192.7 million
    tons.

Our Brooksville, Florida calcium facility is supplied with high
    quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville
    quarry. The calcium carbonate reserves at this quarry total
     6.3 million tons.

OTHER BUSINESS
    RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY
    AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all our products are produced and consumed outdoors.
    Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect
    the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the
    financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate
    the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales
    and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the
    first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive
    to national, regional and local economic conditions and
    particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending,
    primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction
    spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic
    and population fluctuations.

CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business is dependent upon any customers
    whose loss would have an adverse effect on our business. In
    2010, our top five customers accounted for 4.3% of our total
    revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer
    accounted for more than 1.3% of our total revenues. Our products
    typically are sold to private industry and not directly to
    governmental entities. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our
    aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly
    funded construction, such as highways, airports and government
    buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to
    federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies.
    Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can
    curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not
    directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of
    contracts with state or federal governments.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

We conduct research and development and technical service
    activities at our Technical Service Center in Birmingham,
    Alabama. In general, these efforts are directed toward new and
    more efficient uses of our products and support customers in
    pursuing the most efficient use of our products. We spent
    $1.6 million in 2010 and $1.5 million in both 2009 and
    2008 on research and development activities.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and
    regulations relating to the environment and to health and
    safety, including regulation of noise, water discharge, air
    quality, dust control, zoning and permitting. We estimate that
    capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in
    2011 and 2012 will be approximately $8.4 million and
    $10.5 million, respectively.

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or
    contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites.
    These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial
    statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The
    fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated
    over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The
    liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To
    determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted
    for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin.

Part
    I



All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually.
    Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or
    residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However,
    no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been
    considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation
    liability.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations
    (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement
    obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Item 8 “Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data.”

    AND TRADEMARKS

We do not own or have a license or other rights under any
    patents, trademarks or trade names that are material to any of
    our reporting segments.

OTHER
    INFORMATION REGARDING VULCAN

Vulcan is a New Jersey corporation incorporated on
    February 14, 2007, but its predecessor company was
    incorporated on September 27, 1956. Our principal sources
    of energy are electricity, diesel fuel, natural gas and coal. We
    do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy
    required for operation of any of our reporting segments (i.e.,
    Aggregates, Concrete, Asphalt mix, and Cement).

As of January 1, 2011, we employed 7,749 people in the
    U.S. Of these employees, 795 are represented by labor
    unions. We also employ 245 union hourly employees in Mexico. We
    do not anticipate any significant issues with such unions in
    2011.

We do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to, or a
    significant factor in, evaluating and understanding our business.

ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should
    carefully consider the following risks, together with the
    information included in or incorporated by reference in this
    report, before deciding whether an investment in our common
    stock is suitable for you. If any of these risks actually
    occurs, our business, results of operations or financial
    condition could be materially and adversely affected. In such an
    event, the trading prices of our common stock could decline and
    you might lose all or part of your investment. The following is
    a list of our risk factors.

FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING
    RISKS

We incurred additional debt to finance the Florida Rock
    merger which significantly increased our interest expense,
    financial leverage and debt service requirements —

We incurred considerable short-term and long-term debt to
    finance the Florida Rock merger. This debt, which significantly
    increased our leverage, has been a significant factor resulting
    in downgrades in our credit ratings.

Our cash flow is reduced by payments of principal and interest
    on this debt. Our debt instruments contain various financial and
    contractual restrictions. If we fail to comply with any of these
    covenants, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated
    indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated
    maturity. An event of default under our debt instruments

Part
    I



also
    could significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or
    alternative financing. Our debt ratings are currently under
    review for possible downgrade. If one or both rating agencies
    downgrade our ratings, it could further affect our ability to
    access financing.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our
    obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our
    operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject
    to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and
    other factors some of which are beyond our control.

Difficult and volatile conditions in the credit markets could
    affect our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows —

The current economic environment has
    negatively affected the U.S. economy and demand for our
    products. Commercial and residential construction may continue
    to decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance
    construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to
    cause delays or cancellations of capital projects.

A slow economic recovery also may increase the likelihood we
    will not be able to collect on our accounts receivable from our
    customers. We have experienced payment delays from some of our
    customers during this economic downturn.

The credit environment could limit our ability to obtain
    additional financing or refinancing and, if available, it may
    not be at economically favorable terms. Interest rates on new
    issuances of long-term public debt in the market may increase
    due to higher credit spreads and risk premiums. There is no
    guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at
    favorable interest rates, which could negatively affect our
    financial results.

We may need to obtain financing in order to fund certain
    strategic acquisitions, if they arise, or refinance our
    outstanding debt. We also are exposed to risks from tightening
    credit markets, especially in regard to access to debt and
    equity capital.

Our industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant
    fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly
    sensitive to changes in volume —

Due to the high
    levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing
    construction aggregates, both our dollar profits and our
    percentage of net sales (margin) can be negatively affected by
    decreases in volume.

We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant
    items. Changes in our estimates could affect our future
    financial results —

As discussed more fully in
    “Critical Accounting Policies” under Item 6
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations,” we use significant
    judgment in accounting for

§

goodwill and goodwill impairment

§

impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

§

reclamation costs

§

pension and other postretirement benefits

§

environmental compliance

§

claims and litigation including self-insurance

§

income taxes

We believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable
    procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and
    formulate reasonable estimates; however, these assumptions and
    estimates could change significantly in the future and could
    adversely affect our financial position, results of operations,
    or cash flows.

ECONOMIC/POLITICAL
    RISKS

Both commercial and residential construction are dependent
    upon the overall U.S. economy which has been recovering at
    a slow pace —

Commercial and residential
    construction levels generally move with economic cycles. When
    the economy is strong, construction levels rise and when the
    economy is weak, construction levels fall. The overall
    U.S. economy has been adversely affected by this recession.
    Although most economists believe that the U.S. economy is
    now in recovery, the pace of recovery has been very slow. Since
    construction activity generally lags the recovery after down
    cycles, construction projects have not returned to their
    pre-recession levels.

Above average number of foreclosures, low housing starts and
    general weakness in the housing market continue to negatively
    affect demand for our products —

In most of our
    markets, particularly Florida and California, sales volumes have
    been negatively impacted by foreclosures and a significant
    decline in residential construction. Our sales volumes and
    earnings

Part
    I



could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted
    by this segment of the market until the recovery in residential
    construction improves.

Lack of a multi-year federal highway bill and changes to the
    funding mechanism for highway funding could cause states to
    spend less on roads —

The last multi-year federal
    transportation bill, known as SAFETEA-LU, expired on
    September 30, 2009. Since that time, funding for
    transportation projects, including highways, has been provided
    pursuant to a series of continuing resolutions and the HIRE Act.
    The current continuing resolution is set to expire on
    March 4, 2011. Additionally, in January 2011, the House
    passed a new rules package that repealed transportation law
    dating back to 1998, which protected annual funding levels from
    amendments that could reduce such funding. This rule change
    subjects funding for highways to yearly appropriation reviews.
    Both the lack of a multi-year bill and the change in the funding
    mechanism increases the uncertainty of many state departments of
    transportation regarding funds for highway projects. This
    uncertainty could result in states being reluctant to undertake
    large multi-year highway projects which could, in turn,
    negatively affect our sales.

Changes in legal requirements and governmental policies
    concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of
    the law impact our business —

Our operations are
    affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and
    regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental
    matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent
    risk of liability in the operation of our business, especially
    from an environmental standpoint. These potential liabilities
    could have an adverse impact on our operations and
    profitability. In addition, our operations require numerous
    governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to
    make significant capital and maintenance expenditures to comply
    with zoning and environmental laws and regulations. Stricter
    laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of
    existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us,
    reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in
    pollution control equipment, or impede our opening new or
    expanding existing plants or facilities.

Climate change and climate change legislation or regulations
    may adversely impact our business —

A number of
    governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating
    legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential
    impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if
    enacted, potentially could include provisions for a “cap
    and trade” system of allowances and credits, among other
    provisions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas
    emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The EPA
    has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule,
    referred to as the “Tailoring Rule” which requires
    permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the
    Federal Clean Air Act. We have determined that our Newbery
    cement plant is subject to both the reporting rule and the
    permitting rule, although the impacts of the permitting rule are
    uncertain at this time. The first required greenhouse gas
    emissions report for the Newberry cement plant will be submitted
    to the Federal EPA by March 31, 2011.

Other potential impacts of climate change include physical
    impacts such as disruption in production and product
    distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in
    regional weather patterns and intensities, and potential impacts
    from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate
    change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost
    of purchased energy and electricity.

The impacts of climate change on our operations and the company
    overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However,
    climate change and legislation and regulation concerning
    greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our
    future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

GROWTH AND
    COMPETITIVE RISKS

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive
    industry —

The construction aggregates industry is
    highly fragmented with a large number of independent local
    producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most
    markets, we also compete against large private and public
    companies, some of which are more vertically integrated than we
    are. Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of
    markets in which we operate. This significant competition could
    lead to lower prices, lower sales volumes and higher costs in
    some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.
    In certain markets, vertically integrated competitors have
    acquired a portion of our asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete
    customers and this trend may continue to accelerate.

Our long-term success depends upon securing and permitting
    aggregates reserves in strategically located areas —

Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore,
    difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production
    costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not
    possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are
    served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be
    very localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck.
    New quarry sites often take a number of years to develop,

Part
    I



therefore our strategic planning and new site development must
    stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban
    and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly
    difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to
    community resistance. Therefore, our future success is
    dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future
    areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites
    and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits
    to operate at those sites.

Our future growth depends in part on acquiring other
    businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them
    with our existing operations —

The expansion of
    our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing
    businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions
    in the availability of credit and financing could make it more
    difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally,
    with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our
    future results will be dependent in part on our ability to
    successfully integrate these businesses with our existing
    operations.

PERSONNEL
    RISKS

Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and
    retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and
    operations —

A significant factor in our future
    profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain
    qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified
    personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is
    affected by changing demographics of the available pool of
    workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the
    available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to
    general economic conditions, and our ability to offer
    competitive compensation and benefit packages.

The costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our
    employees have risen in recent years. Continuing increases in
    such costs could negatively affect our earnings —

The costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to
    our employees have increased substantially over the past several
    years. We have instituted measures to help slow the rate of
    increase. However, if these costs continue to rise, we could
    suffer an adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

OTHER
    RISKS

Weather can materially affect our operating
    results —

Almost all of our products are used in
    the public or private construction industry, and our production
    and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement
    weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our
    products and affects our customers’ short-term demand
    because their work also can be hampered by weather. Therefore,
    our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement
    weather.

Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship,
    primarily by third-party providers. Significant delays or
    increased costs affecting these transportation methods could
    materially affect our operations and earnings —

Our products are distributed either by truck to local
    markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote
    markets. The costs of transporting our products could be
    negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including
    rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising
    fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally, inclement
    weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather
    events, can negatively impact our distribution network.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid
    asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to
    potential supply constraints and significant price
    fluctuation —

In our production and distribution
    processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel
    fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The
    availability and pricing of these resources are subject to
    market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers
    contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our
    sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not
    be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other
    factors that interrupt their availability. Variability in the
    supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our
    operating results from period to period and rising costs could
    erode our profitability.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot
    predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with
    certainty —

We are involved in several class
    action and complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our
    previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals business.
    Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we
    retained certain liabilities related to the business. As
    required by generally accepted accounting principles, we
    establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and
    the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and
    loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to
    us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in
    legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a
    loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For a
    description of our current significant legal proceedings see
    Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies” in
    Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.”

We are involved in certain environmental matters. We cannot
    predict the outcome of these contingencies with
    certainty —

We are involved in environmental
    investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have
    operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or
    disposal, primarily in connection with our divested Chemicals
    and Metals businesses. As required by generally accepted
    accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is
    determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably
    estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are
    based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular
    point in time. Subsequent developments related to these matters
    may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency, and
    could result in an adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows. For a description of our
    current significant environmental matters see Note 12
    “Commitments and Contingencies” in Item 8

PROPERTIES

AGGREGATES

As the largest U.S. producer of construction aggregates, we
    have operating facilities across the U.S. and in Mexico and
    the Bahamas. We principally serve markets in 21 states, the
    District of Columbia and the local markets surrounding our
    operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is
    serving states and metropolitan markets in the U.S. that
    are expected to experience the most significant growth in
    population, households and employment. These three demographic
    factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates.

Part
    I



Our current estimate of 14.7 billion tons of proven and
    probable aggregates reserves reflects an increase of
    0.5 billion tons from the estimate at the end of 2009.
    Estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel
    of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling
    and studies by our geologists and engineers, recognizing
    reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth
    of overburden and stone excavation, and subject to permit or
    other restrictions.

Proven, or measured, reserves are those reserves for which the
    quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data,
    together with other direct and measurable observations such as
    outcrops, trenches and quarry faces. The grade and quality of
    those reserves are computed from the results of detailed
    sampling, and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so
    closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size,
    shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well
    established. Probable, or indicated, reserves are those reserves
    for which quantity and grade and quality are computed partly
    from specific measurements and partly from projections based on
    reasonable, though not drilled, geologic evidence. The degree of
    assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high
    enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

Reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities
    that are owned in fee or under lease, and for which all
    appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained. Leases,
    zoning, permits, reclamation plans and other government or
    industry regulations often set limits on the areas, depths and
    lengths of time allowed for mining, stipulate setbacks and
    slopes that must be left in place, and designate which areas may
    be used for surface facilities, berms, and overburden or waste
    storage, among other requirements and restrictions. Our reserves
    estimates take into account these factors. Technical and
    economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves
    regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or
    probable based on a geologic analysis. For example, excessive
    overburden or weathered rock, rock quality issues, excessive
    mining depths, groundwater issues, overlying wetlands,
    endangered species habitats, and rights of way or easements may
    effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and
    probable. In addition, computations for reserves in-place are
    adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well
    as pit and plant waste.

The 14.7 billion tons of estimated aggregates reserves
    reported at the end of 2010 include reserves at inactive and
    greenfield (undeveloped) sites. We reported proven and probable
    reserves of 14.2 billion tons at the end of 2009 using the
    same basis. The table below presents, by division, the tons of
    proven and probable aggregates reserves as of December 31,
    2010 and the types of facilities operated.

Of the 14.7 billion tons of aggregates reserves,
    8.3 billion tons or 56% are located on owned land and
    6.4 billion tons or 44% are located on leased land. While
    some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are
    exhausted, generally our leases have definite expiration dates,
    which range from 2011 to 2159. Most of our leases have renewal
    options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our
    discretion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

KEY DRIVERS OF
    VALUE CREATION

*

Source: Moody’s
    Analytics

FINANCIAL
    SUMMARY FOR 2010

§

Net earnings were a loss of $96.5 million or ($0.75) per
    diluted share

§

EBITDA was $370.6 million compared to $548.4 million
    in 2009

§

Pretax charges of $43.0 million related to the settlement
    of a lawsuit in Illinois and a $39.5 million pretax gain
    associated with the sale of non-strategic assets in rural
    Virginia

§

Unit cost for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt increased 30% and
    20%, respectively, reducing pretax earnings $51.3 million

§

Freight-adjusted selling prices for aggregates declined 2% due
    principally to weakness in Florida and California

§

Aggregates shipments declined 2% reflecting varied market demand
    conditions across our footprint

§

Full year capital spending was $86.3 million compared with
    $109.7 million in 2009

STABILIZING MARKETS IN 2010

In 2010, the

year-over-year

decline in trailing twelve-month aggregates shipments slowed
    significantly from the prior three years. During the period from
    2007 through 2009, aggregates shipments — adjusted to
    include major acquisitions and exclude divestitures —
    declined 11% in 2007, 21% in 2008 and 26% in 2009. In 2010,
    aggregates shipments declined only 2% from the prior year
    reflecting varied market demand conditions across our markets.
    Aggregates shipments in 2010 benefited from increased highway
    construction activity and some improvement in housing. New home
    construction declined to historically low levels in 2009. Then,
    after 43 consecutive months of

year-over-year

declines, single-family housing starts

Part
    II



began to improve in late 2009. By the end of 2010, full year single-family housing
    starts, as measured by McGraw-Hill Construction, had increased
    2% from 2009 and multi-family housing starts increased 8%. Tight
    credit has contributed to a sharp decrease in construction of
    nonresidential buildings, particularly stores and offices.
    However, the rate of decline in private nonresidential
    construction began to slow late in 2010. Construction activity
    funded by the public sector, typically less affected in economic
    cycles, increased in 2010 due mostly to the American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). During the twelve months ended December 2010, total contract awards for highway
    construction in Vulcan-served states, including awards for
    federal, state and local projects, increased 5% from the prior
    year compared to a decrease of 2% for other states. The positive
    effects of ARRA spending in 2010 were somewhat offset by the
    failure of Congress to reauthorize the most recent multi-year
    federal transportation bill known as SAFETEA-LU, which expired
    on September 30, 2009. The federal transportation program
    was funded through a series of short-term extensions in late
    2009 and early 2010. Passage of the Hiring Incentives to Restore
    Employment (HIRE) Act in March 2010 included authorized funding
    for transportation programs through December 31, 2010.

ARRA includes economic stimulus funding of $50 to
    $60 billion for heavy construction projects, including
    $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. Vulcan-served
    states were apportioned 55% more funds than other states; with
    California, Texas and Florida receiving 23% of the total for
    highways and bridges. The challenge of meeting ARRA deadlines to
    ensure use of federal funds, coupled with the uncertainty
    surrounding the regular federal highway bill, led many states to
    slow the pace of obligating new projects funded by regular
    federal funding for highways during the first nine months of
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. During the last three
    months of the fiscal year 2010, obligation of funds for projects
    was at record levels.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, approximately
    $7.1 billion or 43% of the total stimulus funds apportioned
    for highways and bridges in Vulcan-served states remains to be
    spent. The vast majority of this unspent amount,
    $5.4 billion, is located in Vulcan’s top 10 revenue
    producing states — California, Virginia, Florida,
    Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Alabama and
    South Carolina.

The pace of obligating, bidding, awarding and starting
    stimulus-related highway construction projects has varied widely
    across states. These

state-by-state

differences in awarding projects and spending patterns are due,
    in part, to the types of planned projects and to the proportion

sub-allocated

to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning
    and execution can be more complicated and time consuming.

We have worked diligently throughout this downturn to position
    our company for earnings growth when demand recovers. Improved
    stability in the economic factors that drive demand for our
    products will bring the strength of our fundamentals back into
    focus. Vulcan

§

preserved reasonably stable aggregates pricing during the worst
    year of demand

§

maintained productivity levels despite slightly lower sales
    volumes

§

controlled selling, administrative and general expenses

As a result of these efforts, cash earnings for each ton of
    aggregates sold in 2010 was 26% higher than at the peak of
    demand in 2005.

RECONCILIATION OF
    NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) does not define
    “free cash flow” and “Earnings Before Interest,
    Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA).” Thus, they
    should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided
    by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings
    measure defined by GAAP. We present these metrics for the
    convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in
    their analysis, and for shareholders who need to understand the
    metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and
    liquidity positions. The investment community often uses these
    metrics as indicators of a company’s ability to incur and
    service debt. We use free cash flow, EBITDA and other such
    measures to assess the operating performance of our various
    business units and the consolidated company. We do not use these
    metrics as a measure to allocate resources. Reconciliations of
    these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Intersegment sales are internal sales between any of our four
    operating segments:

1.  Aggregates

2.  Concrete

3.  Asphalt mix

4.  Cement

Intersegment sales consist of our Aggregates and Cement segments
    selling product to our Concrete segment and our Aggregates
    segment selling product to our Asphalt mix segment. We include
    intersegment sales in our comparative analysis of segment
    revenue at the product line level. These intersegment sales are
    made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality
    of material required. Net sales and cost of goods sold exclude
    intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost. This
    presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review
    results of operations. We discuss separately our discontinued
    operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business.

The following table shows net earnings in relationship to net
    sales, cost of goods sold, operating earnings and EBITDA.

The length and depth of the decline in construction activity and
    aggregates demand during this economic downturn have been
    unprecedented. Our aggregates shipments in 2010 were just over
    half the level shipped in 2005 when demand peaked. We continued
    to manage our business to maximize cash generation. In 2010, we
    again reduced inventory levels of aggregates. While this action
    negatively affected reported earnings, it increased cash
    generation and better positions us to increase production and
    earnings as demand recovers. We also continued to reduce our
    overhead expenses. Cost associated with implementing some of
    these reductions increased selling, administrative and general expense in 2010;
    however, the benefits of these overhead reductions should be
    realized in 2011 and beyond.

Part
    II



The 2010 results include $43.0 million of pretax charges
    related to the settlement of a lawsuit with the Illinois
    Department of Transportation (IDOT), a $39.5 million pretax
    gain associated with the sale of non-strategic assets in rural
    Virginia and increased pretax costs of $51.4 million
    related to higher unit costs for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt.
    While we believed that the IDOT settlement was covered by
    insurance, we did not recognize its recovery as of
    December 31, 2010 due to uncertainty as to the amount and
    timing of a recovery. However, in February 2011 we completed the
    first of two arbitrations in which two of our three insurers
    participated. The arbitration panel awarded us a total of
    $25.5 million in payment of their share of the settlement
    amount and attorneys’ fees. This award will be recorded as
    income in the first quarter of 2011.

The 2008 results include a $252.7 million pretax goodwill
    impairment charge for our Cement segment. The 2008 results also
    include a $73.8 million pretax gain from the sale of mining
    operations divested as a condition for approval of the Florida
    Rock acquisition by the Department of Justice.

OPERATING
    RESULTS BY SEGMENT

We present our results of operations by segment at the gross
    profit level. We have four reporting segments organized around
    our principal product lines: 1) aggregates,
    2) concrete, 3) asphalt mix and 4) cement.
    Management reviews earnings for the product line segments
    principally at the gross profit level.

aggregates shipments declined

§

26% in 2009

§

12% in 2008

To date, the economic recovery has not had a significant effect
    on some of our key end-markets or key regional markets. As a
    result, market conditions varied across our markets throughout
    the year. Aggregates shipments declined sharply in certain
    markets such as North Carolina, Florida and Georgia, while
    shipments increased modestly in other markets such as South
    Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.

Our

year-over-year

aggregates selling price

declined 2% in 2010

§

§

improved 7% in 2008

Since 2006, our aggregates selling price has cumulatively
    increased 22%. The 2010 decline in aggregates selling price was
    due primarily to weakness in demand in Florida and California.
    In Florida, demand remained relatively weak throughout the year
    while demand for aggregates in California exhibited some modest
    growth in the fourth quarter versus 2009.

We continued tight management of our controllable plant

The

increase in ready-mixed concrete shipments resulted from the
    November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock and the resulting full
    year of shipments in 2008 versus only two months in 2007.

The average selling price for ready-mixed concrete declined 10%
    in 2010 and accounted for the

year-over-year

decline in this segment’s gross profit. Raw material costs
    were lower than 2009 and more than offset the effects of a 5%
    decline in shipments.

Asphalt mix segment earnings declined $39.7 million from
    2009 due mostly to a 20% increase in the average unit cost for
    liquid asphalt. Higher liquid asphalt costs lowered segment
    earnings $27.1 million in 2010. The average selling price
    for asphalt mix declined 4% as selling prices for asphalt mix
    generally lag increasing liquid asphalt costs and were further
    held in check due to competitive pressures.

CEMENT

The average unit selling price for cement decreased 17%, more
    than offsetting the earnings effect of a 32% increase in unit
    sales volumes. The increase in unit sales volumes was primarily
    attributable to an increase in intersegment sales.

SELLING,
    ADMINISTRATIVE AND

GENERAL EXPENSES

Additional costs associated with implementing some overhead
    expense reductions actually increased Selling, Administrative
    and General (SAG) expenses for 2010. However, the benefits of
    these overhead reductions should be realized in 2011 and beyond.
    On a comparable basis, SAG costs in 2010 were $4.1 million
    lower than 2009. Benefits related to our project to replace
    legacy IT systems began to be realized in 2010, reducing project
    costs for the year. We expect additional benefits from this
    project in 2011. The 2009 decline in SAG cost was due primarily
    to reductions in employee-related expenses which more than
    offset a

year-over-year

increase in project costs for the replacement of legacy IT
    systems.

Part
    II



SAG includes expenses for property donations recorded at fair
    value, as follows: $9.2 million in 2010, $8.5 million
    in 2009 and $10.5 million in 2008. The gains from these
    donations, which are equal to the excess of the fair value over
    the carrying value, are included in gain on sale of property,
    plant & equipment in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Excluding the effect of these
    property donations, SAG expenses increased $5.2 million in
    2010 and decreased $19.0 million in 2009.

GOODWILL
    IMPAIRMENT

There were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2010 and 2009.
    During 2008, we recorded a $252.7 million pretax goodwill
    impairment charge related to our Cement segment, representing
    the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit. We
    acquired these operations as part of the Florida Rock
    transaction in November 2007. For additional details regarding
    this impairment, see the Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment
    Critical Accounting Policy.

GAIN
    ON SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT &

EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET

The 2010 gain includes a $39.5 million pretax gain
    associated with the sale of non-strategic assets in rural
    Virginia. The 2009 gain was primarily related to sales and
    donations of real estate, mostly in California. Included in the
    2008 gains was a $73.8 million pretax gain for quarry sites
    divested as a condition for approval of the Florida Rock
    acquisition by the Department of Justice.

INTEREST
    EXPENSE

Excluding capitalized interest credits, gross interest expense
    for 2010 was $185.2 million compared to $186.0 million
    in 2009 and $187.1 million in 2008.

The $51.8 million increase in our 2010 benefit for income

    operations. The $109.6 million increase in our 2009 benefit
    for income taxes is primarily related to the 2009 loss from
    continuing operations, the nondeductible goodwill impairment
    charge taken in 2008 and the decrease in the state income tax
    provision offset in part by a decrease in the benefit for
    statutory depletion. A reconciliation of the federal statutory
    rate of 35% to our effective tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008
    is presented in Note 9, “Income Taxes” in
    Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.”

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Pretax earnings (loss) from discontinued operations were

§

$10.0 million in 2010

§

$19.5 million in 2009

§

($4.1) million in 2008

The 2010 pretax earnings include pretax gains totaling
    $13.9 million related to the 5CP earn-out and a recovery
    from an insurer in the perchloroethylene lawsuits associated
    with our former Chemicals business. The 2009 pretax earnings
    from discontinued operations resulted primarily from settlements
    with two of our insurers in the aforementioned perchloroethylene
    lawsuits resulting in pretax gains of $23.5 million. The
    insurance proceeds and associated gains represent a partial
    recovery of legal and settlement costs recognized in prior
    years. The 2008 pretax losses from discontinued operations, and
    the remaining results from 2009 and 2010, reflect charges
    primarily related to general and product liability costs,
    including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation
    costs associated with our former Chemicals business. For
    additional information regarding discontinued operations, see
    Note 2 “Discontinued Operations” in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Part
    II



CASH AND LIQUIDITY

Our primary source of liquidity is cash from our operating
    activities. Our additional financial resources include unused
    bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets. We
    believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our
    future business requirements, including

§

debt service obligations

§

cash contractual obligations

§

capital expenditures

§

dividend payments

§

potential future acquisitions

We operate a centralized cash management system using
    zero-balance disbursement accounts; therefore, our operating
    cash balance requirements are minimal. When cash on hand is not
    sufficient to fund daily working capital requirements we draw
    down on our bank lines of credit. The weighted-average interest
    rate on short-term debt, including commissions paid to
    commercial paper broker dealers, when applicable, was 0.52%
    during the year ended December 31, 2010 and 0.59% at
    December 31, 2010.

During 2010, we issued commercial paper consistently during the
    first quarter at rates significantly below the short-term
    borrowing rates available under our bank credit facility. On
    April 7, Standard & Poor’s downgraded our
    short-term credit rating to

A-3

from

A-2.

As a
    result, commercial paper rates rose by about 30 basis
    points (0.30 percentage points). We continued issuing
    commercial paper through mid-July when the entire outstanding
    balance was paid with proceeds from our newly executed
    $450.0 million

5-year

term
    loan. In mid-December, we utilized the revolving bank line of
    credit when we retired the $325.0 million floating rate
    notes issued in 2007.

During the second or third quarter of 2011, we intend to replace
    the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (expires
    November 2012) with a new multi-year facility at a
    substantially reduced level. The new credit facility would
    reflect then current market conditions for syndicated bank loan
    facilities for pricing, terms and conditions, and financial
    covenants.

CURRENT
    MATURITIES AND

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

As of December 31, 2010, current maturities of long-term
    debt are $5.2 million of which $5.0 million is due as
    follows:

There are various maturity dates for the remaining

    drawing on our bank lines of credit or by accessing the capital
    markets.

Our outstanding bank credit facility, which provides
    $1.5 billion of liquidity, expires November 16, 2012.
    Borrowings under this credit facility, which are classified as
    short-term, bear an interest rate based on London Interbank
    Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread. This credit spread was
    30 basis points (0.30 percentage points) based on our
    long-term debt ratings at December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010

§

$285.5 million was drawn from the $1.5 billion line of
    credit

§

$61.9 million was used to provide backup for outstanding
    letters of credit

As a result, we had available lines of credit of
    $1,152.6 million. This amount provides a sizable level of
    borrowing capacity that strengthens our financial flexibility.
    Not only does it enable us to fund working capital needs, it
    provides liquidity to fund large expenditures, such as long-term
    debt maturities, on a temporary basis without being forced to
    issue long-term debt at times that are disadvantageous.

Interest rates referable to borrowings under these credit lines
    are determined at the time of borrowing based on current market
    conditions for LIBOR. Of the $285.5 million drawn as of
    December 31, 2010, $35.5 million was borrowed on an
    overnight basis at 0.56%, $100.0 million was borrowed for
    two months at 0.581% and $150.0 million was borrowed for
    three months at 0.602%. Our policy is to maintain committed
    credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial
    paper. Our short-term debt ratings/outlook as of
    December 31, 2010 were

WORKING
    CAPITAL

Working capital, current assets less current liabilities, is a
    common measure of liquidity used to assess a company’s
    ability to meet short-term obligations. Our working capital is
    calculated as follows:

in millions



Working Capital

$732.9

Current liabilities

(565.7

)

(856.7

)

Total working capital

$206.4

($123.8

The increase in our working capital of $330.2 million was
    primarily the result of a decrease from 2009 to 2010 in current
    maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings of
    $331.1 million. This decrease resulted from the closing of
    the $450.0 million

5-year

term
    loan in July 2010. Proceeds from the term loan were used to pay
    outstanding commercial paper and current maturities of long-term
    debt. We continued to focus on maximizing cash generation in
    2010. We further reduced

Part
    II



total inventory (current and
    noncurrent) levels by $9.5 million compared to 2009 for a
    total reduction of $27.7 million from peak inventory levels
    in 2008. This strategy better positions us to increase
    production and earnings as demand increases. The
increase in accounts and notes
    receivable of $49.8 million was mostly offset by an increase in
    other accrued liabilities of $46.9 million.

Lower net earnings caused the majority of the
    $250.3 million decrease in operating cash flows from 2009
    to 2010. We continued to manage the business to generate cash as
    reflected in the

year-over-year

changes in our working capital accounts, which generated
    $37.2 million of cash in 2010 and $89.7 million of
    cash in 2009. Cash received associated with gains on sale of
    property, plant & equipment and businesses is
    presented as a component of investing activities and accounts
    for $39.5 million of the $250.3 million

year-over-year

decrease in operating cash flows.

Net cash provided by operating
    activities increased by $17.8 million in 2009 compared to
    2008 despite a $217.8 million decrease in earnings before
    noncash deductions for depreciation, depletion, accretion and
    amortization, and goodwill impairment. Changes in working
    capital generated $89.7 million of cash in 2009 as compared
    to using $86.7 million of cash in 2008.

CASH
    FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

Net cash used for investing
    activities totaled $88.4 million in 2010 compared to
    $80.0 million in 2009, an increase of $8.4 million. We
    continued to closely evaluate the nature and timing of all
    capital projects in order to conserve cash. Cash used for the
    purchase of property, plant & equipment totaled
    $86.3 million in 2010, down from $109.7 million in
    2009 and $353.2 million in 2008. Proceeds from the sale of
    non-strategic businesses increased $34.9 million

year-over-year

to $51.0 million in 2010. These positive cash flows were
    more than offset by a $33.6 million increase in payments
    for businesses acquired and a $33.3 million decrease in the
    redemption of medium-term investments.

Cash used for investing activities
    decreased $109.0 million to $80.0 million from 2008 to
    2009 in part due to the aforementioned decrease in cash used for
    the purchase of property, plant & equipment as well as
    a $47.1 million decrease in payments for businesses acquired.
    These decreases were partially offset by a $209.7 million
    decrease in proceeds from the sale of businesses from 2008 to
    2009.

CASH
    FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Net cash used for financing
    activities totaled $89.1 million in 2010, compared to
    $361.0 million during 2009. Debt reduction remains a
    priority use of available cash flows. During 2010, despite a
    significant

year-over-year

decline in cash provided by operating activities, we reduced
    total debt by $19.8 million. Proceeds from the issuance of
    the $450.0 million

5-year

term
    loan in July 2010 were used to pay outstanding commercial paper
    and current maturities of long-term debt.

Part
    II



In the third quarter
    of 2009, we reduced our dividend per share to $0.25 per quarter
    from $0.49 per quarter, resulting in comparative cash savings of
    $91.9 million during 2010.

Cash used for financing activities
    increased $90.1 million from 2008 to 2009 —
    $270.8 million to $361.0 million. During 2009,
    proceeds from issuing long-term debt of $397.7 million and

CAPITAL
    STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES

We pursue attractive investment opportunities and fund
    acquisitions using internally generated cash or by issuing debt
    or equity securities. We actively manage our capital structure
    and resources consistent with the policies, guidelines and
    objectives to maximize shareholder wealth, as well as to attract
    equity and fixed income investors who support us by investing in
    our stock and debt securities. Our primary goals include

§

maintaining a debt to total capital ratio within what we believe
    to be a prudent and generally acceptable range of 35% to 40%

§

paying out a reasonable share of net cash provided by operating
    activities as dividends

§

maintaining credit ratings that allow access to the credit
    markets on favorable terms

Maintaining a leadership position in the U.S. aggregates
    industry has afforded us the opportunity to raise debt and
    equity capital even in some of the most challenging times in the
    modern history of U.S. capital markets. In July 2010, we
    executed a $450.0 million

5-year

term
    loan. The proceeds were used in the third quarter to retire
    commercial paper and current maturities of long-term debt. In
    December 2010, we paid the maturing $325.0 million floating
    rate note with cash on hand and by drawing against our
    $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.

We maintained the quarterly dividend at a quarterly rate of
    $0.25 per share throughout 2010, for a payout of
    $127.8 million. We issued 2,657,864 shares for
    $113.6 million of equity in 2010 for various purposes

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

We follow certain significant accounting policies when we
    prepare our consolidated financial statements. A summary of
    these policies is included in Note 1 “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
    contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
    We base our estimates on historical experience, current
    conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable
    under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and
    judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates
    form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and
    assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our
    actual results may materially differ from these estimates.

Part
    II



We believe the following seven critical accounting policies
    require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

1.  Goodwill and goodwill impairment

2.  Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

3.  Reclamation costs

4.  Pension and other postretirement benefits

5.  Environmental compliance

6.  Claims and litigation including self-insurance

7.  Income taxes

1. GOODWILL
    AND

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets
    acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the
    identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill
    impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is
    less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment
    on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The
    impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because
    goodwill is material to our total assets (as of
    December 31, 2010, goodwill represents 37% of total assets)
    and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and
    assumptions and considerable management judgment. Thus, an
    impairment charge could be material to our financial condition
    and results of operations.

OUR
    ASSUMPTIONS

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be
    reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to
    inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those
    estimates. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment
    with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result
    from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest
    rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant
    underperformance relative to historical or projected future
    operating results. These conditions could result in a
    significantly different estimate of the fair value of our
    reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in
    the future.

The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models
    include our estimate of future profitability, capital
    requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates
    used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets
    and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry.
    Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital
    estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary
    to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was
    derived using a capital asset pricing model.

HOW WE TEST
    GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level
    using a two-step process. We have identified 13 reporting
    units that represent operations or groups of operations one
    level below our operating segments.

STEP 1

We compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying
    value, including goodwill

§

if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of
    the reporting unit is not considered impaired

§

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment
    loss, if any

Part
    II



STEP 2

We compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill
    with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair
    value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the
    fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and
    liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination,
    with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill.

§

if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
    implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
    recognized in an amount equal to that excess

HOW WE DETERMINE
    CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE

First, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by
    assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those
    units as of the measurement date. Then, we estimate the fair
    values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair
    values derived from both an income approach, which involves
    discounting estimated future cash flows, and a market approach,
    which involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples
    of comparable companies. Finally, we consider market factors
    when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our
    valuation models. To substantiate the fair values derived from
    these valuations, we reconcile the implied fair values to our
    market capitalization.

RESULTS OF OUR
    IMPAIRMENT TESTS

The results of our annual impairment tests for

§

November 1, 2010 indicated that the fair values of all
    reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their
    carrying values

§

November 1, 2009 indicated that the fair values of all
    reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their
    carrying values

§

January 1, 2009 indicated that the carrying value of our
    Cement reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Based on the
    results of the second step of the impairment test, we concluded
    that the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting unit was
    impaired, and recorded a $252.7 million pretax goodwill
    impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    fair value of all other reporting units with goodwill
    substantially exceeded their carrying values

For additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 18
    “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

2. IMPAIRMENT
    OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including
    intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting
    policy because long-lived assets are material to our total
    assets (as of December 31, 2010, property,
    plant & equipment, net represents 44% of total assets,
    while other intangible assets, net represents 8% of total
    assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant
    estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment.
    Thus, an impairment charge could be material to our financial
    condition and results of operations. The carrying value of
    long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated
    undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their
    carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the
    amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
    long-lived assets.

Fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash
    flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment
    and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows
    is based on historical experience and assumptions of future
    trends, which may be different from actual results. We
    periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful
    lives of our long-lived assets.

During 2010 we recorded a $3.9 million loss on impairment
    of long-lived assets. The loss on impairment was a result of the
    challenging construction environment which impacted non-strategic
    assets across multiple operating segments. There were no long-lived asset impairments during 2009 and the  recorded
    long-lived asset impairments during  2008 were
    immaterial.

Part
    II



For additional information regarding long-lived assets and
    intangible assets, see Note 4 “Property,
    Plant & Equipment” and Note 18
    “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

3.

RECLAMATION
    COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long-lived
    assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only
    if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon
    retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs
    resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are
    recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal
    obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease.
    The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting
    cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the
    obligating event date and is accreted through charges to
    operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part
    of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated
    over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation
    is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability,
    a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

Reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy
    because of the significant estimates, assumptions and
    considerable management judgment used to determine the fair
    value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of
    these obligations ($162.7 million as of December 31,
    2010).

HOW WE DETERMINE
    FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the
    cost for a third party to perform the legally required
    reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This
    cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and
    an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years
    to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair
    value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted,
    risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to
    settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts
    and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If
    this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement
    dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the
    probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a
    revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement
    date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the
    period that a triggering event occurs that would result in
    either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated
    settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change
    in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an
    existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a
    change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition
    of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations
    (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement
    obligations), see Note 17 “Asset Retirement
    Obligations” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data.”

4. PENSION
    AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that
    we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of
    benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Each
    year we review our assumptions about
    the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate
    of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate
    of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare
    benefits.

§

DISCOUNT RATE — The discount rate is used in
    calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on
    projections of benefit payments to be made in the future

§

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS — We project the future
    return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and
    our expectations for future returns for the types of investments
    held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset
    allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce the
    recorded net benefit costs

§

RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE — For salary-related
    plans only, we project employees’ annual pay increases,
    which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at
    retirement

§

RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE
    BENEFITS — We project the expected increases in the
    cost of covered healthcare benefits

Part
    II



HOW WE SET OUR
    ASSUMPTIONS

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income
    security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. We also
    analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for
    corresponding high-quality bonds. At December 31, 2010, the
    discount rates for our various plans ranged from 4.55% to 5.60%.

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider
    past performance and long-term future expectations for the types
    of investments held by the plan as well as the expected
    long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At
    December 31, 2010, we reduced the expected return on plan
    assets to 8.00% from 8.25%.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider
    past experience and future expectations. At December 31,
    2010, we increased our projected weighted-average rate of
    compensation increase to 3.50% from 3.40%.

In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and
    forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31,
    2010, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered healthcare benefits remained at 8.0% for 2011,
    decreasing each year until reaching 5.0% in 2017 and remaining
    level thereafter.

Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on
    the projected benefit obligations, the accrued other
    postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic
    pension and other postretirement benefit cost. The following
    table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated
    with a change in certain assumptions:

During 2010, the fair value of assets increased from
    $493.6 million to $630.3 million due primarily to
    investment gains and contributions to our qualified pension
    plans in March and July totaling $73.8 million.
    Additionally in 2010, the pension plans received $21.6 million related to
    our investments in Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (WCM).
    These receipts included a $6.6 million release from the
    court-appointed receiver as a partial distribution and a
    $15.0 million insurance settlement for the loss. The
    undistributed balance is held by a court-appointed receiver as a
    result of allegations of fraud and other violations by
    principals of a WCM affiliate. During 2008, we wrote down the
    fair value of our assets invested at WCM by $48.0 million.

During 2011, we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense
    of approximately $24.0 million and net periodic
    postretirement expense of approximately $12.3 million
    compared to $16.9 million and $11.1 million,
    respectively, in 2010. The increase in postretirement expense is
    primarily related to health care reform provisions. The increase
    in pension expense is due primarily to the decrease in the
    discount rate. For the qualified pension plans, the increase in
    pension expense is also due to the 2008 asset losses subject to
    amortization. These increases are offset somewhat by the 2010
    pension contributions, better than expected asset returns during
    2010 and the Westridge recovery. As a result of our 2010 pension
    contributions (related to plan year 2009) of
    $72.5 million in March and $1.3 million in July, we do
    not expect to make any contributions to the funded pension plans
    during 2011. Assuming actuarial assumptions are realized,
    existing funding credit balances are sufficient to fund
    projected minimum required contributions until 2013. We
    currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our
    plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated
    funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.

    operations or for future revenues consistent with our
    capitalization policy

§

expense expenditures for an existing condition caused by past
    operations that do not contribute to future revenues

§

accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation
    efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we
    can reasonably estimate the cost

At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental
    remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the
    uncertainties of varying factors. The range of an estimated
    remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the
    remediation effort occur. When we can estimate a range of
    probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event
    that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most
    likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of
    December 31, 2010, the difference between the amount
    accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for
    which a range can be reasonably estimated was $4.6 million.

Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or
    the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers.
    Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management
    Committee routinely reviews cost estimates, including key
    assumptions, for accruing environmental compliance costs;
    however, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings
    and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts
    progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from
    accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance
    costs, see Note 8 “Accrued Environmental Remediation
    Costs” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data.”

6. CLAIMS
    AND LITIGATION

INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items
    covered under our self-insurance program. We are

self-insured

for losses related to workers’ compensation up to
    $2.0 million per occurrence and automotive and
    general/product liability up to $3.0 million per
    occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis
    beyond these deductible levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims
    and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on
    our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including
    future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain
    claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not
    included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in
    our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when
    incurred.

Part
    II



HOW WE ASSESS THE
    PROBABILITY OF LOSS

We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the
    probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims
    and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be
    reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in
    determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable
    losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from
    the accrued amounts.

For additional information regarding claims and litigation
    including self-insurance, see Note 1 “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under
    the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.

INCOME
    TAXES

HOW WE DETERMINE
    OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

We file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns,
    including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries.
    We account for the current and deferred tax effects of such
    returns using the asset and liability method. Our current and
    deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best assessment
    of the estimated future taxes we will pay. Significant judgments
    and estimates are required in determining the current and
    deferred assets and liabilities. Annually, we compare the
    liabilities calculated for our federal, state and foreign income
    tax returns to the estimated liabilities calculated as part of
    the year end income tax provision. Any adjustments are reflected
    in our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
    the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
    represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in
    future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded
    the tax benefit in the income statement. At least quarterly, we
    assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will
    be recovered from future taxable income, and we will record a
    valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
    amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We take into
    account such factors as

§

prior earnings history

§

expected future taxable income

§

mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate

§

carryback and carryforward periods

§

tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of
    realizing a deferred tax asset

If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a
    portion of our deferred tax assets in the future for which there
    is currently no valuation allowance, we would charge an
    adjustment to the deferred tax assets to earnings. Conversely,
    if we were to determine that realization is more likely than not
    for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related
    valuation allowance would be reduced and we would record a
    benefit to earnings.

FOREIGN
    EARNINGS

U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when
    such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. We
    periodically evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign
    tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether
    foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and,
    accordingly, whether U.S. income taxes should be provided
    when such earnings are recorded.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX
    BENEFITS

We recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax
    position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that
    the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing
    authority. For a tax position that meets the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and
    subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that
    we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability
    associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted
    periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress
    of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging
    legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the
    period in which they are

Part
    II



identified. Our effective tax rate
    includes the net impact of changes in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as we
    consider appropriate.

Before a particular matter for which we have recorded a
    liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and
    finally resolved, a number of years may elapse. The number of
    years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is
    often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of
    resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable
    resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as
    a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the
    period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized
    tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax
    rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution.

We consider resolution for an issue to occur at the earlier of
    settlement of an examination, the expiration of the statute of
    limitations, or when the issue is “effectively
    settled,” as described in Accounting Standards Codification
    (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes. Our liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if
    we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain
    tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify
    interest and penalties recognized on the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

STATUTORY
    DEPLETION

Our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax
    rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory
    depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective
    tax rate is presented in Note 9 “Income Taxes” in
    Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.” The deduction for statutory depletion does not
    necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS

For a discussion of accounting standards recently adopted and
    pending adoption and the affect such accounting changes will
    have on our results of operations, financial position or
    liquidity, see Note 1 “Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies ‘” in Item 8 “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption New
    Accounting Standards.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain
    information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor
    created thereby. See the discussion in Safe Harbor Statement
    under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in
    Part I, above.

Part
    II



FINANCIAL TERMINOLOGY

CAPITAL
    EMPLOYED

The sum of interest-bearing debt, other noncurrent liabilities
    and shareholders’ equity. Average capital employed is a

12-month

average.

CAPITAL
    EXPENDITURES

Capital expenditures include capitalized replacements of and
    additions to property, plant & equipment, including
    capitalized leases, renewals and betterments. Capital
    expenditures exclude property, plant & equipment
    obtained by business acquisitions.

We classify our capital expenditures into three categories based
    on the predominant purpose of the project expenditures. Thus, a
    project is classified entirely as a replacement if that is the
    principal reason for making the expenditure even though the
    project may involve some cost-saving

and/or

capacity-improvement aspects. Likewise, a profit-adding project
    is classified entirely as such if the principal reason for
    making the expenditure is to add operating facilities at new
    locations (which occasionally replace facilities at old
    locations), to add product lines, to expand the capacity of
    existing facilities, to reduce costs, to increase mineral
    reserves, to improve products, etc.

Capital expenditures classified as environmental control do not
    reflect those expenditures for environmental control activities
    that are expensed currently, including industrial health
    programs. Such expenditures are made on a continuing basis and
    at significant levels. Frequently, profit-adding and major
    replacement projects also include expenditures for environmental
    control purposes.

NET
    SALES

Total customer revenues from continuing operations for our
    products and services excluding third-party delivery revenues,
    net of discounts and taxes, if any.

RATIO OF EARNINGS
    TO FIXED CHARGES

The sum of earnings from continuing operations before income
    taxes, minority interest in earnings of a consolidated
    subsidiary, amortization of capitalized interest and fixed
    charges net of interest capitalization credits, divided by fixed
    charges. Fixed charges are the sum of interest expense before
    capitalization credits, amortization of financing costs and
    one-third of rental expense.

TOTAL DEBT AS A
    PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL

The sum of short-term borrowings, current maturities and
    long-term debt, divided by total capital. Total capital is the
    sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

The sum of common stock (less the cost of common stock in
    treasury), capital in excess of par value, retained earnings and
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), as reported in
    the balance sheet. Average shareholders’ equity is a

12-month

average.

TOTAL SHAREHOLDER
    RETURN

Average annual rate of return using both stock price
    appreciation and quarterly dividend reinvestment. Stock price
    appreciation is based on a

point-to-point

calculation, using

end-of-year

data.

ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions
    that are entered into in the normal course of business. In order
    to manage or reduce these market risks, we may utilize
    derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
    purposes.

We are exposed to interest rate risk due to our various credit
    facilities and long-term debt instruments. At times, we use
    interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk.

In December 2007, we issued $325.0 million of

3-year

floating (variable) rate notes that bear interest at

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. Concurrently, we entered into an
    interest rate swap agreement in the stated (notional) amount of
    $325.0 million. This swap agreement terminated
    December 15, 2010, coinciding with the maturity of the

3-year

notes. The realized gains and losses upon settlement related to
    the swap agreement are reflected in interest expense concurrent
    with the hedged interest payments on the debt. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized liabilities,
    (included in other accrued liabilities), of $11.2 million
    and $16.2 million, respectively, equal to the fair value of
    this swap.

At December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value of our
    long-term debt instruments including current maturities was
    $2,564.3 million as compared to a book value of
    $2,432.8 million. The estimated fair value was determined
    by discounting expected future cash flows based on
    credit-adjusted interest rates on U.S. Treasury bills,
    notes or bonds, as appropriate. The fair value estimate is based
    on information available to management as of the measurement
    date. Although management is not aware of any factors that would
    significantly affect the estimated fair value amount, it has not
    been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date. The
    effect of a decline in interest rates of 1 percentage point
    would increase the fair market value of our liability by
    approximately $132.1 million.

At December 31, 2010, we had $450.0 million
    outstanding under our

5-year

syndicated term loan established in July 2010. These borrowings
    bear interest at variable rates — LIBOR plus a spread
    based on our long-term credit rating at the time of borrowing.
    An increase in LIBOR or a downgrade in our long-term credit
    rating would increase our borrowing costs for amounts
    outstanding under these arrangements.

We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of
    our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These
    economic risks include changes in the discount rate for
    high-quality bonds, the expected return on plan assets, the rate
    of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of
    increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.
    The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual
    pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in
    greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section
    of this annual report.

ITEM 8

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials
    Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements
    of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
    ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule in
    Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework,

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF
    OPERATIONS

Vulcan Materials Company (the “Company,”
    “Vulcan,” “we,” “our”), a New
    Jersey corporation, is the nation’s largest producer of
    construction aggregates, primarily crushed stone, sand and
    gravel; a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete
    and a leading producer of cement in Florida.

Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as presented in
    Note 2, the operating results of the Chemicals business are
    presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.

We disaggregated our asphalt mix and concrete operating segments
    for reporting purposes in 2010. See Note 15 for this
    discussion and additional disclosure regarding nature of
    operations.

PRINCIPLES OF
    CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Vulcan Materials Company and all our majority or wholly-owned
    subsidiary companies. All intercompany transactions and accounts
    have been eliminated in consolidation.

CASH
    EQUIVALENTS

We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities
    with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.
    The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value
    due to their short-term maturities.

MEDIUM-TERM
    INVESTMENTS

We held investments in money market and other money funds at The
    Reserve, an investment management company specializing in such
    funds, as follows: December 31, 2010 — $5,531,000
    and December 31, 2009 — $5,554,000. The
    substantial majority of our investment was held in The Reserve
    International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. On September 15, 2008,
    Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection.
    In the following days, The Reserve announced that it was closing
    all of its money funds, some of which owned Lehman Brothers
    securities, and was suspending redemptions from and purchases of
    its funds, including The Reserve International Liquidity Fund.
    As a result of the temporary suspension of redemptions and the
    uncertainty as to the timing of such redemptions, we changed the
    classification of our investments in The Reserve funds from cash
    and cash equivalents to medium-term investments and reduced the
    carrying value of our investment to its estimated fair value of
    $4,111,000 as of December 31, 2009. See the caption Fair
    Value Measurements under this Note 1 for further discussion
    of the fair value determination.

The Reserve redeemed our investment during the twelve months
    ended December 31, as follows: 2010 — $23,000 and
    2009 — $33,282,000, and $258,000 during the fourth
    quarter of 2008.

In January 2011, we received $3,630,000 from The Reserve
    representing the final redemption. As a result, we reclassified
    our investments in The Reserve funds from medium-term
    investments to cash and cash equivalents and reduced the
    carrying value to $3,630,000 as of December 31, 2010.

ACCOUNTS AND
    NOTES RECEIVABLE

Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our
    extending credit to trade customers for the purchase of our
    products. The terms generally provide for payment within
    30 days of being invoiced. On occasion, when necessary to
    conform to regional industry practices, we sell product under
    extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or
    unsecured short-term notes; or, on occasion, notes with
    durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing accounts
    receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from
    short-term transactions (less than one year) other

Part
    II



than the sale
    of our products, such as interest receivable; insurance claims;
    freight claims; tax refund claims; bid deposits or rents
    receivable. Receivables are aged and appropriate allowances for
    doubtful accounts and bad debt expense are recorded.

FINANCING
    RECEIVABLES

Financing receivables are included in accounts and notes
    receivable

and/or

investments and long-term receivables in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financing receivables are
    contractual rights to receive money on demand or on fixed or
    determinable dates. Trade receivables with normal credit terms
    are not considered financing receivables. We had $8,043,000 of
    financing receivables as of December 31, 2010. Our
    financing receivables consist primarily of a note receivable
    originating from a divested interest in an aggregates production
    facility and a note receivable from a charitable organization,
    both of which mature in four years. We evaluate the
    collectibility of financing receivables on a periodic basis or
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate we may be
    exposed to credit losses. As of December 31, 2010, no
    allowances were recorded for these receivables.

INVENTORIES

Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or
    market. We use the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories
    because it results in a better matching of costs with revenues.
    Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials,
    direct labor and production overhead. An actual valuation of
    inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of
    each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
    Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our
    estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and
    are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
    Substantially all operating supplies inventory is carried at
    average cost. For additional information regarding our
    inventories see Note 3.

PROPERTY,
    PLANT & EQUIPMENT

Property, plant & equipment are carried at cost less
    accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. The cost
    of properties held under capital leases, if any, is equal to the
    lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or
    the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the
    lease. For additional information regarding our property,
    plant & equipment see Note 4.

REPAIR AND
    MAINTENANCE

Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating
    expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments that add
    materially to the utility or useful lives of property,
    plant & equipment are capitalized and subsequently
    depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance
    activities, related primarily to periodic overhauls on our
    oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to the next
    overhaul.

DEPRECIATION,
    DEPLETION, ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method
    at rates based on the estimated service lives of the various
    classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (3 to
    30 years), buildings (10 to 20 years) and land
    improvements (7 to 20 years). Depreciation for our
    Newberry, Florida cement production facilities is computed by
    the

unit-of-production

method based on estimated output.

Cost depletion on depletable quarry land is computed by the

unit-of-production

method based on estimated recoverable units.

Accretion reflects the

period-to-period

increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset
    retirement obligations. It is computed using the same
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to initially measure the
    liability at fair value.

Amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization is
    computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets.
A significant portion of our intangible
    assets are contractual rights in place associated with zoning,
    permitting and other rights to access and extract aggregates
    reserves. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates
    reserves are amortized using the

unit-of-production

method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible
    assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of
    applicable lease terms or estimated useful life.

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS

We periodically use derivative instruments to reduce our
    exposure to interest rate risk, currency exchange risk or price
    fluctuations on commodity energy sources consistent with our
    risk management policies. We do not use derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Additional
    disclosures regarding our derivative instruments are presented
    in Note 5.

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation
    techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as
    described below:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities

Level 2:

Inputs that are derived principally
    from or corroborated by observable market data

Level 3:

Inputs that are unobservable and
    significant to the overall fair value measurement

Our assets and liabilities that are subject to fair value
    measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below:

The Rabbi Trust investments relate to funding for the executive
    nonqualified deferred compensation and excess benefit plans. The
    fair values of these investments are estimated using a market
    approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds and
    equity securities for which quoted prices in active markets are
    available. Investments in common/collective trust funds are
    stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying
    investments in those funds. The underlying investments are
    comprised of short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial
    paper, short-term bonds and treasury bills.

Part
    II



The medium-term investments are comprised of money market and
    other money funds, as more fully described previously in this
    Note under the caption Medium-term Investments. Using a market
    approach, we estimated the fair value of these funds by applying
    our historical distribution ratio to the liquidated value of
    investments in The Reserve funds. Additionally, we estimated a
    discount against our investment balances to allow for the risk
    that legal and accounting costs and pending or threatened claims
    and litigation against The Reserve and its management may reduce
    the principal available for distribution.

The interest rate derivative consists of an interest rate swap
    agreement applied to our $325,000,000

3-year

notes
    issued December 2007 and paid December 2010. This agreement is
    more fully described in Note 5. This interest rate swap is
    measured at fair value based on the prevailing market interest
    rate as of the measurement date.

The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash,
    accounts and notes receivable, current maturities of long-term
    debt, short-term borrowings, trade payables and other accrued
    expenses approximate their fair values because of the short-term
    nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for
    derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented
    in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

Our assets that are subject to fair value measurement on a
    nonrecurring basis are summarized below:

During 2010 we recorded a $3,936,000 loss on impairment of
    long-lived assets. We utilized an income approach to measure the
    fair value of the long-lived assets and determined that the
    carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value. The loss
    on impairment represents the difference between the carrying
    value and the fair value (less costs to sell for assets held for
    sale) of the impacted long-lived assets.

GOODWILL AND
    GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets
    acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the
    identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill
    impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is
    less than its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2010,
    goodwill totaled $3,097,016,000, as compared to $3,096,300,000
    at December 31, 2009. Total goodwill represents 37% of
    total assets at December 31, 2010, compared to 36% as of
    December 31, 2009.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, as of
    November 1, or more frequently whenever events or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
    Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level
    using a two-step process.

The first step of the impairment test identifies potential
    impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to
    its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a
    reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the
    reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of
    the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
    impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment
    loss, if any.

The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of
    that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
    by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting
    unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner
    consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair
    value representing implied goodwill. If the carrying value of
    the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We have four operating segments organized around our principal
    product lines: aggregates, concrete, asphalt mix and cement.
    Within these four operating segments, we have identified 13
    reporting units based primarily on geographic location. The
    carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning
    assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those

Part
    II



reporting
    units as of the measurement date. We estimate the fair values of
    the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values
    derived from both an income approach, which involves discounting
    estimated future cash flows, and a market approach, which
    involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of
    comparable companies. We consider market factors when
    determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation
    models. To substantiate the fair values derived from these
    valuations, we reconcile the reporting unit fair values to our
    market capitalization.

The results of the first step of the annual impairment tests
    performed as of November 1, 2010 and November 1, 2009
    indicated that the fair values of the reporting units with
    goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values.
    Accordingly, there were no charges for goodwill impairment in
    the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009.

The results of the annual impairment tests for 2008 indicated
    that the carrying value of our Cement reporting unit exceeded
    its fair value. Based on the results of the second step of the
    impairment test, we concluded that the entire amount of goodwill
    at this reporting unit was impaired, and we recorded a
    $252,664,000 pretax goodwill impairment charge for the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the
    use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable
    management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on
    assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such
    assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results
    may differ materially from those estimates. Changes in key
    assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting
    unit or its prospects, which may result from a change in market
    conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors
    outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative
    to historical or projected future operating results, could
    result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value
    of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment
    charge in the future.

For additional information regarding goodwill see Note 18.

IMPAIRMENT OF
    LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including
    intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. As of December 31, 2010, property,
    plant & equipment, net represents 44% of total assets,
    while other intangible assets, net represents 8% of total
    assets. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered
    impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such
    assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we
    recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value
    exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is
    determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology
    that requires considerable management judgment and long-term
    assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on
    historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which
    may be different from actual results. We periodically review the
    appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived
    assets.

During 2010 we recorded a $3,936,000 loss on impairment of
    long-lived assets. The loss on impairment was a result of the
    challenging construction environment which impacted certain
    non-strategic assets across multiple operating segments. We
    utilized an income approach to measure the fair value of the
    long-lived assets and determined that the carrying value of the
    assets exceeded the fair value. The loss on impairment
    represents the difference between the carrying value and the
    fair value of the impacted long-lived assets. There were no
    long-lived asset impairments during 2009 and the recorded
    long-lived asset impairments during 2008 were immaterial.

For additional information regarding long-lived assets and
    intangible assets see Notes 4 and 18.

REVENUE
    RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized at the time the sale price is fixed, the
    product’s title is transferred to the buyer and
    collectibility of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured.
    Total revenues include sales of products to customers, net of
    any discounts and taxes, and third-party delivery revenues
    billed to customers.

STRIPPING
    COSTS

In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and
    waste materials to access mineral deposits are referred to as
    stripping costs.

Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are
    considered costs of extracted minerals under our inventory
    costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in
    the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory.
    The production stage is deemed to begin when the activities,
    including removal of overburden and waste material that may
    contain incidental saleable material, required to access the
    saleable product are complete. Additionally, we capitalize such
    costs as inventory only to the extent inventory exists at the
    end of a reporting period. Stripping costs considered as
    production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced
    were $40,842,000 in 2010, $40,810,000 in 2009 and $59,946,000 in
    2008.

Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development
    stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are excluded from our
    inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized
    and reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production
    stripping costs are expensed over the productive life of the
    mine using the unit-of-production method. Pre-production
    stripping costs included in other noncurrent assets were
    $17,347,000 as of December 31, 2010 and $16,557,000 as of
    December 31, 2009.

OTHER
    COSTS

Costs are charged to earnings as incurred for the

start-up

of
    new plants and for normal recurring costs of mineral exploration
    and research and development. Research and development costs
    totaled $1,582,000 in 2010, $1,541,000 in 2009 and $1,546,000 in
    2008, and are included in selling, administrative and general
    expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and
    Comprehensive Income.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

We account for our share-based compensation awards using
    fair-value-based measurement methods. This results in the
    recognition of compensation expense for all share-based
    compensation awards, including stock options, based on their
    fair value as of the grant date. For awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006, compensation cost for all share-based
    compensation awards is recognized over the nominal (stated)
    vesting period. For awards granted subsequent to January 1,
    2006, compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service
    period.

We receive an income tax deduction for share-based compensation
    equal to the excess of the market value of our common stock on
    the date of exercise or issuance over the exercise price. Tax
    benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) are
    classified as financing cash flows. The $808,000, $2,072,000 and
    $11,209,000 in excess tax benefits classified as financing cash
    inflows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and

RECLAMATION
    COSTS

Reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long-lived
    assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only
    if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon
    retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs
    resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are
    recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal
    obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease.
    The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting
    cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the
    obligating event date and is accreted through charges to
    operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part
    of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated
    over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation
    is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability,
    a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.

To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the
    cost for a third party to perform the legally required
    reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This
    cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and
    an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years
    to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair
    value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted,
    risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to
    settlement.

In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts
    and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If
    this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement
    dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the
    probabilities of each alternative.

We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a
    revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement
    date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the
    period that a triggering event occurs that would result in
    either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated
    settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change
    in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an
    existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a
    change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition
    of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

The carrying value of these obligations is $162,730,000 as of
    December 31, 2010 and $167,757,000 as of December 31,
    2009. For additional information regarding reclamation
    obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset
    retirement obligations) see Note 17.

Part
    II



PENSION
    AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that
    we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of
    benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The
    primary assumptions are as follows:

§

DISCOUNT RATE — The discount rate is used in
    calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on
    projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.

§

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS — We project the future
    return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and
    our expectations for future returns for the types of investments
    held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset
    allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce the
    recorded net benefit costs.

§

RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE — For salary-related
    plans only, we project employees’ annual pay increases,
    which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at
    retirement.

§

RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE
    BENEFITS — We project the expected increases in the
    cost of covered healthcare benefits.

Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 715,
    “Compensation Retirement Benefits,”
    Sections 30–35 and 60–35 provide for the delayed
    recognition of differences between actual results and expected
    or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results
    allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in
    benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives
    of the employees who benefit under the plans. The differences
    between actual results and expected or estimated results are
    recognized in full in other comprehensive income. Amounts
    recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
    earnings in a systematic manner over the average remaining
    service period of active employees expected to receive benefits
    under the plan.

For additional information regarding pension and other
    postretirement benefits see Note 10.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    COMPLIANCE

Our environmental compliance costs include maintenance and
    operating costs for pollution control facilities, the cost of
    ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and
    other similar costs. We expense or capitalize environmental
    expenditures for current operations or for future revenues
    consistent with our capitalization policy. We expense
    expenditures for an existing condition caused by past operations
    that do not contribute to future revenues. We accrue costs for
    environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we
    determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably
    estimate the cost. At the early stages of a remediation effort,
    environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified
    due to the uncertainties of varying factors. The range of an
    estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as
    events in the remediation effort occur.

When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the
    most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of
    probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the
    range is accrued. As of December 31, 2010, the spread
    between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for
    all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was
    $4,634,000. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost
    estimations or the professional judgment of experienced
    environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental
    Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates,
    including key assumptions, for accruing environmental compliance
    costs; however, a number of factors, including adverse agency
    rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation
    efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially
    from accrued costs.

For additional information regarding environmental compliance
    costs see Note 8.

CLAIMS
    AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE

We are involved with claims and litigation, including items
    covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured
    for losses related to workers’ compensation up to
    $2,000,000 per occurrence and automotive and general/product
    liability up to $3,000,000 per occurrence. We have excess
    coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these deductible
    levels.

Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims
    and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on
    our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including
    future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain
    claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not
    included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and
    outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and
    establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a

Part
    II



probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For
    matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense
    costs are accrued when incurred. The following table outlines
    our liabilities at December 31 under our self-insurance program:

Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and
    amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual
    liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.

INCOME
    TAXES

We file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns,
    including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries.
    We account for the current and deferred tax effects of such
    returns using the asset and liability method. Our current and
    deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best assessment
    of the estimated future taxes we will pay. Significant judgments
    and estimates are required in determining the current and
    deferred assets and liabilities. Annually, we compare the
    liabilities calculated for our federal, state and foreign income
    tax returns to the estimated liabilities calculated as part of
    the year end income tax provision. Any adjustments are reflected
    in our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
    the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
    represent items to be used as a     tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have
    already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income
    statement. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that the
    deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable
    income, and we will record a valuation allowance to reduce our
    deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not
    to be realized. We take into account such factors as

§

prior earnings history

§

expected future taxable income

§

mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate

§

carryback and carryforward periods

Part
    II



§

tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of
    realization of a deferred tax asset

If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a
    portion of our deferred tax assets in the future for which there
    is currently no valuation allowance, we would charge an
    adjustment to the deferred tax assets to earnings. Conversely,
    if we were to make a determination that realization is more
    likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation
    allowance, the related valuation allowance would be reduced and
    we would record a benefit to earnings.

U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when
    such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. We
    periodically evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign
    tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether
    foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and,
    accordingly, whether U.S. income taxes should be provided
    when such earnings are recorded.

We recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax
    position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that
    the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing
    authority. For a tax position that meets the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and
    subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that
    we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability
    associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted
    periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress
    of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging
    legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the
    period in which they are identified. Our effective tax rate
    includes the net impact of changes in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as we
    consider appropriate.

Before a particular matter for which we have recorded a
    liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and
    finally resolved, a number of years may elapse. The number of
    years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is
    often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of
    resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable
    resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as
    a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the
    period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized
    tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax
    rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution.

We consider resolution for an issue to occur at the earlier of
    settlement of an examination, the expiration of the statute of
    limitations, or when the issue is “effectively
    settled,” as described in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented
    as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one
    year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is
    presented as current. We classify interest and penalties
    recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as
    income tax expense.

Our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax
    rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory
    depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective
    tax rate is presented in Note 9. The deduction for
    statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately
    to changes in pretax earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE
    INCOME

We report comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings and Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of
    Shareholders’ Equity. Comprehensive income includes charges
    and credits to equity
    from nonowner sources. Comprehensive income comprises two
    subsets: net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI
    includes fair value adjustments to cash flow hedges, actuarial
    gains or losses and prior service costs related to pension and
    postretirement benefit plans.

For additional information regarding comprehensive income see
    Note 14.

Part

EARNINGS PER
    SHARE (EPS)

We report two earnings per share numbers, basic and diluted.
    These are computed by dividing net earnings by the
    weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or
    weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution
    (diluted EPS), as set forth below:

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our

    equivalents are not included in our earnings per share
    calculations. Because we operated at a loss for the year 2010,
    415,000 shares that otherwise would have been included in
    our diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding
    computation for the year ended December 31, 2010, were
    excluded.

The number of antidilutive common stock equivalents for which
    the exercise price exceeds the weighted-average market price for
    the years ended December 31 is as follows:

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED

2010 — FINANCING RECEIVABLES DISCLOSURES As of and for
    the annual period ended December 31, 2010, we adopted
    Accounting Standard Update (ASU)

No. 2010-20,

“Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing
    Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses” (ASU

2010-20).

This standard requires new disclosures regarding the allowance
    for credit losses and the credit quality of an entity’s
    financing receivables. The requirements are intended to improve
    transparency of the nature of an entity’s credit risk
    associated with its financing receivables and how that risk
    impacts the allowance for credit losses. See the caption
    Financing Receivables under this Note 1 for these new
    disclosures. The adoption of ASU

2010-20

had
    no impact on our financial position, results of operations or
    liquidity.

2010 — ENHANCED DISCLOSURES FOR FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS As of and for the interim period ended
    March 31, 2010, we adopted ASU

No. 2010-6,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements”
    (ASU

2010-6)

as it relates to disclosures about transfers into and out of
    Level 1 and 2. Our adoption of this standard had no impact
    on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
    We will adopt ASU

2010-6

as it
    relates to separate disclosures about purchases, sales,
    issuances and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements
    as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2011.

2009 — RETIREMENT BENEFIT DISCLOSURES As of and for
    the annual period ended December 31, 2009, we adopted the
    disclosure standards for retirement benefits as codified in ASC
    Topic 715, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits”
    (formerly FSP FAS 132(R)-1), which requires more detailed
    disclosures about employers’ plan assets, including
    employers’ investment strategies, major categories of plan
    assets, concentrations of risk within plan
    assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
    of plan assets. As a result of our adoption of this standard, we
    enhanced our annual benefit plan disclosures as reflected in
    Note 10.

2009 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On January 1, 2009,
    we adopted business combination standards codified in ASC Topic
    805, “Business Combinations” (ASC 805) [formerly
    SFAS No. 141(R)], which requires the acquirer in a
    business combination to measure all assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair value.
    ASC 805 applies whenever an acquirer obtains control of one
    or more businesses. This standard requires prospective
    application for

Part
    II



business combinations consummated after
    adoption. Our adoption of this standard had no impact on our
    results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

2009 — DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    DISCLOSURES On January 1, 2009, we adopted disclosure
    standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
    codified in ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”
    (ASC 815) (formerly SFAS No. 161). As a result of our
    adoption of this standard, we enhanced our annual disclosure of
    derivative instruments and hedging activities as reflected in
    Note 5.

2009/2008 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT On January 1,
    2009, we adopted fair value measurement standards codified in
    ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures” (ASC 820) for nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value for accounting
    purposes, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On
    January 1, 2008, we adopted fair value measurement
    standards with respect to financial assets and liabilities and
    elected to defer our adoption of this standard for nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities. Our adoption of these standards did not
    materially affect our results of operations, financial position
    or liquidity.

See the caption Fair Value Measurements under this Note 1
    for disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities
    pursuant to the requirements of ASC 820.

2008 — RETIREMENT BENEFITS MEASUREMENT DATE On
    January 1, 2008, we adopted the measurement date provision
    of ASC Topic 715, “Compensation - Retirement
    Benefits” (ASC 715) (formerly SFAS No. 158). ASC
    715 requires an employer to measure the plan assets and benefit
    obligations as of the date of its year-end balance sheet. This
    requirement was effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2008. Upon adopting the measurement date
    provision, we remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations as
    of January 1, 2008. This remeasurement resulted in an
    increase to noncurrent assets of $15,011,000, an increase to
    noncurrent liabilities of $2,238,000, an increase to deferred
    tax liabilities of $5,104,000, a decrease to retained earnings
    of $1,312,000 and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of tax, of $8,981,000.

USE OF ESTIMATES
    IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
    and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate
    these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our
    estimates on historical experience, current conditions and
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the
    basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
    and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the
    accounting treatment with respect to commitments and
    contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from these
    estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain items previously reported in specific financial
    statement captions have been reclassified to conform with the
    2010 presentation.

NOTE 2:

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals
    business to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical
    Corporation. In addition to the initial cash proceeds, Basic
    Chemicals was required to make payments under two earn-out
    agreements subject to certain conditions. During 2007, we
    received the final payment under the ECU (electrochemical unit) earn-out, bringing
    cumulative cash receipts to its $150,000,000 cap.

Proceeds under the second earn-out agreement are based on the
    performance of the hydrochlorocarbon product HCC-240fa (commonly
    referred to as 5CP) from the closing of the transaction through
    December 31, 2012

(5CP earn-out

). The primary determinant of the value for this earn-out is the
    level of growth in 5CP sales volume. At the June 7, 2005
    closing date, the value assigned to the 5CP earn-out was limited
    to an amount that resulted in no gain on the sale of the
    business, as the gain was contingent in nature. A gain on
    disposal of the Chemicals business is recognized to the extent
    cumulative cash receipts under the 5CP earn-out exceed the
    initial value recorded.

Part
    II



During 2010, we received a payment of $8,794,000 (recorded as
    gain on disposal of discontinued operations) under the 5CP
    earn-out related to performance during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Any future payments received pursuant to
    the 5CP earn-out will be recorded as additional gain on disposal
    of discontinued operations. During 2009 and 2008, we received
    payments of $11,625,000 and $10,014,000, respectively, under the
    5CP earn- out related to the respective years ended
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Through
    December 31, 2010, we have received a total of $42,707,000
    under the 5CP earn-out, a total of $9,606,000 in excess of the
    receivable recorded on the date of disposition.

We are liable for a cash transaction bonus payable to certain
    former key Chemicals employees. This transaction bonus is
    payable if cash receipts realized from the two earn-out
    agreements described above exceed an established minimum
    threshold. The bonus is payable annually based on the prior
    year’s results. Payments for the transaction bonus were
    $882,000 during 2010, $521,000 during 2009 and $0 during 2008.

The financial results of the Chemicals business are classified
    as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for all periods
    presented. There were no net sales or revenues from discontinued
    operations for the years presented. Results from discontinued
    operations are as follows:

The 2010 pretax earnings from results of discontinued operations
    of $2,103,000 are due primarily to a $6,000,000 pretax gain
    recognized on recovery from an insurer in lawsuits involving
    perchloroethylene. This gain was offset in part by general and
    product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and
    environmental remediation costs associated with our former
    Chemicals business. The 2009 pretax earnings from results of
    discontinued operations relate primarily to settlements with two
    of our insurers in lawsuits involving perchloroethylene. These
    settlements resulted in pretax gains of $23,500,000. The
    insurance proceeds and associated gains represent a partial
    recovery of legal and settlement costs recognized in prior
    years. The 2008 pretax loss from discontinued operations and the
    remaining results from 2009 reflect charges primarily related to
    general and product liability costs, including legal defense
    costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our
    former Chemicals business.

In January 2011, we recovered an additional $7,500,000 from an
    insurer in lawsuits involving perchlorethylene. This recovery
    will be recorded as earnings from results of discontinued
    operations in the first quarter of 2011.

In addition to the inventory balances presented above, as of

    $16,786,000 and $21,091,000, respectively, of inventory
    classified as long-term assets (Other noncurrent assets) as we
    do not expect to sell the inventory within one year. Inventories
    valued under the LIFO method total $241,898,000 at
    December 31, 2010 and $252,494,000 at December 31,
    2009. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, inventory reductions resulted
    in liquidations of LIFO inventory layers carried at lower costs
    prevailing in prior years as compared to the cost of
    current-year

purchases. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on
    2010 results was to decrease cost of goods sold by $2,956,000
    and increase net earnings by $1,763,000. The effect of the LIFO
    liquidation on 2009 results was to decrease cost of goods sold
    by $3,839,000 and increase net earnings by $2,273,000. The
    effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2008 results was to decrease
    cost of goods sold by $2,654,000 and increase net earnings by
    $1,605,000.

Estimated current cost exceeded LIFO cost at December 31,
    2010 and 2009 by $123,623,000 and $129,424,000, respectively. We
    use the LIFO method of valuation for most of our inventories as
    it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. We
    provide supplemental income disclosures to facilitate
    comparisons with companies not on LIFO. The supplemental income
    calculation is derived by tax-effecting the change in the LIFO
    reserve for the periods presented. If all inventories valued at
    LIFO cost had been valued under the methods (substantially
    average cost) used prior to the adoption of the LIFO method, the
    approximate effect on net earnings would have been a decrease of
    $3,890,000 in 2010, an increase of $2,043,000 in 2009 and an
    increase of $26,192,000 in 2008.

NOTE 5:

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS

During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market
    risks including fluctuations in interest rates, fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates and changes in commodity
    pricing. From time to time, and consistent with our risk
    management policies, we use derivative instruments to hedge
    against these market risks. We do not utilize derivative
    instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The
    interest rate swap agreements described below were designated as
    cash flow hedges of future interest payments.

In December 2007, we issued $325,000,000 of

3-year

floating (variable) rate notes that bear interest at

3-month

London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.25% per annum.
    Concurrently, we entered into a

3-year

interest rate swap agreement in the stated (notional) amount of
    $325,000,000. Under this agreement, we paid a fixed interest
    rate of 5.25% and received

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. Concurrent with each quarterly
    interest payment, the portion of this swap related to that
    interest payment was settled and the associated realized gain or
    loss was recognized. This swap agreement terminated
    December 15, 2010, coinciding with the maturity of the

3-year

notes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, $12,075,000 of
    the pretax loss accumulated in OCI was reclassified to earnings
    in conjunction with the retirement of the related debt.

Additionally, during 2007, we entered into fifteen forward
    starting interest rate swap agreements for a total notional
    amount of $1,500,000,000. Upon the issuance of the related
    fixed-rate debt, we terminated and settled these forward
    starting swaps for cash payments of $89,777,000. Amounts
    accumulated in other comprehensive loss are being amortized to
    interest expense over the term of the related debt. For the

12-month

period ending December 31, 2011, we estimate that
    $8,201,000 of the pretax loss accumulated in OCI will be
    reclassified to earnings.

Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31,

We utilize our bank lines of credit as liquidity backup for
    outstanding commercial paper or draw on the bank lines to access
    LIBOR-based short-term loans to fund our borrowing requirements.
    Periodically, we issue commercial paper for general corporate
    purposes, including working capital requirements.

Our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least
    equal to our outstanding commercial paper. Unsecured bank lines
    of credit totaling $1,500,000,000 were maintained at the end of
    2010, all of which expire November 16, 2012. As of
    December 31, 2010, we had $285,500,000 of borrowings under
    the lines of credit. Interest rates referable to borrowings
    under these lines of credit are determined at the time of
    borrowing based on current market conditions. Pricing of bank
    loans was 30 basis points (0.30 percentage points)
    over LIBOR based on our long-term debt ratings at
    December 31, 2010. Bank loans totaled $285,500,000 as of
    December 31, 2010, of which $35,500,000 was borrowed on an
    overnight basis at 0.56%, $100,000,000 was borrowed for two
    months at 0.581% and $150,000,000 was borrowed for three months
    at 0.602%.

All lines of credit extended to us in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    based solely on a commitment fee; no compensating balances were
    required. In the normal course of business, we maintain balances
    for which we are credited with earnings allowances. To the
    extent the earnings allowances are not sufficient to fully
    compensate banks for the services they provide, we pay the fee
    equivalent for the differences.

As of December 31, 2010, $63,000 of our long-term debt,
    including current maturities, was secured. This secured debt was
    assumed with the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock. All
    other debt obligations, both short-term borrowings and long-term
    debt, are unsecured.

The estimated fair values of long-term debt presented in the
    table above were determined by discounting expected future cash
    flows based on credit-adjusted interest rates on
    U.S. Treasury bills, notes or bonds, as appropriate. The
    fair value estimates were based on information available to us
    as of the respective balance sheet dates. Although we are not
    aware of any factors that would significantly affect the
    estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been
    comprehensively revalued since those dates.

Scheduled debt payments during 2010 included $325,000,000 in
    December to retire the

3-year

floating notes issued in 2007, and payments under various
    miscellaneous notes that either matured at various dates or
    required monthly payments. Additionally, during 2010 we
    voluntarily prepaid $175,000,000 (the remaining balance) of our

3-year

syndicated term loan issued in 2008 ($100,000,000 in August and
    $75,000,000 in January), $15,000,000 of our private placement
    notes in August and $3,550,000 of our industrial revenue bonds
    in September. Scheduled debt payments during 2009 included
    $15,000,000 in March, June, September and December representing
    the quarterly payments under the

3-year

syndicated term loan issued in 2008, $250,000,000 in April to
    retire the 6.00%

10-year

notes issued in 1999, and payments under various miscellaneous
    notes that either matured at various dates or required monthly
    payments. Additionally, in November 2009 we voluntarily prepaid
    $50,000,000 of our

3-year

syndicated term loan issued in 2008.

Part
    II



In July 2010, we established a $450,000,000

5-year

syndicated term loan with a floating rate based on a spread over
    LIBOR (1, 2, 3 or

6-month

LIBOR options). The proceeds were used to repay outstanding
    borrowings, including the $100,000,000 outstanding balance of
    our

3-year

syndicated term loan issued in 2008 and all outstanding
    commercial paper, and for general corporate purposes. As of
    December 31, 2010, the spread was 2.25 percentage points
    (225 basis points) above the

3-month

LIBOR of 0.29% for a total rate of 2.54% on the $450,000,000
    outstanding balance. The spread is subject to increase if our
    long-term credit ratings are downgraded and is capped at
    2.5 percentage points. The loan requires quarterly
    principal payments of $10,000,000 starting in June 2013 and a
    final principal payment of $360,000,000 in July 2015.

In February 2009, we issued $400,000,000 of long-term notes in
    two related series, as follows: $150,000,000 of 10.125% coupon
    notes due December 2015 and $250,000,000 of 10.375% coupon notes
    due December 2018. These notes were issued principally to repay
    borrowings outstanding under our short- and long-term debt
    obligations. The notes are presented in the table above net of
    unamortized discounts from par. Discounts and debt issuance
    costs are being amortized using the effective interest method
    over the respective terms of the notes.

The 2008 and 2007 debt issuances described below relate
    primarily to funding the November 2007 acquisition of Florida
    Rock. These issuances effectively replaced a portion of the
    short-term borrowings we incurred to initially fund the cash
    portion of the acquisition.

In June 2008, we established a $300,000,000

3-year

syndicated term loan with a floating rate based on a spread over
    LIBOR (1, 2, 3 or

6-month

LIBOR options). This term loan was prepayable at par; therefore,
    in addition to the quarterly principal payments of $15,000,000
    for five quarters, we made prepayments of $50,000,000 in
    November 2009, $75,000,000 in January 2010 and paid the
    remaining $100,000,000 balance in August 2010.

Additionally, in June 2008 we issued $650,000,000 of long-term
    notes in two series, as follows: $250,000,000 of

5-year

6.30%
    coupon notes and $400,000,000 of

10-year

7.00% coupon notes. These notes are presented in the table above
    net of unamortized discounts from par. These discounts are being
    amortized using the effective interest method over the
    respective terms of the notes. The effective interest rates for
    these note issuances, including the effects of underwriting
    commissions and the settlement of the forward starting interest
    rate swap agreements (see Note 5), are 7.47% for the

5-year

notes
    and 7.86% for the

10-year

notes.

In December 2007, we issued $1,225,000,000 of long-term notes in
    four related series, as follows: $325,000,000 of

3-year

floating rate notes, $300,000,000 of

5-year

5.60%
    coupon notes, $350,000,000 of

10-year

6.40% coupon notes and $250,000,000 of

30-year

7.15% coupon notes. Concurrent with the issuance of the notes,
    we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on the
    $325,000,000

3-year

floating rate notes to convert them to a fixed interest rate of
    5.25%. These notes are presented in the table above net of
    unamortized discounts from par. These discounts and the debt
    issuance costs of the notes are being amortized using the
    effective interest method over the respective terms of the
    notes. The effective interest rates for these notes, including
    the effects of underwriting commissions and other debt issuance
    cost, the above mentioned interest rate swap agreement and the
    settlement of the forward starting interest rate swap agreements
    (see Note 5), are 5.41% for the

3-year

notes, 6.58% for the

5-year

notes, 7.39% for the

10-year

notes and 8.04% for the

30-year

notes.

In 1999, we purchased all the outstanding common shares of
    CalMat Co. The private placement notes were issued by CalMat in
    December 1996 in a series of four tranches at interest rates
    ranging from 7.19% to 7.66%. Principal payments on the notes
    began in December 2003 and were to have ended in December 2011.
    In August 2010, we voluntarily prepaid the remaining $15,000,000
    balance of these notes.

During 1991, we issued $81,000,000 of medium-term notes ranging
    in maturity from 3 to 30 years, and in interest rates from
    7.59% to 8.85%. The $21,000,000 in medium-term notes outstanding
    as of December 31, 2010 has a weighted-average maturity of
    4.2 years with a weighted-average interest rate of 8.85%.

The industrial revenue bonds were assumed in November 2007 with
    the acquisition of Florida Rock. These variable-rate tax-exempt
    bonds were to have matured as follows: $2,250,000 in June 2012,
    $1,300,000 in January 2021 and $14,000,000 in November 2022. The
    first two bond maturities were collateralized by certain
    property,
    plant & equipment and were prepaid in September 2010.
    The remaining $14,000,000 of bonds is backed by a letter of
    credit.

Other notes of $1,438,000 as of December 31, 2010 were
    issued at various times to acquire land or businesses or were
    assumed in business acquisitions.

Our determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is
    based on our judgment of various future events and
    uncertainties, including the timing, nature and amount of future
    income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of
    various plans to maximize the realization of deferred tax
    assets. We believe that the subsidiaries will generate
    sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax
    benefits. However, we do not believe that it is more likely than
    not that all of our state net operating loss carryforwards will
    be realized in future periods. At December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, we had deferred tax assets for state net
    operating loss carryforwards of $26,663,000 and $12,459,000,
    respectively, for which we have established valuation allowances
    of $20,721,000 and $10,768,000, respectively. The state net
    operating losses relate to jurisdictions with either

15-year

or

20-year

carryforward periods, and relate to losses generated in years
    from 2007 forward. As a result, the vast majority of the loss
    carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2022.

Part
    II



In 2010, we generated a deferred tax asset for a federal net
    operating loss carryforward of $25,629,000 which if left unused
    will expire in 2030. Additionally, at December 31, 2010 we
    had deferred tax assets of $8,324,000 for charitable
    contribution carryforwards and $22,816,000 for foreign tax
    carryforwards. The carryforward periods available for
    utilization for charitable contribution and foreign tax credit
    carryforwards are five years and ten years, respectively. Based
    on our analysis, we have concluded that it is more likely than
    not that each of these carryforwards will be utilized in their
    respective carryforward periods. As a result, no valuation
    allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets
    related to the federal net operating loss carryforward, the
    charitable contribution carryforwards or the foreign tax credit
    carryforwards.

As of December 31, 2010, income tax receivables of
    $39,529,000 are included in accounts and notes receivable in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. These receivables
    largely relate to prior year federal overpayments and net
    operating loss carrybacks. There were similar receivables of
    $25,702,000 as of December 31, 2009.

Uncertain tax positions and the resulting unrecognized income
    tax benefits are discussed in our accounting policy for income
    taxes (See Note 1, caption Income Taxes). The change in the
    unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended 2010, 2009
    and 2008 is reconciled below:

We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability
    for unrecognized income tax benefits as income tax expense.
    Interest and penalties recognized as income tax expense
    (benefit) were $1,525,000 in 2010, $472,000 in 2009 and
    ($202,000) in 2008. The balance of accrued interest and
    penalties included in our liability for unrecognized income tax
    benefits as of December 31 was $4,496,000 in 2010, $3,112,000 in
    2009 and $1,376,000 in 2008.

Our unrecognized income tax benefits at December 31 in the table
    above include $12,038,000 in 2010, $12,181,000 in 2009 and
    $12,724,000 in 2008 that would affect the effective tax rate if
    recognized.

We are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. The
    U.S. federal statutes of limitations for both 2007 and 2006
    were extended to December 31, 2011, with no anticipated
    significant tax increase or decrease to any single tax position
    expected. We anticipate no single tax position generating a
    significant increase or decrease in our liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this
    reporting date.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various
    state and foreign jurisdictions. Generally, we are not subject
    to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing
    jurisdiction for the years prior to 2006.

We have not recognized deferred income taxes on $52,138,000 of
    undistributed earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries
    because we consider such earnings as indefinitely reinvested. If
    we distribute the earnings in the form of dividends, the
    distribution would be subject to U.S. income taxes. In this
    event, the amount of deferred income taxes to be recognized is
    $18,248,000.

NOTE 10:

BENEFIT
    PLANS

PENSION
    PLANS

We sponsor three funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension
    plans. These plans cover substantially all employees hired prior
    to July 15, 2007, other than those covered by
    union-administered plans. Normal retirement age is 65, but the
    plans contain provisions for earlier retirement. Benefits for
    the Salaried Plan and a plan we assumed from Florida Rock are
    generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the
    Construction Materials Hourly Plan and the Chemicals Hourly Plan
    provide benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of
    service. Effective July 15, 2007, we amended our defined
    benefit pension plans and our then existing defined contribution
    401(k) plans to no longer accept new participants. Existing
    participants continue to accrue benefits under these plans.
    Salaried and non-union hourly employees hired on or after
    July 15, 2007 are eligible for a new single defined
    contribution

401(k)/Profit-Sharing

plan established on that date.

Additionally, we sponsor unfunded, nonqualified pension plans,
    including one such plan assumed in the Florida Rock acquisition.
    The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
    and fair value of assets for these plans were: $77,400,000,
    $72,000,000 and $0 at December 31, 2010 and $70,089,000,
    $63,220,000 and $0 at December 31, 2009. Approximately
    $9,000,000 and $8,700,000 of the obligations at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively,
    relate to existing Florida Rock retirees receiving benefits
    under the assumed plan.

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that
    will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
    into net periodic pension benefit cost during 2011 are
    $10,693,000 and $340,000, respectively.

Assumptions regarding our expected return on plan assets are
    based primarily on judgments made by us and our Board’s
    Finance and Pension Funds Committee. These judgments take into
    account the expectations of our pension plan consultants and
    actuaries and our investment advisors, and the opinions of
    market professionals. We base our expected return on long-term
    investment expectations. At December 31, 2010, the expected
    return on plan assets used to determine 2011 pension benefit
    cost was reduced to 8.00% from 8.25% to reflect the expected
    shift to higher fixed-income allocations.

Part
    II



We establish our pension investment policy by evaluating
    asset/liability studies periodically performed by our
    consultants. These studies estimate trade-offs between expected
    returns on our investments and the variability in anticipated
    cash contributions to fund our pension liabilities. Our policy
    accepts a relatively high level of variability in potential
    pension fund contributions in exchange for higher expected
    returns on our investments and lower expected future
    contributions.

Our current strategy for implementing this policy is to invest a
    relatively high proportion in publicly traded equities and
    moderate amounts in publicly traded debt and private, nonliquid
    opportunities, such as venture capital, commodities, buyout
    funds and mezzanine debt. The target allocation ranges for plan
    assets are as follows: equity securities — 50% to 77%;
    debt securities — 15% to 27%; specialty
    investments — 10% to 20%; and cash
    reserves — 0% to 5%. Equity securities include
    domestic investments and foreign equities in the Europe,
    Australia and Far East (EAFE) and International Finance
    Corporation (IFC) Emerging Market Indices. Debt securities
    include domestic debt instruments, while specialty
    investments include investments in venture capital, buyout
    funds, mezzanine debt private partnerships and an interest in a
    commodity index fund.

As of December 31, 2008, our Master Pension Trust had assets
    invested at Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (WCM) with a
    reported fair value of $59,245,000. In February 2009, the New
    York District Court appointed a receiver over WCM due to
    allegations of fraud and other violations of federal commodities
    and securities laws by principals of a WCM affiliate. In light
    of these allegations, we reassessed the fair value of our
    investments at WCM and recorded a $48,018,000 write-down in the
    estimated fair value of these assets for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. WCM assets of $11,227,000 at
    December 31, 2010 are included in the Equity funds asset
    category in the table above. All identifiable assets of WCM are
    currently held by a court-appointed receiver. During 2010, the
    court-appointed receiver released $6,555,000 as a partial
    distribution and the

Master Pension Trust received a $15,000,000
    insurance settlement related to our WCM loss. We intend to
    pursue all appropriate legal actions to recover additional
    amounts of our investments.

At each measurement date, we estimate the fair value of our
    pension assets using various valuation techniques. We utilize,
    to the extent available, quoted market prices in active markets
    or observable market inputs in estimating the fair value of our
    pension assets. When quoted market prices or observable market
    inputs are not available, we utilize valuation techniques that
    rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of our
    pension assets. The following describes the types of investments
    included in each asset category listed in the table above and
    the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair values as
    of December 31, 2010.

The debt securities category consists of bonds issued by
    U.S. federal, state and local governments, corporate debt
    securities, fixed income obligations issued by foreign
    governments, and asset-backed securities. The fair values of
    U.S. government and corporate debt securities are based on
    current market rates and credit spreads for debt securities with
    similar maturities. The fair values of debt securities issued by
    foreign governments are based on prices obtained from
    broker/dealers and international indices. The fair values of
    asset-backed securities are priced using prepayment speed and
    spread inputs that are sourced from the new issue market.

Investment funds consist of exchange traded and non-exchange
    traded funds. The bond funds asset category consists primarily
    of U.S. government and corporate debt securities. The
    commodity fund asset category consists of a single open-end
    commodity mutual fund. The equity funds asset category consists
    of index funds for domestic equities and an actively managed
    fund for international equities. The short-term funds asset
    category consists of a collective investment trust invested in
    highly liquid, short-term debt securities. For investment funds
    publicly traded on a national securities exchange, the fair
    value is based on quoted market prices. For investment funds not
    traded on an exchange, the total fair value of the underlying
    securities is used to determine the net asset value for each
    unit of the fund held by the pension fund. The estimated fair
    values of the underlying securities are generally valued based
    on quoted market prices. For securities without quoted market
    prices, other observable market inputs are utilized to determine
    the fair value.

The venture capital and partnerships asset category consists of
    various limited partnership funds, mezzanine debt funds and
    leveraged buyout funds. The fair value of these investments has
    been estimated based on methods employed by the general
    partners, including consideration of, among other things,
    reference to third-party transactions, valuations of comparable
    companies operating within the same or similar industry, the
    current economic and competitive environment, creditworthiness
    of the corporate issuer, as well as market prices for
    instruments with similar maturity, term, conditions and quality
    ratings. The use of different assumptions, applying different
    judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future
    market conditions could result in significantly different
    estimates of fair value of these securities.

    share) in March 2010 and an additional $1,300,000 in July 2010
    to our qualified pension plans for the 2009 plan year. These
    contributions, along with the existing funding credits, should
    be sufficient to cover expected required contributions to the
    qualified plans through 2012. In addition to the contributions
    to our qualified pension plans, we made $4,559,000 of benefit
    payments for our non-qualified plans during 2010 and expect to
    make payments of $5,028,000 during 2011 for our non-qualified
    plans.

Certain of our domestic hourly employees in unions are covered
    by multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Contributions
    to these plans approximated $6,842,000 in 2010, $6,991,000 in
    2009 and $8,008,000 in 2008. The
    actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits and net
    assets available for benefits for employees in the
    union-administered plans are not determinable from available
    information. As of December 31, 2010, a total of 16% of our
    domestic hourly labor force were covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. Of such employees covered by collective
    bargaining agreements, 9% were covered by agreements that expire
    in 2011. We also employ 245 union employees in Mexico, none of
    whom are participants in multi-employer pension plans.

In addition to the pension plans noted above, we had one
    unfunded supplemental retirement plan as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009. The accrued costs for the supplemental retirement
    plan were $1,381,000 at December 31, 2010 and $1,034,000 at
    December 31, 2009.

POSTRETIREMENT
    PLANS

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare
    and life insurance benefits for some retired employees.
    Effective July 15, 2007, we amended our salaried
    postretirement healthcare coverage to increase the eligibility
    age for early retirement coverage to age 62, unless certain
    grandfathering provisions were met. Substantially all our
    salaried employees and where applicable, hourly employees may
    become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying
    age and meet certain service requirements. Generally,
    Company-provided healthcare benefits terminate when covered
    individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become
    eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach
    age 65, whichever occurs first.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
    and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
    (collectively, Health Care Reform) were signed into law. We
    estimated the impact of Health Care Reform on our postretirement
    benefit obligations and reflected it in our December 31,
    2010 measurement. Subsequently, we applied and were approved for
    the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP). Due to the
    uncertain nature of ERRP, its impact was not reflected in our
    postretirement benefit obligations.

The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the
    plans and their reconciliation with the related amounts

PENSION AND OTHER
    POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ASSUMPTIONS

Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the
    expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation
    increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in
    the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.

In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income
    security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. We also
    analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for
    corresponding high-quality bonds. At December 31, 2010, the
    discount rates for our various plans ranged from 4.55% to 5.60%.

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider
    past performance and long-term future expectations for the types
    of investments held by the plan as well as the expected
    long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At
    December 31, 2010, we reduced the expected return on plan
    assets to 8.00% from 8.25%.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider
    past experience and future expectations. At December 31,
    2010, we increased our projected weighted-average rate of
    compensation increase to 3.50% from 3.40%.

Part
    II



In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and
    forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31,
    2010, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered healthcare benefits remained at 8.0% for 2011,
    decreasing each year until reaching 5.0% in 2017 and remaining
    level thereafter.

DEFINED
    CONTRIBUTION PLANS

We sponsor three defined contribution plans. Substantially all
    salaried and nonunion hourly employees are eligible to be
    covered by one of these plans. As stated above, effective
    July 15, 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans
    and our defined contribution 401(k) plans to no longer accept
    new participants. Existing participants continue to accrue
    benefits under these plans. Salaried and nonunion hourly
    employees hired on or after July 15, 2007 are eligible for
    a single defined contribution 401(k)/Profit-Sharing plan.
    Expense recognized in connection with these plans totaled
    $15,273,000 in 2010, $13,361,000 in 2009 and $16,930,000 in 2008.

NOTE 11:
    INCENTIVE PLANS

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Our 2006 Omnibus Long-term Incentive Plan (Plan) authorizes the
    granting of stock options, Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights
    (SOSARs) and other types of share-based awards to key salaried
    employees and non-employee directors. The maximum number of
    shares that may be issued under the Plan is 5,400,000.

DEFERRED STOCK UNITS — Deferred stock units were
    granted to executive officers and key employees from 2001
    through 2005. These awards vest ratably in years 6 through 10
    following the date of grant, accrue dividend equivalents
    starting one year after grant, carry no voting rights and become
    payable upon vesting. A single deferred stock unit entitles the
    recipient to one share of common stock upon vesting. Vesting is
    accelerated upon retirement at age 62 or older, death,
    disability or change of control as defined in the award
    agreement. Nonvested units are forfeited upon termination of
    employment for any other reason. Expense provisions referable to
    these awards amounted to $897,000 in 2010, $1,317,000 in 2009
    and $1,206,000 in 2008.

The fair value of deferred stock units is estimated as of the
    date of grant based on the market price of our stock on the
    grant date. The following table summarizes activity for
    nonvested deferred stock units during the year ended
    December 31, 2010:

PERFORMANCE SHARES — Each performance share unit is
    equal to and paid in one share of our common stock, but carries
    no voting or dividend rights. The number of units ultimately
    paid for performance share awards may range from 0% to 200% of
    target. For awards granted prior to 2010, 50% of the payment is
    based upon our

three-year-average

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the

three-year-average

TSR performance of the S&P

®

.

    The remaining 50% of the payment is based upon the achievement
    of established internal financial performance targets. For
    awards granted in 2010, the payment is based solely upon our
    relative

three-year-average

TSR performance. Performance share awards vest on December 31 of
    the third year after date of grant. Vesting is accelerated upon
    reaching retirement age, death, disability, or change of
    control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested units
    are forfeited upon termination for any other reason. Expense
    provisions referable to these awards amounted to $7,562,000 in
    2010, $5,350,000 in 2009, and $6,227,000 in 2008.

Part
    II



The fair value of performance shares is estimated as of the date
    of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation cost
    is adjusted for the actual outcome of the internal financial
    performance target. The following table summarizes the activity
    for nonvested performance share units during the year ended
    December 31, 2010:

During 2009 and 2008, the weighted-average grant date fair value
    of performance shares granted was $45.72 and $68.41,
    respectively.

STOCK OPTIONS/SOSARS — Stock options/SOSARs granted
    have an exercise price equal to the market value of our
    underlying common stock on the date of grant. With the
    exceptions of the stock option grants awarded in December 2005
    and January 2006, the options/SOSARs vest ratably over 3 or
    5 years and expire 10 years subsequent to the grant.
    The options awarded in December 2005 and January 2006 were fully
    vested on the date of grant and expire 10 years subsequent
    to the grant date. Vesting is accelerated upon reaching
    retirement age, death, disability, or change of control, all as
    defined in the award agreement. Nonvested awards are forfeited
    upon termination for any other reason. Prior to the acquisition
    of Florida Rock, shares issued upon the exercise of stock
    options were issued from treasury stock. Since that acquisition,
    these shares are issued from our authorized and unissued common
    stock.

The fair value of stock options/SOSARs is estimated as of the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    Compensation cost for stock options/SOSARs is based on this
    grant date fair value and is recognized for awards that
    ultimately vest. The following table presents the
    weighted-average fair value and the weighted-average assumptions
    used in estimating the fair value of grants for the years ended
    December 31:

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of

    approximating the option’s/SOSAR’s expected term. The dividend
    yield assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts.
    The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility
    and expectations about future volatility of our common stock
    over a period equal to the option’s/SOSAR’s expected
    term and the market-based implied volatility derived from
    options trading on our common stock. The expected term is based
    on historical experience and expectations about future exercises
    and represents the period of time that options/SOSARs granted
    are expected to be outstanding.

We provide certain third parties with irrevocable standby
    letters of credit in the normal course of business. We use
    commercial banks to issue such letters to back our obligations
    to pay or perform when required to do so according to the
    requirements of an underlying agreement. The standby letters of
    credit listed below are cancelable only at the option of the
    beneficiaries who are authorized to draw drafts on the issuing
    bank up to the face amount of the standby letter of credit in
    accordance with its terms. Our standby letters of credit as of
    December 31, 2010 are summarized in the table below:

Since banks consider letters of credit as contingent extensions
    of credit, we are required to pay a fee until they expire or are
    canceled. Substantially all our standby letters of credit have a
    one-year term and are renewable
    annually at the option of the beneficiary. Of the total
    $64,886,000 outstanding standby letters of credit as of
    December 31, 2010, $61,854,000 are backed by our
    $1,500,000,000 credit facility which expires November 16,
    2012.

As described in Note 2, we may be required to make cash
    payments in the form of a transaction bonus to certain key
    former Chemicals employees. The transaction bonus is contingent
    upon the amounts received under the two earn-out agreements
    entered into in connection with the sale of the Chemicals
    business. Amounts due are payable annually based on the prior
    year’s results. Based on the total cumulative receipts from
    the two earn-outs, we paid $882,000 in transaction bonuses
    during 2010. Future expense, if any, is dependent upon our
    receiving sufficient cash receipts under the remaining (5CP)
    earn-out and will be accrued in the period the earn-out income
    is recognized.

As described in Note 9, our liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits is $28,075,000 as of December 31, 2010.

We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders
    pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of
    the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise
    abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our
    continuing program of stewardship in safety, health and
    environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such
    proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material
    adverse effects on our business.

We have received notices from the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that
    we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a
    limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund)
    or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we
    share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or
    alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed
    allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the
    potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining
    any individual party’s share in that cost. As a result,
    estimates can change substantially as additional information
    becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site
    contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their
    probable level of involvement, and actions by or against
    governmental agencies or private parties.

We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at
    each Superfund site, as well as potential obligations arising
    under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While
    ultimate resolution and financial liability is uncertain at a
    number of the sites, in our opinion based on information
    currently available, the ultimate resolution of claims and
    assessments related to these sites will not have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a
    given period could be material to our results of operations or
    cash flows for that period. Amounts accrued for environmental
    matters are presented in Note 8.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of
    business. It is not possible to determine with precision the
    outcome of, or the amount of liability, if any, under these
    lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury
    trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.

In addition to these lawsuits in which we are involved in the
    ordinary course of business, certain other legal proceedings are
    specifically described below.

FLORIDA ANTITRUST LITIGATION — Our subsidiary, Florida
    Rock Industries, Inc., has been named as a defendant in a number
    of class action lawsuits filed in the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuits were
    filed by several ready-mixed concrete producers and construction
    companies against a number of concrete and cement producers and
    importers in Florida. There are now two consolidated amended
    complaints: (1) on behalf of direct independent ready-mixed
    concrete producers, and (2) on behalf of indirect users of
    ready-mixed concrete. The other defendants include Cemex Corp.,
    Prestige and Tarmac. The complaints allege various violations
    under the federal antitrust laws, including price fixing and
    market allocations. We have no reason to believe that Florida
    Rock is liable for any of the matters alleged in the complaint,
    and we intend to defend the case vigorously.

IDOT/JOLIET ROAD — In September 2001, we were named a
    defendant in a suit brought by the Illinois Department of
    Transportation (IDOT), in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
    Chancery Division, Illinois, alleging damage to a 0.9-mile section of Joliet Road that bisects our
    McCook quarry in McCook, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. On
    May 18, 2010, we settled this lawsuit for $40,000,000 and
    recognized the full settlement as a charge to operations in the
    second quarter of 2010. Under the terms of the settlement we
    paid IDOT $20,000,000 in May 2010 and we paid the second
    installment of $20,000,000 on February 17, 2011. We are
    taking appropriate actions, including participating in two
    arbitrations in 2011, to recover the settlement amount in excess
    of the self-insured retention of $2,000,000, as well as a
    portion of our defense costs from our

Part
    II



insurers. In February
    2011, we completed the first arbitration with two of our three
    insurers. The arbitration panel awarded us a total of
    $25,546,000 in payment of their share of the settlement amount
    and attorneys’ fees. This award will be recorded as income
    in the first quarter of 2011.

LOWER PASSAIC RIVER

CLEAN-UP —

We have been sued as a third-party defendant in

New Jersey
    Department of Environmental Protection, et al. v. Occidental
    Chemical Corporation, et al

., a case brought by the New
    Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in the New Jersey
    Superior Court. The third-party complaint was filed on
    February 4, 2009. This suit by the New Jersey Department of
    Environmental Protection seeks recovery of past and future

clean-up

costs as well as unspecified economic damages, punitive damages,
    penalties and a variety of other forms of relief arising from
    alleged discharges into the Passaic River of dioxin and other
    unspecified hazardous substances. Our former Chemicals Division
    operated a plant adjacent to the Passaic River and has been sued
    as a third-party defendant, along with approximately 300 other
    parties. Additionally, Vulcan and approximately 70 other
    companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order of
    Consent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to
    perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study of the
    contamination in the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River.
    This study is ongoing. At this time, we cannot determine the
    likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss pertaining to
    this matter.

PERCHLOROETHYLENE
    CASES

We are a defendant in cases involving perchloroethylene (perc),
    which was a product manufactured by our former Chemicals
    business. Perc is a cleaning solvent used in dry cleaning and
    other industrial applications. These cases involve various
    allegations of groundwater contamination or exposure to perc
    allegedly resulting in personal injury. Vulcan is vigorously
    defending all of these cases. At this time, we cannot determine
    the likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss pertaining
    to any of these matters, which are listed below:

§

CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE COMPANY — On June 6,
    2008, we were served in an action styled

California Water
    Service Company v. Dow, et al.

, now pending in the
    San Mateo County Superior Court, California. According to
    the complaint, California Water Service Company “owns

and/or

operates public drinking water systems, and supplies drinking
    water to hundreds of thousands of residents and businesses
    throughout California.” The complaint alleges that water
    systems in a number of communities have been contaminated with
    perc. The plaintiff is seeking compensatory damages and punitive
    damages. Discovery is ongoing.

§

CITY OF SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA — On January 6,
    2009, we were served in an action styled

City of
    Sunnyvale v. Legacy Vulcan Corporation, f/k/a Vulcan
    Materials Company

, filed in the San Mateo County
    Superior Court, California. The plaintiffs are seeking cost
    recovery and other damages for alleged environmental
    contamination from perc and its breakdown products at the
    Sunnyvale Town Center Redevelopment Project. Discovery is
    ongoing. A trial date of January 9, 2012 has been set.

§

SUFFOLK COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY — On May 4, 2010,
    we were served in an action styled

Suffolk County Water
    Authority v. The Dow Chemical Company, et al

., in the
    United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
    York. This case was subsequently dismissed and refiled in the
    Supreme Court for Suffolk County, State of New York. The
    complaint alleges that the plaintiff “owns

and/or

operates drinking water systems and supplies drinking water to
    thousands of residents and businesses, in Suffolk County, New
    York.” The complaint alleges that perc and its degradation
    products “have been and are contaminating and damaging
    Plaintiff’s drinking water supply wells.” The
    plaintiff is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.
    Discovery is ongoing.

§

UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS

Government of the United States;
    Department of Planning and Natural Resources; and Commissioner
    Robert Mathes, in his capacity as Trustee for the Natural
    Resources of the Territory of The United States Virgin
    Islands v. Vulcan Materials Company, et
    al

. This case has been
    dismissed, and we will not report on it further.

L’Henry, Inc., d/b/a
    O’Henry Cleaners and Cyril V. Francois, LLC v. Vulcan
    and Dow.

Plaintiffs are
    the owners of a dry cleaning business on St. Thomas. It was
    alleged that perc from the dry cleaner contributed to the
    contamination of the Tutu Wells aquifer, and that Vulcan, as a
    perc manufacturer, failed to properly warn the dry cleaner of
    the proper disposal method for perc, resulting in unspecified
    damages to the dry cleaner. This matter was settled in December
    2010 for an immaterial amount.

§

ADDAIR — This is a
    purported class action case for medical monitoring and personal
    injury damages styled

Addair et al. v. Processing
    Company, LLC, et al

., pending in the Circuit Court of
    Wyoming County, West Virginia. The plaintiffs allege

Part
    II



various
    personal injuries from exposure to perc used in coal sink labs.
    The perc manufacturing defendants, including Vulcan, have filed
    a motion for summary judgment. The Court has yet to rule on the
    motion but in the interim has stayed the litigation. As such,
    there has been no activity on this matter pending the
    Court’s ruling.

§

WEST VIRGINIA COAL SINK LAB
    LITIGATION — This is a mass tort action consisting of
    over 100 cases filed in 17 different counties in West
    Virginia from September 1 to October 13, 2010, for medical
    monitoring and personal injury damages for exposure to perc used
    in coal sink labs. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals,
    in an order entered January 19, 2011, transferred all of
    these cases (referred to as

Jeffrey Blount v. Arkema,
    Inc., et al.

) to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel.
    No discovery has been conducted in this matter.

§

SANTARSIERO — This is a
    case styled

Robert Santarsiero v. R.V. Davies,
    et al

., pending in Supreme Court, New York County,
    New York. The plaintiff alleges personal injury (kidney cancer)
    from exposure to perc. We were brought in as a third-party
    defendant by original defendant R.V. Davies. Discovery is
    ongoing.

§

R.R. STREET INDEMNITY —
    Street, a former distributor of perc manufactured by us, alleges
    that we owe Street, and its insurer (National Union), a defense
    and indemnity in several of these litigation matters, as well as
    some prior litigation which we have now settled. National Union
    alleges that we are obligated to contribute to National
    Union’s share of defense fees, costs and any indemnity
    payments made on Street’s behalf. We are having ongoing
    discussions with Street about the nature and extent of indemnity
    obligations, if any, and to date there has been no resolution of
    these issues.

It is not possible to predict with
    certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal
    proceedings in which we are involved and a number of factors,
    including developments in ongoing discovery or adverse rulings,
    could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued
    costs.  No liability was recorded
    for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be
    only reasonably possible or for which a loss could not be
    reasonably estimated. In addition, losses on certain claims and
    litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a
    per occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described in
    Note 1 under the caption Claims and Litigation Including
    Self-insurance.

NOTE 13:
    SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In March 2010, we issued 1,190,000 shares of common stock
    to our qualified pension plan (par value of $1 per share) as
    described in Note 10. This transaction increased
    shareholders’ equity by $53,864,000 (common stock
    $1,190,000 and capital in excess of par $52,674,000).

In June 2009, we completed a public offering of common stock
    (par value of $1 per share) resulting in the issuance of
    13,225,000 common shares at a price of $41.00 per share. The
    total number of shares issued through the offering included
    1,725,000 shares issued upon full exercise of the
    underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We
    received net proceeds of $519,993,000 (net of commissions and
    transaction costs of
    $22,232,000) from the sale of the shares. The net proceeds from
    the offering were used for debt reduction and general corporate
    purposes. The transaction increased shareholders’ equity by
    $519,993,000 (common stock $13,225,000 and capital in excess of
    par $506,768,000).

We periodically issue shares of common stock to the trustee of
    our 401(k) savings and retirement plan to satisfy the plan
    participants’ elections to invest in our common stock. The
    resulting cash proceeds provide a means of improving cash flow,
    increasing shareholders’ equity and reducing leverage.
    Under this arrangement, the stock issuances and resulting cash
    proceeds for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
    2010 — issued 882,131 shares for cash proceeds of
    $41,734,000; and 2009 — issued 1,135,510 shares
    for cash proceeds of $52,691,000.

During 2009 and 2008, we issued 789,495 and
    1,151,638 shares of common stock, respectively, in
    connection with business acquisitions.

There were no shares held in treasury as of December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 and no shares purchased during any of these
    three years. As of December 31, 2010, 3,411,416 shares
    may be repurchased under the current purchase authorization of
    our Board of Directors.

NOTE 15:
    SEGMENT REPORTING

We have four operating segments organized around our principal
    product lines: aggregates, concrete, asphalt mix and cement.
    Historically, we combined our Asphalt mix and Concrete operating
    segments into one reporting segment as the products are similar
    in nature and the businesses exhibited similar economic
    characteristics, production processes, types and classes of
    customer, methods of distribution and regulatory environments.
    In an effort to provide more meaningful information to the
    public, these two segments are now reported separately. We have
    recast our 2009 and 2008 data to reflect this change in
    reportable segments to conform to the current period’s
    presentation.

The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates and related
    products and services in all eight regional divisions. During
    2010, the Aggregates segment principally served markets in
    21 states and the District of Columbia, the Bahamas and
    Mexico with a full line of aggregates, and 3 additional states
    with railroad ballast. Customers use aggregates primarily in the
    construction and maintenance of highways, streets and other
    public works and in the construction of housing and commercial,
    industrial and other nonresidential facilities. Customers are
    served by truck, rail and water distribution networks from our
    production facilities and sales yards. Due to the high

weight-to-value

ratio of aggregates, markets generally are local in nature.
    Quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve
    remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be
    available. We sell a relatively small amount of construction
    aggregates outside the United States. Nondomestic net sales were
    $23,380,000 in 2010, $20,118,000 in 2009 and $25,295,000 in 2008.

The Concrete segment produces and sells ready-mixed concrete in
    five of our nine divisions serving nine states. Two of the
    divisions produce and sell other concrete products such as block
    and precast and resell purchased building materials related to
    the use of ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.

The Asphalt mix segment produces and sells asphalt mix in two of
    our nine divisions serving four states primarily in our
    southwestern and western markets.

Aggregates comprise approximately 78% of ready-mixed concrete by
    weight and 95% of asphalt mix by weight. Our Concrete and
    Asphalt mix segments are almost wholly supplied with their
    aggregates requirements from our Aggregates segment. These
    intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the
    particular grade and quality of product utilized in the
    production of ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix. Customers
    for our Concrete and Asphalt mix segments are generally served
    locally at our production facilities or by truck. Because
    ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly, delivery is
    time constrained and generally confined to a radius of
    approximately 20 to 25 miles from the producing facility.

The Cement segment produces and sells Portland and masonry
    cement in both bulk and bags from our Florida cement plant.
    Other Cement segment facilities in Florida import and export
    cement, clinker and slag and either resell, grind, blend, bag or
    reprocess those materials. This segment also includes a Florida
    facility that mines, produces and sells calcium products. All of
    these Cement segment facilities are within the Florida regional
    division. Our Concrete segment is the largest single customer of
    our Cement segment.

The vast majority of our activities are domestic. Long-lived
    assets outside the United States, which consist primarily of
    property, plant & equipment, were $150,157,000 in
    2010, $163,479,000 in 2009 and $175,275,000 in 2008.
    Transactions between our reportable segments are recorded at
    prices approximating market levels.

NOTE 17:

ASSET
    RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations
    associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting
    from the acquisition, construction, development

and/or

normal use of the underlying assets.

Recognition of a liability for an ARO is required in the period
    in which it is incurred at its estimated fair value. The
    associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the
    carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the
    estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted
    through charges to operating expenses. If the ARO is settled for
    other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a
    gain or loss on settlement.

We record all AROs for which we have legal obligations for land
    reclamation at estimated fair value. Essentially all these asset
    retirement obligations relate to our underlying land parcels,
    including both owned properties and mineral leases. For the
    years ended December 31, we recognized ARO operating costs
    related to accretion of the liabilities and depreciation of the
    assets as follows:

NOTE 18:
    GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We classify purchased intangible assets into three categories:
    (1) goodwill, (2) intangible assets with finite lives
    subject to amortization and (3) intangible assets with
    indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives are not amortized; rather, they are reviewed for
    impairment at least annually. For additional information
    regarding our policies on impairment reviews, see Note 1
    under the captions Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment, and
    Impairment of Long-lived Assets excluding Goodwill.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is recognized when the consideration paid for a
    business combination (acquisition) exceeds the fair value of the
    tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is
    allocated to reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill
    for impairment. There were no charges for goodwill impairment in
    the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

At December 31, 2008, ongoing disruptions in the credit and
    equity markets and weak levels of construction activity,
    underscored by the negative effects of the prolonged global
    recession, prompted an increase in our discount rates, which
    reflect our estimated cost of capital plus a risk premium. The
    results of our annual impairment test performed as of
    January 1, 2009 indicated that the estimated fair value of
    our Cement reporting unit was less than the carrying amount at
    that time. The estimated fair value was used in the second step
    of the impairment test as the purchase price in a hypothetical
    purchase price allocation to the reporting unit’s assets
    and liabilities. The carrying values of deferred taxes and
    certain long-term assets were adjusted to reflect their
    estimated fair values for purposes of the second step of the
    impairment test and the hypothetical purchase price allocation.

The residual amount of goodwill that resulted from this
    hypothetical purchase price allocation was compared to the
    recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit to determine
    if impairment existed. Based on the results of this analysis, we
    concluded that the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting
    unit was impaired and we recorded a $252,664,000
    ($227,581,000 net of tax benefit) noncash impairment charge
    for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The 2008 goodwill impairment charge is a noncash item and does
    not affect our operations, cash flow or liquidity. Our credit
    agreements and outstanding indebtedness were not impacted by
    this noncash impairment charge. The income tax benefit
    associated with this charge was substantially below our normally
    expected income tax rate because the majority of the goodwill
    impairment relates to goodwill nondeductible for federal income
    tax purposes.

Part

We have four reportable segments organized around our principal
    product lines: aggregates, concrete, asphalt mix and cement.

The goodwill of acquired businesses for 2010 relates to the
    2010 acquisitions listed in Note 19. We are currently
    evaluating the final purchase price allocation for most of these
    acquisitions; therefore, the goodwill amount is subject to
    change. All of the goodwill from the 2010 acquisitions is
    expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes.

INTANGIBLE
    ASSETS

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are stated
    at their fair value, determined as of the date of acquisition,
    less accumulated amortization, if applicable. Costs incurred to
    renew or extend the life of existing intangible assets are
    capitalized. These capitalized renewal/extension costs were
    immaterial for the years presented. These assets consist of
    contractual rights in place (primarily permitting and zoning
    rights), noncompetition agreements, favorable lease agreements,
    customer relationships and tradenames and trademarks. Intangible
    assets acquired individually or otherwise obtained outside a
    business combination consist primarily of permitting, permitting
    compliance and zoning rights and are stated at their historical
    cost, less accumulated amortization, if applicable.

Historically, we have acquired intangible assets with only
    finite lives. Amortization of intangible assets with finite
    lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a
    method of amortization that closely reflects the pattern in
    which the economic benefits are consumed or otherwise realized.
    Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment
    when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
    may not be recoverable. There were no charges for impairment of
    intangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008.

DIVESTITURES

    ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURE AND PENDING DIVESTITURE

In 2010, we acquired the following assets for approximately
    $70,534,000 (total cash consideration) net of acquired cash

§

twelve ready-mixed concrete facilities located in Georgia

§

one aggregates facility located in Tennessee

§

one aggregates facility located in California

The acquisition payments reported above include $5,000,000 of
    contingent consideration. Absent resolution of this contingency,
    we will receive reimbursement of this payment.

As a result of these 2010 acquisitions, we recognized $716,000
    of goodwill and $11,198,000 of amortizable intangible assets,
    all of which are expected to be fully deductible for income tax
    purposes. The amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of
    contractual rights in place and will be amortized using the

unit-of-production

method over an estimated weighted-average period of
    40 years. The purchase price allocations for these 2010
    acquisitions are preliminary and subject to adjustment.

In 2010, we divested the following assets for approximately
    $42,750,000 (total cash consideration)

§

three aggregates facilities located in rural Virginia

The pending divestiture of an aggregates production facility and
    ready-mixed concrete operation located outside the United States
    is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009 as assets held for sale and
    liabilities of assets held for sale. We expect a sale to occur
    during 2011. Depreciation expense and amortization expense were
    suspended on the assets classified as held for sale. The major
    classes of assets and liabilities of assets classified as held
    for sale for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

NOTE 20:
    CORRECTION OF PRIOR

PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENT

During 2010 we completed a comprehensive analysis of our
    deferred income tax balances and concluded that our deferred
    income tax liabilities were understated. The errors arose during
    2008 and during periods prior to January 1, 2007, and are
    not material to previously issued financial statements. As a
    result, we did not amend previously filed financial statements
    but have restated the affected balance sheet presented in this

Form 10-K.

The errors that arose during 2008 related to the calculations of
    deferred income taxes referable to the Florida Rock acquisition
    and additional 2008 federal return adjustments. The correction
    of these errors resulted in a decrease to deferred income tax
    liabilities of $6,129,000, and increase to goodwill referable to
    our Aggregates
    segment of $2,321,000 with an offsetting increase in current
    taxes payable of $8,450,000 for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

The errors that arose during periods prior to January 1,
    2007 resulted in an understatement of deferred income tax
    liabilities of $14,785,000. Based on the work performed to
    confirm the current and deferred income tax provisions recorded
    during 2007, 2008 and 2009, and to determine the correct
    deferred income tax account balances as of January 1, 2007,
    we were able to substantiate that the $14,785,000 understatement
    related to periods prior to January 1, 2007. The correction
    of these errors resulted in an increase to deferred income tax
    liabilities and a corresponding decrease to retained earnings of
    $14,785,000 as of January 1, 2007.

The errors did not impact earnings or cash flows for any years
    presented in our most recently filed 2009

Form 10-K.

A summary of the effects of the correction of these errors on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009, is

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE
    CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES

We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we
    file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s
    rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
    Rules 13a - 15(e) or 15d -15(e)), include, without
    limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, with the participation of other management officials,
    evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010.
    Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
    and procedures are effective.

We are in the process of replacing our legacy information
    technology systems. We completed the fifth phase of this
    multi-year project during the fourth quarter of 2010. The new
    information technology systems were a source for some
    information presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We are continuing to work toward the full implementation of the
    new information technology systems.

No other changes were made to our internal controls over
    financial reporting or other factors that could materially
    affect these controls during the fourth quarter of 2010.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting
    as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in
    Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design
    and effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of December 31, 2010.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as auditors of our consolidated
    financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010. Deloitte & Touche
    LLP’s report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
    follows this report.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM –

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vulcan Materials
    Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Vulcan Materials Company and its subsidiary companies (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

, issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions  of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010 based on the criteria established in

Internal Control

    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the

    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule of the Company as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and our report dated February 28,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
    statements.
