Part I

Item 1.

Business

As used in this

Form 10-K,

“MetLife,” the “Company,” “we,”
    “our” and “us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a
    Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”).

We are a leading provider of insurance and other financial
    services with operations throughout the United States and
    the regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Through
    our domestic and international subsidiaries and affiliates, we
    offer life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners
    insurance, retail banking and other financial services to
    individuals, as well as group insurance, reinsurance and
    retirement & savings products and services to
    corporations and other institutions.

We are one of the largest insurance and financial services
    companies in the United States. Our franchises and brand names
    uniquely position us to be the preeminent provider of protection
    and savings and investment products in the United States. In
    addition, our international operations are focused on markets
    where the demand for insurance and savings and investment
    products is expected to grow rapidly in the future.

Our well-recognized brand names, leading market positions,
    competitive and innovative product offerings and financial
    strength and expertise should help drive future growth and
    enhance shareholder value, building on a long history of
    fairness, honesty and integrity.

Over the course of the next several years, we will pursue the
    following specific strategies to achieve our goals:

•

Build on widely recognized brand names

•

Capitalize on a large customer base

•

Enhance capital efficiency

•

Expand distribution channels

•

Continue to introduce innovative and competitive products

•

Focus on international operations

•

Maintain balanced focus on asset accumulation and protection
    products

•

Manage operating expenses commensurate with revenue growth

•

Further commit to a diverse workplace

•

Capitalize on retirement income needs

We are organized into five operating segments: Institutional,
    Individual, Auto & Home, International and
    Reinsurance, as well as Corporate & Other. Revenues
    derived from any customer, or from any class of similar products
    or services, within each of these segments did not exceed 10% of
    consolidated revenues in any of the last three years. Financial
    information, including revenues, expenses, income and loss, and
    total assets by segment, is provided in Note 22 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from Citigroup
    Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”) for $12.1 billion.
    The results of Travelers’ operations were included in our
    financial statements beginning July 1, 2005. As a result of
    the acquisition, our management increased significantly the size
    and scale of our core insurance and annuity products and
    expanded our presence in both the retirement &
    savings’ domestic and international markets. The
    distribution agreements executed with Citigroup as part of the
    acquisition provide us with one of the broadest distribution
    networks in the industry. The consideration paid by the Holding
    Company for the acquisition consisted of $11.0 billion in
    cash and 22,436,617 shares of the Holding Company’s
    common stock with a market value of $1.0 billion to
    Citigroup and $100 million in other transaction costs. In
    addition to cash on-hand, the purchase price was financed
    through the



issuance of common stock, debt securities, common equity units
    and preferred stock. The acquisition was accounted for using the
    purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets
    and liabilities of Travelers be measured at their fair values as
    of July 1, 2005.

Institutional

Our Institutional segment offers a broad range of group
    insurance and retirement & savings products and
    services to corporations and other institutions and their
    respective employees. We have built a leading position in the
    U.S. group insurance market through long-standing
    relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in
    the United States.

Group insurance products and services include group life
    insurance, non-medical health insurance products and related
    administrative services, as well as other benefits and services,
    such as employer-sponsored auto and homeowners insurance
    provided through the Auto & Home segment and prepaid
    legal services plans. Non-medical health insurance is comprised
    of products such as accidental death and dismemberment
    (“AD&D”), long-term care (“LTC”),
    short- and long-term disability, individual disability income,
    critical illness and dental insurance. We offer group insurance
    products as employer-paid benefits or as voluntary benefits
    where all or a portion of the premiums are paid by the employee.
    Revenues applicable to these group insurance products and
    services were $14 billion and $13 billion, in 2007 and
    2006, respectively, representing 26% and 27% of our total
    revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Our retirement & savings products and services include
    an array of annuity and investment products, including defined
    contribution plans, guaranteed interest products and other
    stable value products, accumulation and income annuities, and
    separate account contracts for the investment management of
    defined benefit and defined contribution plan assets. Revenues
    applicable to our retirement & savings products were
    $8 billion and $7 billion in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, representing 15% of our total revenues in both
    2007 and 2006.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our Institutional segment markets our products and services
    through sales forces, comprised of MetLife employees, for both
    our group insurance and retirement & savings lines.

We distribute our group insurance products and services through
    a sales force that is segmented by the size of the target
    customer. Marketing representatives sell either directly to
    corporate and other institutional customers or through an
    intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. Voluntary products
    are sold through the same sales channels, as well as by
    specialists for these products. Employers have been emphasizing
    such voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our
    focus on communicating and marketing to such employees in order
    to further foster sales of those products. As of
    December 31, 2007, the group insurance sales channels had
    398 marketing representatives, which represented an increase of
    10% from 363 marketing representatives in the prior year.

Our retirement & savings organization markets
    retirement, savings, investment and payout annuity products and
    services to sponsors and advisors of benefit plans of all sizes.
    These products and services are offered to private and public
    pension plans, collective bargaining units, nonprofit
    organizations, recipients of structured settlements and the
    current and retired members of these and other institutions.

We distribute retirement & savings products and
    services through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers
    located in 15 offices around the country. In addition, the
    retirement & savings organization works with the
    distribution channels in the Individual segment and in the group
    insurance area to better reach and service customers, brokers,
    consultants and other intermediaries.

We have entered into several joint ventures and other
    arrangements with third parties to expand the marketing and
    distribution opportunities of institutional products and
    services. We also seek to sell our institutional products and
    services through sponsoring organizations and affinity groups.
    For example, we are the provider of LTC products for the
    National Long-Term Care Coalition, a group of some of the
    nation’s largest employers. In addition, the Company,
    together with John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation, is a
    provider for the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance program. The
    program, available to



most federal employees and their families, is the largest
    employer-sponsored LTC insurance program in the country based on
    the number of enrollees. In addition, we also provide life and
    dental coverage to federal employees.

Group
    Insurance Products and Services

Our group insurance products and services include:

Group life insurance products and
    services include group term life (both employer-paid basic life

    income benefits. These products and services are offered as
    standard products or may be tailored to meet specific customer
    needs. This category also includes specialized life insurance
    products designed specifically to provide solutions for
    non-qualified benefit and retiree benefit funding purposes.

Non-Medical Health.

Non-medical health
    insurance consists of short- and long-term disability,
    individual disability income, critical illness, LTC, dental and
    AD&D coverages. We also sell excess risk and administrative
    services-only arrangements to some employers.

Other Products and Services.

Other products
    and services include employer-sponsored auto and homeowners
    insurance provided through the Auto & Home segment and
    prepaid legal plans.

Guaranteed Interest and Stable Value
    Products.

We offer guaranteed interest contracts
    (“GICs”), including separate account GICs, funding
    agreements and similar products.

We also
    sell fixed and variable annuity products, generally in
    connection with the termination of pension plans or the funding
    of structured settlements. Annuity products include single
    premium buyouts, terminal funding contracts and structured
    settlement annuities.

Other Retirement & Savings Products and
    Services.

Other retirement & savings
    products and services include separate account contracts for the
    investment management of defined benefit and defined
    contribution plan assets on behalf of corporations and other
    institutions.

Individual

Our Individual segment offers a wide variety of protection and
    asset accumulation products aimed at serving the financial needs
    of our customers throughout their entire life cycle. Products
    offered by Individual include insurance products, such as
    traditional, variable and universal life insurance, and variable
    and fixed annuities. In addition, Individual sales
    representatives distribute disability insurance and LTC
    insurance products offered through the Institutional segment,
    investment products such as mutual funds, as well as other
    products offered by our other businesses. Individual’s
    principal distribution channels are the agency distribution
    group and the independent distribution group. Individual also
    distributes products through several additional distribution
    channels, including Walnut Street Securities, Inc. (“Walnut
    Street Securities”), MetLife Resources, Tower Square
    Securities, Inc. (“Tower Square Securities”) and Texas
    Life Insurance Company (“Texas Life”). In total,
    Individual had approximately 11,200 active sales representatives
    at December 31, 2007, which represented an increase of 2%
    from approximately 11,000 active sales representatives in the
    prior year.

Our broadly recognized brand names and strong distribution
    channels have allowed us to become the second largest provider
    of individual life insurance and annuities in the United States,
    with $18 billion of total statutory individual life and
    annuity premiums and deposits through September 30, 2007,
    the latest period for which OneSource, a database that
    aggregates United States insurance company statutory financial
    statements, is available. According to research performed by the
    Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association
    (“LIMRA”), based on sales through September 30,
    2007, we are the sixth largest issuer of individual variable
    life insurance in the United States and the ninth largest issuer
    of all individual life insurance products in the United States.
    In addition, according to research done by LIMRA and based on
    new annuity deposits through September 30, 2007, we are the
    second largest annuity writer in the United States.



During the period from 2003 to 2007, our first year statutory
    deposits for life products increased at a compound annual growth
    rate of approximately 6%. Life deposits represented
    approximately 32% and 33% of total statutory premiums and
    deposits for Individual in 2007 and 2006, respectively. During
    the period from 2003 to 2007, the statutory deposits for annuity
    products increased at a compound annual growth rate of
    approximately 10%. Annuity deposits represented approximately
    68% and 67% of total statutory premiums and deposits for
    Individual in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Individual had
    $15.6 billion and $14.5 billion of total revenues, or
    29% and 30% of our total revenues, in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our Individual segment targets the large middle-income market,
    as well as affluent individuals, owners of small businesses and
    executives of small- to medium-sized companies. We have been
    successful in selling our products in various multi-cultural
    markets. Individual products are distributed nationwide through
    multiple channels, with the primary distribution systems being
    the agency distribution group and the independent distribution
    group.

Agency Distribution Group.

The agency
    distribution group is comprised of two channels, the MetLife
    Distribution Channel, a career agency system, and the New
    England Financial Distribution Channel, a general agency system.

MetLife Distribution Channel.

The MetLife
    Distribution Channel had 6,243 agents under contract in
    98 agencies at December 31, 2007 as compared to 5,968
    agents under contract in 102 agencies at December 31, 2006.
    The career agency sales force focuses on the large middle-income
    and affluent markets, including multi-cultural markets. We
    support our efforts in multi-cultural markets through targeted
    advertising, specially trained agents and sales literature
    written in various languages. Multi-cultural markets represented
    36% and 35% of the MetLife Distribution Channel’s
    individual life sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    average face amount of a life insurance policy sold through the
    MetLife Distribution Channel was $349,000 in 2007 as compared to
    $313,000 in 2006.

Agents in the career agency system are full-time MetLife common
    law

and/or

statutory employees who are compensated primarily based upon
    sales in compliance with the limitations imposed by New York
    State Insurance Law Section 4228. These career agents are
    also eligible to receive certain benefits. Agents in the career
    agency system are not authorized to sell other insurers’
    products without our approval. At December 31, 2007, 93% of
    the agents in the career agency sales force were licensed to
    sell one or more of the following products: variable life
    insurance, variable annuities and mutual funds.

From 2006 through 2007, the number of agents under contract in
    the MetLife Distribution Channel’s career agency sales
    force increased from 5,968 to 6,243. The increase in the number
    of agents is due to improving retention which, in turn, drives
    increased productivity. From 2003 through 2007, the career
    agency system increased productivity, with net sales credits per
    agent, an industry measure for agent productivity, growing at a
    compound annual rate of 4%.

New England Financial Distribution
    Channel.

The New England Financial Distribution
    Channel targets high net worth individuals, owners of small
    businesses and executives of small- to medium-sized companies.
    The average face amount of a life insurance policy sold through
    the New England Financial Distribution Channel was $572,000 in
    2007 as compared to $561,000 in 2006.

At December 31, 2007, the New England Financial
    Distribution Channel included 46 general agencies providing
    support to 2,155 agents and a network of independent brokers
    throughout the United States. The compensation of agents who are
    independent contractors and general agents who have exclusive
    contracts with New England Financial is based on sales, although
    general agents are also provided with an allowance for benefits
    and other expenses. At December 31, 2007, 92% of New
    England Financial’s agents were licensed to sell one or
    more of the following products: variable life insurance,
    variable annuities and mutual funds.

Independent Distribution Group.

During 2005,
    the independent distribution group was expanded to include
    Travelers distribution, as well as General American Financial
    and the MetLife Investors Group. Within the independent
    distribution group there are three wholesaler organizations,
    including the coverage and point of sale



models for risk-based products, and the annuity wholesale model
    for accumulation-based products. Both the coverage and point of
    sale model wholesalers distribute universal life, variable
    universal life, traditional life, LTC and disability income
    products. The annuity model wholesalers distribute both fixed
    and variable deferred annuities, as well as income annuities. We
    intend to continue to grow existing distribution relationships
    and acquire new relationships in the coverage, point of sale and
    annuity channels by capitalizing on an experienced management
    team, leveraging the MetLife brand and resources, and developing
    high service, low cost operations while continuing the
    distribution of other MetLife products.

Coverage Model.

The coverage model wholesalers
    sell universal life, variable universal life, traditional life,
    LTC and disability insurance products and related financial
    services to high net worth individuals and small- to
    medium-sized businesses through independent general agencies,
    financial advisors, consultants, brokerage general agencies and
    other independent marketing organizations under contractual
    arrangements. These agencies and individuals are independent
    contractors who are generally responsible for the expenses of
    operating their agencies, including office and overhead
    expenses, and the recruiting, selection, contracting, training,
    and development of agents and brokers in their agencies. The
    wholesalers direct sales and recruiting efforts from a
    nationwide network of regional offices. As of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, the coverage model’s sales force included 16
    and 25 wholesalers, respectively.

Point of Sale Model.

The point of sale model
    wholesalers sell universal life, variable universal life,
    traditional life, LTC and disability income products through
    financial intermediaries, including regional broker-dealers,
    brokerage firms, financial planners and banks. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were 38 and 54 regional
    point of sale model wholesalers, respectively.

Annuity Model.

The annuity model wholesalers
    sell individual fixed and variable deferred annuities, as well
    as income annuity products through financial intermediaries,
    including regional broker-dealers, New York Stock Exchange
    (“NYSE”) brokerage firms, financial planners and
    banks. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were 127 and
    132 regional annuity model wholesalers, respectively.

Additional Distribution Channels.

The
    Individual segment also distributes our individual insurance and
    investment products through several additional affiliated
    distribution channels, including Walnut Street Securities, Tower
    Square Securities, Texas Life and MetLife Resources.

Walnut Street Securities.

Walnut Street

    MetLife, Inc., markets whole life and universal life insurance

    These brokers are independent contractors who sell insurance for
    Texas Life on a non-exclusive basis. A number of MetLife career
    agents also market Texas Life products. Texas Life sells
    universal life insurance policies with low cash values that are
    marketed through the use of brochures, as well as payroll
    deduction life insurance products.

Products

We offer a wide variety of individual insurance, as well as
    annuities and investment-type products, aimed at serving our
    customers’ financial needs throughout their entire life
    cycle.



Insurance
    Products

Our individual insurance products include variable life
    products, universal life products, traditional life products,
    including whole life and term life, and other individual
    products, including individual disability and LTC insurance.

We continually review and update our products. We have
    introduced new products and features designed to increase the
    competitiveness of our portfolio and the flexibility of our
    products to meet the broad range of asset accumulation,
    life-cycle protection and distribution needs of our customers.

Variable Life.

Variable life products provide
    insurance coverage through a contract that gives the
    policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on
    the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with
    certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life
    products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the
    policyholder into a variety of separate accounts or directed to
    the Company’s general account. In the separate accounts,
    the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment
    results. We collect specified fees for the management of these
    various investment accounts and any net return is credited
    directly to the policyholder’s account. In some instances,
    third-party money management firms manage investment accounts
    that support variable insurance products. With some products, by
    maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the
    advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death
    benefit from adverse investment experience.

Universal Life.

Universal life products
    provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life,
    except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances,
    are allocated only to the Company’s general account.
    Universal life products may allow the insured to increase or
    decrease the amount of death benefit coverage over the term of
    the contract and the owner to adjust the frequency and amount of
    premium payments. We credit premiums to an account maintained
    for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified
    expenses and interest, at interest rates we determine, subject
    to specified minimums. Specific charges are made against the
    policyholder’s account for the cost of insurance protection
    and for expenses. With some products, by maintaining a certain
    premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various
    guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse
    investment experience.

Whole Life.

Whole life products provide a
    guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for
    the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined
    period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of
    the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be
    level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule.
    Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a
    participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders
    may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death
    benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or
    reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.
    Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder,
    this group of products provides significant flexibility to
    individuals to tailor the product to suit their specific needs
    and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed
    benefits.

Term Life.

Term life provides a guaranteed
    benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time
    period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Specified
    coverage periods range from one year to 20 years, but in no
    event are they longer than the period over which premiums are
    paid. Death benefits may be level over the period or decreasing.
    Decreasing coverage is used principally to provide for loan
    repayment in the event of death. Premiums may be guaranteed at a
    level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and
    non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are sometimes referred
    to as pure protection products, in that there are typically no
    savings or investment elements. Term contracts expire without
    value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party
    is still living.

Other Individual Products.

Individual
    disability products provide a benefit in the event of the
    disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in
    the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches
    age 65. In addition to income replacement, the product may
    be used to provide for the payment of business overhead expenses
    for disabled business owners or mortgage payment protection.

Our LTC insurance provides a fixed benefit for certain costs
    associated with nursing home care and other services that may be
    provided to individuals unable to perform certain activities of
    daily living.



In addition to these products, our Individual segment supports a
    group of low face amount life insurance policies, known as
    industrial policies, that its agents sold until 1964.

Annuities
    and Investment Products

We offer a variety of individual annuities and investment
    products, including variable and fixed annuities, and mutual
    funds and securities.

Variable Annuities.

We offer variable
    annuities for both asset accumulation and asset distribution
    needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make
    deposits into various investment accounts, as determined by the
    contractholder. The investment accounts are separate accounts
    and risks associated with such investments are borne entirely by
    the contractholder. In certain variable annuity products,
    contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of
    their account to the Company’s general account and are
    credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain
    minimums. In addition, contractholders may also elect certain
    minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for
    which additional fees are charged.

Fixed Annuities.

Fixed annuities are used for
    both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed
    annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided
    by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the
    preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made
    into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the
    Company’s general account and are credited with interest at
    rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. Credited
    interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited
    periods of time, ranging from one to ten years. Fixed income
    annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified
    period of years

and/or

for
    the life of the annuitant.

Mutual Funds and Securities.

Through our
    broker-dealer affiliates, we offer a full range of mutual funds
    and other securities products.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home, operating through Metropolitan Property
    and Casualty Insurance Company and its subsidiaries
    (“MPC”), offers personal lines property and casualty
    insurance directly to employees at their employer’s
    worksite, as well as to individuals through a variety of retail
    distribution channels, including the agency distribution group,
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists and direct
    response marketing. Auto & Home primarily sells auto
    insurance, which represented 71% of Auto & Home’s
    total net earned premiums in 2007, and homeowners and other
    insurance, which represented 29% of Auto & Home’s
    total net earned premiums in 2007.

Products

Auto & Home’s insurance products include auto,
    homeowners, renters, condominium and dwelling, and other
    personal lines.

Auto Coverages.

Auto insurance policies
    include coverages for private passenger automobiles, utility
    automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or
    classic automobiles and trailers. Auto & Home offers
    traditional coverages such as liability, uninsured motorist, no
    fault or personal injury protection and collision and
    comprehensive.

Homeowners and Other Coverages.

Homeowners
    insurance provides protection for homeowners, renters,
    condominium owners and residential landlords against losses
    arising out of damage to dwellings and contents from a wide
    variety of perils, as well as coverage for liability arising
    from ownership or occupancy. Other insurance includes personal
    excess liability (protection against losses in excess of amounts
    covered by other liability insurance policies), and coverages
    for recreational vehicles and boat owners.

Traditional insurance policies for dwellings represent the
    majority of Auto & Home’s homeowners policies
    providing protection for loss on a “replacement cost”
    basis. These policies provide additional coverage for
    reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by policyholders
    that have been displaced from their homes.



Marketing
    and Distribution

Personal lines auto and homeowners insurance products are
    directly marketed to employees at their employer’s
    worksite. Auto & Home products are also marketed and
    sold to individuals by the agency distribution group,
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists and
    through a direct response channel.

Employer
    Worksite Programs

Auto & Home is a leading provider of auto and
    homeowners products offered to employees at their
    employer’s worksite. Net earned premiums increased by
    $27 million, or 3%, to $1.0 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year. At
    December 31, 2007, approximately 2,100 employers offered
    MetLife Auto & Home products to their employees.

Institutional marketing representatives market the
    Auto & Home program to employers through a variety of
    means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to MetLife
    group customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife
    commences marketing efforts to employees. Employees who are
    interested in the auto and homeowners products can call a
    toll-free number to request a quote, to purchase coverage and to
    request payroll deduction over the telephone. Auto &
    Home has also developed proprietary software that permits an
    employee in most states to obtain a quote for auto insurance
    through Auto & Home’s Internet website.

Retail
    Distribution Channels

We market and sell Auto & Home products through the
    agency distribution group, independent agents, property and
    casualty specialists and through a direct response channel. In
    recent years, we have increased the number of agency
    distribution group career agents and independent agents
    appointed to sell these products.

Agency Distribution Group Career Agency
    System.

The agency distribution group career
    agency system had approximately 1,720 agents at
    December 31, 2007, that sold Auto & Home
    insurance products, representing an 8% increase from 1,600
    agents in the prior year.

Independent Agencies.

At December 31,
    2007, Auto & Home maintained contracts with more than
    4,500 agencies and brokers, representing a 5% increase of 200
    agencies.

Property and Casualty Specialists.

At
    December 31, 2007, Auto & Home had 600
    specialists located in 37 states as compared to 648
    specialists located in 35 states in the prior year.
    Auto & Home’s strategy is to utilize property and
    casualty specialists, who are Auto & Home employees,
    in geographic markets that are underserved by MetLife career
    agents.

Other Distribution Channels.

Auto &
    Home also utilizes a direct response marketing channel which
    permits sales to be generated through sources such as target
    mailings, career agent referrals and the Internet.

In 2007, Auto & Home’s business was concentrated
    in the following states, as measured by net earned premiums: New
    York $375 million, or 12.7%; Massachusetts
    $340 million, or 11.5%; Illinois $202 million, or
    6.8%; Florida $196 million, or 6.6%; Connecticut
    $138 million, or 4.6%; and Minnesota $114 million, or
    3.8%.

Claims

At December 31, 2007, Auto & Home’s claims
    department included approximately 2,000 employees located
    in Auto & Home’s Warwick, Rhode Island home
    office, 11 field claim offices, 6 in-house counsel offices,
    drive-in inspection sites and other sites throughout the United
    States. These employees included claim adjusters, appraisers,
    attorneys, managers, medical specialists, investigators,
    customer service representatives, claim financial analysts and
    support staff. Claim adjusters, representing the majority of
    employees, investigate, evaluate and settle over 675,000 claims
    annually, principally by telephone.

International

International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, credit insurance, annuities and
    retirement & savings products to both individuals and
    groups. We focus on emerging markets primarily within



the Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. We operate
    in international markets through subsidiaries and joint
    ventures. The acquisition of Travelers in 2005 added operations
    in the following markets: Australia, Belgium, Japan, Poland and
    the United Kingdom; as well as in markets in which we had
    already operated: Argentina, Brazil, Hong Kong, India and China.
    See “Risk Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities Markets Could
    Negatively Affect Our Profitability,” and “Risk
    Factors — Our International Operations Face Political,
    Legal, Operational and Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect
    Those Operations or Our Profitability,” and
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Latin
    America

We operate in the Latin America region in the following
    countries: Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The
    operations in Mexico, Chile and Argentina represented 88% of the
    total premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The Mexican operation is the largest
    life insurance company in both the individual and group
    businesses in Mexico. The Chilean operation is the third largest
    annuity company in Chile, based on market share. The Chilean
    operation also offers individual life insurance and group
    insurance products. The Argentinean operation is the second
    largest pension company in the market, based on employee
    contributions. The Argentinean operation actively markets
    individual life insurance, group insurance products and credit
    life coverage.

Europe

We operate in Europe in the following countries: the United
    Kingdom, Belgium, Poland and Ireland. The results of our
    operation in India are also included in this region. The
    operation in the United Kingdom represented 56% of the total
    premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The United Kingdom operation underwrites
    risk in its home market and 14 other countries across Europe,
    offering credit insurance and personal accident coverage.

Asia
    Pacific

We operate in the Asia Pacific region in the following
    countries: South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and
    China. The operations in South Korea and Taiwan represented 78%
    of the total premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The South Korean operation offers
    individual life insurance, annuities, retirement &
    savings and non-medical health products, as well as group
    retirement products. The Taiwanese operation offers individual
    life, accident and health, personal travel insurance products
    and annuities, as well as group life and group accident and
    health insurance products. In 2007, we completed the sale of our
    Australia annuities and pension businesses to a third party. The
    Japanese operation offers fixed and guaranteed variable
    annuities and variable life products. The Japanese operation is
    not included in total premiums and fees but is included as a
    component of our net investment income. Also in 2007, we
    acquired the remaining 50% interest in a joint venture in Hong
    Kong resulting in the joint venture becoming a consolidated
    subsidiary.

Reinsurance

Our Reinsurance segment is comprised of the life reinsurance
    business of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated
    (“RGA”), a publicly traded company (NYSE: RGA). At
    December 31, 2007, our ownership in RGA was approximately
    52%.

RGA’s operations in North America are its largest and
    include operations of its Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries.
    In addition to these operations, RGA has subsidiary companies,
    branch offices, or representative offices in Australia,
    Barbados, Bermuda, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India,
    Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, South
    Korea, Spain, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

In addition to its life reinsurance business, RGA provides
    reinsurance of asset-intensive products, critical illness and
    financial reinsurance. RGA and its predecessor, the reinsurance
    division of General American Life Insurance Company
    (“GALIC”), have been engaged in the business of life
    reinsurance since 1973. As of December 31, 2007, RGA had
    $22 billion and $2.1 trillion in consolidated assets and
    worldwide life reinsurance in-force, respectively.



RGA’s
    Products and Services

RGA’s operational segments are segregated primarily by
    geographic region: United States, Canada, Asia Pacific and
    Europe & South Africa, as well as
    Corporate & Other. The U.S. operations, which
    represented 59% of RGA’s 2007 net premiums, provide
    traditional life, asset-intensive products and financial
    reinsurance to domestic clients. Traditional life reinsurance
    involves RGA indemnifying another insurance company for all or a
    portion of the insurance risk, primarily mortality risk, it has
    written. Asset-intensive products primarily include the
    reinsurance of corporate-owned life insurance and annuities.
    Financial reinsurance involves assisting RGA’s clients
    (other insurance companies) in managing their regulatory capital
    or in achieving other financial goals. The Canadian operations,
    which represented 10% of RGA’s 2007 net premiums,
    primarily provide insurers with traditional life reinsurance.
    The Asia Pacific and Europe & South Africa operations,
    which represented, collectively, 31% of RGA’s 2007 net
    premiums, provide primarily traditional life and critical
    illness reinsurance and, to a lesser extent, financial
    reinsurance. Traditional life reinsurance pays upon the death of
    the insured and critical illness coverage provides a benefit
    upon the diagnosis of a pre-defined illness.

Corporate &
    Other

Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not
    allocated to the business segments, various

start-up

entities, including MetLife Bank, National Association
    (“MetLife Bank” or “MetLife Bank, N.A.”), a
    national bank, and run-off entities, as well as interest expense
    related to the majority of our outstanding debt and expenses
    associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit
    issues. Corporate & Other also includes the
    elimination of all intersegment amounts, which generally relate
    to intersegment loans, which bear interest rates commensurate
    with related borrowings, as well as intersegment transactions.

Policyholder
    Liabilities

We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined
    amounts that are calculated to meet our policy obligations when
    a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes
    disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to
    provide for future annuity payments. We compute the amounts for
    actuarial liabilities reported in our consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

In establishing actuarial liabilities for life and non-medical
    health insurance policies and annuity contracts, we distinguish
    between short duration and long duration contracts. Short
    duration contracts generally relate to group term life,
    non-medical health and property and casualty insurance. Long
    duration contracts primarily consist of traditional whole life,
    guaranteed renewable term life, universal life, annuities,
    individual disability income and LTC.

The actuarial liability for short duration contracts consists of
    gross unearned premiums, the amount of the payments on pending
    and approved claims, and the amount of incurred but not reported
    claims as of the valuation date. We determine actuarial
    liabilities for long duration contracts using assumptions based
    on experience, plus a margin for adverse deviation for these
    policies.

The liability for future policy benefits for participating
    traditional life insurance is the net level reserve using the
    policy’s guaranteed mortality rates and the dividend fund
    interest rate or nonforfeiture interest rate, as applicable.

Actuarial liabilities for term life, non-participating whole
    life, individual disability income, LTC and limited pay
    contracts, such as single premium immediate individual
    annuities, structured settlement annuities and certain group
    pension annuities are equal to the present value of future
    benefit payments and related expenses less the present value of
    future net premiums plus premium deficiency reserves, if any.
    For limited pay contracts, we also defer the excess of the gross
    premium over the net premium and recognize such excess into
    income in a constant relationship with insurance in-force for
    life insurance contracts and in relation to anticipated future
    benefit payments for annuity contracts.

We also establish actuarial liabilities for future policy
    benefits (associated with base policies and riders, unearned
    mortality charges and future disability benefits), for other
    policyholder liabilities (associated with



unearned revenues and claims payable) and for unearned revenue
    (the unamortized portion of front-end loads charged). We also
    establish liabilities for minimum benefit guarantees relating to
    certain annuity contracts and secondary and

paid-up

guarantees relating to certain life policies.

Liabilities for investment-type and universal life-type products
    primarily consist of policyholder account balances.
    Investment-type products include individual annuity contracts in
    the accumulation phase and certain group pension contracts that
    have limited or no mortality risk. Universal life-type products
    consist of universal and variable life contracts and contain
    group pension contracts. For universal life-type contracts with
    front-end loads, we defer the charge and amortize the unearned
    revenue using the product’s estimated gross profits.

The Auto & Home segment establishes actuarial
    liabilities to account for the estimated ultimate costs of
    losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been
    reported but not yet settled, and claims incurred but not
    reported. It bases unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on:

•

case estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted
    in the aggregate for ultimate loss expectations;

•

estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past
    experience;

•

estimates of losses on insurance assumed primarily from
    involuntary market mechanisms; and

•

estimates of future expenses to be incurred in settlement of
    claims.

For the Auto & Home segment, we deduct estimated
    amounts of salvage and subrogation from unpaid losses and loss
    adjustment expenses. Implicit in all these estimates are
    underlying assumptions about rates of inflation because we
    determine all estimates using expected amounts to be paid. We
    derive estimates for the development of reported claims and for
    incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial
    analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development
    for each line of business. Similarly, we derive estimates of
    unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial
    analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship
    of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business.
    We anticipate ultimate recoveries from salvage and subrogation
    principally on the basis of historical recovery patterns. We
    calculate and record a single best estimate liability, in
    conformance with GAAP, for reported losses and for incurred but
    not reported losses. We aggregate these estimates to form the
    liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.

Pursuant to state insurance laws, the Holding Company’s
    insurance subsidiaries establish statutory reserves, reported as
    liabilities, to meet their obligations on their respective
    policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts
    sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken
    together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed
    rates. Statutory reserves generally differ from actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits determined using GAAP.

The New York Insurance Law and regulations require certain
    MetLife entities to submit to the New York Superintendent of
    Insurance (the “Superintendent”) or other state
    insurance departments, with each annual report, an opinion and
    memorandum of a “qualified actuary” that the statutory
    reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of
    specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such
    statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, make adequate
    provision for their statutory liabilities with respect to these
    obligations. See “— Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve
    Sufficiency Analysis.”

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of its actuarial
    liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts we will
    ultimately pay with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and
    the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts,
    particularly when payments may not occur until well into the
    future.

However, we believe our actuarial liabilities for future
    benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to
    be paid to policyholders. We periodically review our estimates
    of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them
    with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent
    permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future
    expected experience differs from assumptions used in the
    development of actuarial liabilities.

We have experienced, and will likely in the future experience,
    catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism that may have
    an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition. Catastrophes can be



caused by various events, including pandemics, hurricanes,
    windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe
    winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and
    blizzards), fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks.
    Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing,
    severity or amount of catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we
    make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance
    to manage risk from these perils.

Underwriting
    and Pricing

Institutional,
    Individual and International

Our underwriting for the Institutional and Individual segments
    involves an evaluation of applications for life, disability,
    dental, critical illness, retirement & savings, and
    LTC insurance products and services by a professional staff of
    underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the
    amount of risk that we are willing to accept. Within the
    International segment, similar products described above are
    offered to individual and institutional customers, as well as
    credit insurance and in a limited number of countries major
    medical products are offered. We employ detailed underwriting
    policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the
    underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks before issuing
    policies to qualified applicants or groups.

Individual underwriting considers not only an applicant’s
    medical history, but also other factors such as financial
    profiles, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and
    tobacco use. Our group underwriters generally evaluate the risk
    characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with
    certain voluntary products, employees may be underwritten on an
    individual basis. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any
    risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of
    policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage
    are reviewed on their merits and generally a policy is not
    issued unless the particular risk or group has been examined and
    approved for underwriting. We generally perform our own
    underwriting; however, certain policies are reviewed by
    intermediaries under strict guidelines established by us.

To maintain high standards of underwriting quality and
    consistency, we engage in a multi-level series of ongoing
    internal underwriting audits, and are subject to external audits
    by our reinsurers, at both our remote underwriting offices and
    our corporate underwriting office.

We have established senior level oversight of the underwriting
    process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of
    our customers, while supporting our financial strength and
    business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting,
    mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in
    our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and
    establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and
    strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer,
    the agent and us.

Pricing for the Institutional, Individual and International
    segments reflects our insurance underwriting standards. Product
    pricing of insurance products is based on the expected payout of
    benefits calculated through the use of assumptions for
    mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment
    returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as
    inflation. Product specifications are designed to mitigate the
    risks of greater than expected mortality, and we periodically
    monitor mortality and morbidity assumptions.

Investment-oriented products are priced based on various
    factors, which may include investment return, expenses,
    persistency and optionality.

Pricing for certain products in the Institutional segment and
    the institutional business sold within the International segment
    is experience rated. We employ both prospective and
    retrospective experience rating. Prospective experience rating
    involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of
    determining future premium rates. Retrospective experience
    rating involves the evaluation of past experience for the
    purpose of determining the actual cost of providing insurance
    for the customer for the period of time in question.

We continually review our underwriting and pricing guidelines so
    that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our
    marketing strategies and profitability goals. Decisions are
    based on established actuarial pricing and risk selection
    principles to ensure that our underwriting and pricing
    guidelines are appropriate.



Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home’s underwriting function has six
    principal aspects:

•

evaluating potential worksite marketing employer accounts and
    independent agencies;

•

establishing guidelines for the binding of risks;

•

reviewing coverage bound by agents;

•

underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis,
    presented by agents outside the scope of their binding authority;

•

pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable
    Auto & Home to issue a policy within our
    guidelines; and

•

ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates
    commensurate with risk.

Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of
    Auto & Home’s distribution channels, as well as
    in our Institutional segment, have binding authority for risks
    which fall within Auto & Home’s published
    underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting
    guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting
    department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call
    the underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the
    risk themselves. In most states, Auto & Home generally
    has the right within a specified period (usually the first
    60 days) to cancel any policy.

Auto & Home establishes prices for its major lines of
    insurance based on its proprietary database, rather than relying
    on rating bureaus. Auto & Home determines prices in
    part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The
    pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account,
    among other things, the expected frequency and severity of
    losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of
    acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and
    other administrative and overhead costs), competitive factors
    and profit considerations.

The major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include
    characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and
    model or construction type, characteristics of insureds, such as
    driving record and loss experience, and the insured’s
    personal financial management. Auto & Home’s
    ability to set and change rates is subject to regulatory
    oversight.

As a condition of our license to do business in each state,
    Auto & Home, like all other automobile insurers, is
    required to write or share the cost of private passenger
    automobile insurance for higher risk individuals who would
    otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This
    “involuntary” market, also called the “shared
    market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations
    of each state, and policies written in this market are generally
    written at rates higher than standard rates.

Reinsurance

Reinsurance is written on a facultative basis or an automatic
    treaty basis. Facultative reinsurance is individually
    underwritten by the reinsurer for each policy to be reinsured,
    considering factors deemed appropriate by the reinsurer. An
    automatic reinsurance treaty provides that risks will be ceded
    on specified blocks of business where the underlying policies
    meet the criteria specified in the reinsurance treaty. In
    contrast to facultative reinsurance, the reinsurer does not
    approve each individual risk for automatic reinsurance.
    Automatic reinsurance treaties generally provide that the
    reinsurer will be liable for a portion of the risk associated
    with specified policies written by the ceding company.

Reinsurance
    Activity

In addition to the activity of the Reinsurance segment, which
    assumes insurance risk from other insurers, we cede premiums to
    other insurers under various agreements that cover individual
    risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, primarily on a
    coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess
    basis. These reinsurance agreements spread the risk and minimize
    the effect of losses. The amount of each risk retained by us
    depends on our evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in
    certain circumstances, to maximum limits based on the



characteristics of coverages. We also cede first dollar
    mortality risk under certain contracts. We obtain reinsurance
    when capital requirements and the economic terms of the
    reinsurance make it appropriate to do so. Within the Reinsurance
    segment, RGA utilizes retrocessional reinsurance treaties as
    part of its overall mortality risk management program. In the
    normal course of business, RGA seeks to limit its exposure to
    loss on any single insured and to recover a portion of benefits
    paid by ceding reinsurance to other insurance enterprises or
    retrocessionaires under excess coverage and coinsurance
    contracts. Additionally, RGA systematically reduces its
    retention on certain treaties utilizing a number of retrocession
    arrangements whereby certain business in-force is retroceded on
    an automatic or facultative basis. RGA also retrocedes most of
    its financial reinsurance business to other insurance companies
    to alleviate statutory capital requirements created by this
    business.

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer
    agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event the
    claim is paid. However, we remain liable to our policyholders
    with respect to ceded reinsurance should any reinsurer be unable
    to meet its obligations under these agreements. Since we bear
    the risk of nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we
    primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized, highly rated
    reinsurers. Within the Reinsurance segment, RGA has never
    experienced a material default in connection with retrocession
    arrangements, nor has it experienced any material difficulty in
    collecting claims recoverable from retrocessionaires; however,
    no assurance can be given as to the future performance of such
    retrocessionaires or as to the recoverability of any such claims.

Individual

Our life insurance operations participate in reinsurance
    activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large
    risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We
    have historically reinsured the mortality risk on new individual
    life insurance policies primarily on an excess of retention
    basis or a quota share basis. Until 2005, we reinsured up to 90%
    of the mortality risk for all new individual life insurance
    policies that we wrote through our various franchises. This
    practice was initiated by the different franchises for different
    products starting at various points in time between 1992 and
    2000. During 2005, we changed our retention practices for
    certain individual life insurance policies. Amounts reinsured in
    prior years remain reinsured under the original reinsurance;
    however, under the new retention guidelines, we reinsure up to
    90% of the mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most
    new individual life insurance policies that we write through our
    various franchises and for certain individual life policies the
    retention strategy remained unchanged. On a case by case basis,
    we may retain up to $20 million per life and reinsure 100%
    of amounts in excess of our retention limits. We evaluate our
    reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or decrease our
    retention at any time. In addition, we reinsure a significant
    portion of the mortality risk on our individual universal life
    policies issued since 1983. Placement of reinsurance is done
    primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis
    for risks with specific characteristics.

In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, we
    reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. We
    routinely reinsure certain classes of risks in order to limit
    our exposure to particular travel, avocation and lifestyle
    hazards. We have exposure to catastrophes, which could
    contribute to significant fluctuations in our results of
    operations. We use excess of retention and quota share
    reinsurance arrangements to provide greater diversification of
    risk and minimize exposure to larger risks.

We reinsure our business through a diversified group of
    reinsurers. No single unaffiliated reinsurer has a material
    obligation to us, nor is our business substantially dependent
    upon any reinsurance contracts.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home purchases reinsurance to control our
    exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to
    protect statutory surplus. Auto & Home cedes to
    reinsurers a portion of losses and cedes premiums based upon the
    risk and exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance.

To control our exposure to large property and casualty losses,
    Auto & Home utilizes property catastrophe, casualty,
    and property per risk excess of loss agreements.

    quota-share reinsurance agreement and is included within
    Corporate & Other as a run-off business.

Regulation

Insurance
    Regulation

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is licensed to transact
    insurance business in, and is subject to regulation and
    supervision by, all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
    Puerto Rico, Canada, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern
    Mariana Islands. Each of the Holding Company’s other
    insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in all
    U.S. and international jurisdictions where they conduct
    insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but
    most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the
    financial aspects of insurers, including standards of solvency,
    statutory reserves, reinsurance and capital adequacy, and the
    business conduct of insurers. In addition, statutes and
    regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their
    agents, the approval of policy forms and certain other related
    materials and, for certain lines of insurance, the approval of
    rates. Such statutes and regulations also prescribe the
    permitted types and concentration of investments. The New York
    Insurance Law limits both the amounts of agent compensation
    throughout the United States, as well as the sales commissions
    and certain other marketing expenses that may be incurred in
    connection with the sale of life insurance policies and annuity
    contracts.

The Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries are each
    required to file reports, generally including detailed annual
    financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in
    each of the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their
    operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by
    such authorities. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many
    jurisdictions and in some lines of insurance obtain regulatory
    approval for, rules, rates and forms relating to the insurance
    written in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) has established a program of accrediting
    state insurance departments. NAIC accreditation permits
    accredited states to conduct periodic examinations of insurers
    domiciled in such states. NAIC-accredited states will not accept
    reports of examination of insurers from unaccredited states,
    except under limited circumstances. As a direct result, insurers
    domiciled in unaccredited states may be subject to financial
    examination by accredited states in which they are licensed, in
    addition to any examinations conducted by their domiciliary
    states. The New York State Department of Insurance (the
    “Department”), MLIC’s principal insurance
    regulator, has not received accreditation. Historically, the
    lack of accreditation has resulted from the New York
    legislature’s failure to adopt certain model NAIC laws.
    Although legislation enacted by the New York legislature in
    2007 may have removed any statutory barriers to the
    Department pursuing accreditation, it is not certain whether the
    Department may seek to become accredited in the future, or
    whether other impediments to accreditation remain. We do not
    believe that the absence of this accreditation will have a
    significant impact upon our ability to conduct our insurance
    businesses.

State and federal insurance and securities regulatory
    authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and
    attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding
    compliance by the Holding Company and its insurance subsidiaries
    with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations
    regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities
    businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective
    action when warranted. See “Legal Proceedings.”

Holding Company Regulation.

The Holding
    Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation
    under the insurance holding company laws of various
    jurisdictions. The insurance holding company laws and
    regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but
    generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that
    are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register
    with state regulatory authorities and to file with those
    authorities certain reports, including information concerning
    their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain
    intercompany transactions and general business operations.

State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and
    limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
    payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent
    companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its
    affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Holding
    Company.” The New York Insurance



Law and the regulations thereunder also restrict the aggregate
    amount of investments MLIC may make in non-life insurance
    subsidiaries, and provide for detailed periodic reporting on
    subsidiaries.

Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements.

Most of the jurisdictions in which
    the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are admitted to
    transact business require life and property and casualty
    insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate
    in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay certain
    contractual insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
    offsets.

In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against
    the Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries have not been
    material. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund
    assessments that we consider adequate for assessments with
    respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency
    proceedings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Insolvency Assessments.”

Statutory Insurance Examination.

As part of
    their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments
    conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records,
    accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their
    states. During the three-year period ended December 31,
    2007, MetLife, Inc. has not received any material adverse
    findings resulting from state insurance department examinations
    of its insurance subsidiaries conducted during this three-year
    period.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to MLIC’s,
    New England Life Insurance Company’s
    (“NELICO”) or GALIC’s sales of individual life
    insurance policies or annuities. Over the past several years,
    these and a number of investigations by other regulatory
    authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain
    other relief. We may continue to resolve investigations in a
    similar manner.

Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
    Analysis.

Annually, MetLife, Inc.’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct an
    analysis of the sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In each
    case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states
    that the statutory reserves, when considered in light of the
    assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and
    sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations
    and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot
    be provided, the insurer must set up additional reserves by
    moving funds from surplus. Since inception of this requirement,
    the Company’s insurance subsidiaries which are required by
    their states of domicile to provide these opinions have provided
    such opinions without qualifications.

Surplus and Capital.

The Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision
    of the regulators in each jurisdiction in which they are
    licensed to transact business. Regulators have discretionary
    authority, in connection with the continued licensing of these
    insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit sales to
    policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine
    that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or
    capital or that the further transaction of business will be
    hazardous to policyholders. See “— Risk-Based
    Capital.”

Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”).

Each of
    the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject
    to certain RBC requirements and reports their RBC based on a
    formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium
    and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the
    risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk,
    insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. The
    formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify
    possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of
    initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank
    insurers generally. State insurance laws provide insurance
    regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take
    various actions against, insurers whose RBC ratio does not
    exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent
    annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance
    regulators, the RBC of each of these subsidiaries was in excess
    of each of those RBC levels. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Capital.”

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Codification”) in 2001. Codification was
    intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to
    state insurance departments. However, statutory



accounting principles continue to be established by individual
    state laws and permitted practices. The Department has adopted
    Codification with certain modifications for the preparation of
    statutory financial statements of insurance companies domiciled
    in New York. Modifications by the various state insurance
    departments may impact the effect of Codification on the
    statutory capital and surplus of the Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries.

Regulation of Investments.

Each of the
    Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    state laws and regulations that require diversification of its
    investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in
    certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed
    income securities, equity real estate, other equity investments,
    and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and
    regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory
    limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of
    measuring surplus, and, in some instances, would require
    divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that
    the investments made by each of the Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with such
    regulations at December 31, 2007.

Federal Initiatives.

Although the federal
    government generally does not directly regulate the insurance
    business, federal initiatives often have an impact on our
    business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal
    measures are proposed which may significantly affect the
    insurance business; the potential for this resides primarily in
    the tax-writing committees. At the present time, we do not know
    of any federal legislative initiatives that, if enacted, would
    adversely impact our business, results of operations or
    financial condition.

Legislative Developments.

On August 17,
    2006, President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (“PPA”) into law. This act is considered to be the
    most sweeping pension legislation since the adoption of the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”) on September 2, 1974. The provisions of
    the PPA may, over time, have a significant impact on demand for
    pension, retirement savings, and lifestyle protection products
    in both the institutional and retail markets. The impact of the
    legislation may have a positive effect on the life insurance and
    financial services industries in the future. In the short-term,
    regulations on a number of key provisions have either been
    issued in proposed or final form. The final default investment
    regulations were issued in October 2007. Final guidance on
    investment advice and the selection of annuity providers for
    defined contribution plans is expected to be issued in 2008. As
    these regulations are likely to interact with one another as
    plan sponsors evaluate them, we cannot predict whether these
    regulations will be adopted as proposed, or what impact, if any,
    such proposals may have on our business, results of operations
    or financial condition.

On February 8, 2006, President Bush signed into law the
    Deficit Reduction Act which, among other things, creates a
    national LTC partnership program. States are now implementing
    the partnership program. While it is possible that the
    implementation of this program could have a positive effect on
    our LTC business, we can give no assurance that this will be the
    case.

We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what
    legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any
    such legislation on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

Broker-Dealer
    and Securities Regulation

Some of the Company’s subsidiaries and their activities in
    offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to
    extensive regulation under the federal securities laws
    administered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”). These subsidiaries issue variable annuity
    contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate
    accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
    (the “Investment Company Act”). Each registered
    separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of
    which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a
    registered investment company under the Investment Company Act.
    In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life
    insurance policies issued by the separate accounts are
    registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended (the “Securities Act”). Other subsidiaries are
    registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
    and are members of, and subject to, regulation by the Financial
    Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Further, some
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are registered as investment
    advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
    as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”), and are
    also registered as investment advisers in various states, as
    applicable. Certain variable



contract separate accounts sponsored by the Company’s
    subsidiaries are exempt from registration, but may be subject to
    other provisions of the federal securities laws.

Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA
    from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations
    regarding compliance by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries
    with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate
    with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action
    when warranted.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to protect investors in the securities markets and
    generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and
    enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the
    conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and
    regulations. We may also be subject to similar laws and
    regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide
    investment advisory services, offer products similar to those
    described above, or conduct other activities.

Environmental
    Considerations

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to
    extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also
    the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities
    and costs in connection with any required remediation of such
    properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies
    that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities.
    We routinely have environmental assessments performed with
    respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real
    property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide
    assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not
    arise. However, based on information currently available to
    management, management believes that any costs associated with
    compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any
    remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations or financial
    condition.

ERISA
    Considerations

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit
    plans that are subject to ERISA, or the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, our activities
    are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code,
    including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must
    perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan
    participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under ERISA
    and the Code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to
    engage in prohibited transactions with persons who have certain
    relationships with respect to such plans. The applicable
    provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by
    the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”).

In

John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v.

Harris Trust and Savings Bank (1993)

, the
    U.S. Supreme Court held that certain assets in excess of
    amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations under a
    participating group annuity general account contract are
    “plan assets.” Therefore, these assets are subject to
    certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA, which requires
    fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interest of
    ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries. On January 5,
    2000, the Secretary of Labor issued final regulations
    indicating, in cases where an insurer has issued a policy backed
    by the insurer’s general account to or for an employee
    benefit plan, the extent to which assets of the insurer
    constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. The
    regulations apply only with respect to a policy issued by an
    insurer on or before December 31, 1998 (“Transition
    Policy”). No person will generally be liable under ERISA or
    the Code for conduct occurring prior to July 5, 2001, where
    the basis of a claim is that insurance company general account
    assets constitute plan assets. An insurer issuing a new policy
    that is backed by its general account and is issued to or for an
    employee benefit plan after December 31, 1998 will
    generally be subject to fiduciary obligations under ERISA,
    unless the policy is a guaranteed benefit policy.

The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so
    that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be
    considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These
    requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the
    employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must
    permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 day
    notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder’s
    option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance
    (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or (ii) a
    book value



payment of such amount in annual installments with interest. We
    have taken and continue to take steps designed to ensure
    compliance with these regulations.

Financial
    Holding Company Regulation

Regulatory Agencies.

In connection with its
    acquisition of a federally-chartered commercial bank, MetLife,
    Inc. became a bank holding company and financial holding company
    on February 28, 2001. As such, the Holding Company is
    subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of
    1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and to inspection,
    examination, and supervision by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). In addition, the
    Holding Company’s banking subsidiary is subject to
    regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and secondarily by
    the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Financial Holding Company Activities.

As a
    financial holding company, MetLife, Inc.’s activities and
    investments are restricted by the BHC Act, as amended by the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), to
    those that are “financial” in nature or
    “incidental” or “complementary” to such
    financial activities. Activities that are financial in nature
    include securities underwriting, dealing and market making,
    sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance
    underwriting and agency, merchant banking and activities that
    the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking. In
    addition, under the insurance company investment portfolio
    provision of the GLB Act, financial holding companies are
    authorized to make investments in other financial and
    non-financial companies, through their insurance subsidiaries,
    that are in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
    with state insurance law, provided the financial holding company
    does not routinely manage or operate such companies except as
    may be necessary to obtain a reasonable return on investment.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies —
    Capital.

MetLife, Inc. and its insured depository
    institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank, are subject to risk-based
    and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal banking
    regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding companies.
    The federal banking regulatory agencies are required by law to
    take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to
    institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. At
    December 31, 2007, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank were in
    compliance with the aforementioned guidelines.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Consumer Protection
    Laws.

Numerous other federal and state laws also
    affect the Holding Company’s and MetLife Bank’s
    earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer
    protection laws. The GLB Act included consumer privacy
    provisions that, among other things, require disclosure of a
    financial institution’s privacy policy to customers. In
    addition, these provisions permit states to adopt more extensive
    privacy protections through legislation or regulation.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Change of
    Control.

Because MetLife, Inc. is a financial
    holding company and bank holding company under the federal
    banking laws, no person may acquire control of MetLife, Inc.
    without the prior approval of the FRB. A change of control is
    conclusively presumed upon acquisitions of 25% or more of any
    class of voting securities and rebuttably presumed upon
    acquisitions of 10% or more of any class of voting securities.
    Further, as a result of MetLife, Inc.’s ownership of
    MetLife Bank, approval from the OCC would be required in
    connection with a change of control (generally presumed upon the
    acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities) of
    MetLife, Inc.

Competition

Our management believes that competition faced by our business
    segments is based on a number of factors, including service,
    product features, scale, price, financial strength,
    claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, ebusiness capabilities
    and name recognition. We compete with a large number of other
    insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services
    companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for
    individual consumers, employer and other group customers and
    agents and other distributors of insurance and investment
    products. Some of these companies offer a broader array of
    products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to
    other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability
    ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with
    which to compete.



We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurance companies for sales
    representatives with demonstrated ability. We compete with other
    insurance companies for sales representatives primarily on the
    basis of our financial position, support services and
    compensation and product features. See
    “— Individual — Marketing and
    Distribution.” We continue to undertake several initiatives
    to grow our career agency force, while continuing to enhance the
    efficiency and production of our existing sales force. We cannot
    provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in
    attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual
    insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of
    operations and financial position could be materially adversely
    affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining
    agents.

Many of our insurance products, particularly those offered by
    our Institutional segment, are underwritten annually and,
    accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able
    to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than
    renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a
    result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other
    products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

The U.S. Congress periodically considers reforms to the
    nation’s healthcare system. While we offer non-medical
    health insurance products (such as group dental insurance, LTC
    and disability insurance), we generally do not offer medical
    indemnity products or managed care products, and, accordingly,
    we do not expect to be directly affected by such proposals to
    any significant degree. However, the uncertain environment
    resulting from healthcare reform could cause group health
    insurance providers to enter some of the markets in which we do
    business, thereby increasing competition. Increasing healthcare
    costs are causing consumers to seek alternative financial
    protection products. As a result, we have entered the fixed
    benefit critical illness insurance marketplace. Changes to the
    healthcare system may make this market more or less attractive
    in the future.

    Regulation — Legislative Developments” for

Rating
    Stability Indicators

Rating agencies use an “outlook statement” of
    “positive,” “stable” or “negative”
    to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals
    which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A rating may
    have a “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is
    not expected to change; however, a “stable” rating
    does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any
    time, without notice.

The foregoing insurer financial strength ratings reflect each
    rating agency’s opinion of MLIC and the Holding
    Company’s other insurance subsidiaries’ financial
    characteristics with respect to their ability to pay obligations
    under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their
    terms, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of
    investors in the Holding Company’s securities. Credit
    ratings are opinions of each agency with respect to specific
    securities and contractual financial obligations and the
    issuer’s ability and willingness to meet those obligations
    when due. Neither insurer financial strength nor credit ratings
    are statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase,
    hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating
    should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

A ratings downgrade (or the potential for such a downgrade) of
    MLIC or any of the Holding Company’s other insurance
    subsidiaries could potentially, among other things, increase the
    number of policies surrendered and withdrawals by policyholders
    of cash values from their policies, adversely affect
    relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers
    and other distributors of our products and services, negatively
    impact new sales, and adversely affect our ability to compete
    and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Changes
    in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our
    Profitability

Some of our products, principally traditional whole life
    insurance, fixed annuities and GICs, expose us to the risk that
    changes in interest rates will reduce our “spread,” or
    the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay
    under the contracts in the Company’s general account and
    the rate of return we are able to earn on general account
    investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
    Our spread is a key component of our net income.

As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be
    forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured
    or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our
    investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the
    fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and
    mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with
    greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates,
    which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates
    can help offset decreases in investment margins on some
    products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be
    limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates
    and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset
    yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially
    become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an
    important component in the amortization of deferred policy
    acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of business
    acquired (“VOBA”) and significantly lower spreads may
    cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income
    in the affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of
    declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products
    may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers,
    resulting in increased premium payments on products with
    flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and
    increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance
    policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period
    when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in
    market interest rates could also reduce our return on
    investments that do not support particular policy obligations.
    Accordingly, declining interest rates may materially adversely
    affect our results of operations, financial position and cash
    flows and significantly reduce our profitability.

Our results in Taiwan are highly sensitive to interest rates and
    other related assumptions because of the sustained low interest
    rate environment in Taiwan coupled with long-term interest rate
    guarantees of approximately 6% embedded in the life and health
    contracts sold prior to 2003 and the lack of availability of
    long-duration assets in



the Taiwanese capital markets to match such long-duration
    liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2006, our Taiwanese
    operation recorded a loss recognition adjustment (in the form of
    accelerated DAC amortization) of $50 million, net of income
    tax, due, principally, to the continued low interest rate
    environment. The loss recognition testing that resulted in the
    charge during the fourth quarter of 2006 used a current best
    estimate of Taiwanese interest rates of 2.1% rising to 3.5% over
    the next ten years and a corresponding increase in related lapse
    rates. If interest rates and related lapse assumptions do not
    improve, notwithstanding other actions we may take to reduce the
    impact, current estimates of future loss recognition of as much
    as $100 million, net of income tax, could be recognized in
    our results of operations in one or more future periods and
    additional capital may be required to be contributed to the
    Taiwanese operation. The results of loss recognition testing for
    Taiwan are inherently uncertain given the use of various
    assumptions and the long-term nature of the liability, and
    therefore, can only be reliably estimated within broad ranges
    which may vary significantly in future periods.

Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect
    our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest
    rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the
    assets in the Company’s general account with higher
    yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates
    necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We,
    therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower
    profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of
    existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy
    loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as
    policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as
    interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows
    requiring that we sell invested assets at a time when the prices
    of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in market
    interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses.
    Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us to
    accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which would
    increase our current expenses and reduce net income. An increase
    in market interest rates could also have a material adverse
    effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by
    decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that
    comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio.

Industry
    Trends Could Adversely Affect the Profitability of Our
    Businesses

Our business segments continue to be influenced by a variety of
    trends that affect the insurance industry. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Results of
    Operations — Industry Trends.”

Financial and Economic Environment.

During
    2007, the global capital markets reassessed the credit risk
    inherent in sub-prime mortgages. This reassessment led to a
    fairly broad repricing of all credit risk assets and strained
    market liquidity. Global central banks intervened to stabilize
    market conditions and protect against downside risks to economic
    growth. Still, market and economic conditions continued to
    deteriorate. The economic community’s consensus outlook of
    global economic growth is lower for calendar year 2008, with a
    sizable minority of economists forecasting a recessionary
    environment. The global capital markets have adjusted towards
    this consensus outlook, with interest rates and equity prices
    falling and risk spreads widening. Slow growth and recessionary
    periods are often associated with declining asset prices, lower
    interest rates, credit rating agency downgrades and increasing
    default losses. The global capital markets are also less liquid
    now than in more normal environments. Liquidity conditions
    impact the cost of purchasing and selling assets and, at times,
    the ability to purchase or sell assets. These adjustments in the
    global capital markets have also resulted in higher realized and
    expected volatility.

As expectations for global economic growth are lowered, factors
    such as consumer spending, business investment, government
    spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets,
    and inflation all affect the business and economic environment
    and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of the business we
    conduct. In an economic downturn characterized by higher
    unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings,
    lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the
    demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely
    affected. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings
    negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Competitive Pressures.

The life insurance
    industry remains highly competitive. The product development and
    product life-cycles have shortened in many product segments,
    leading to more intense competition with respect to product
    features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand
    equity, product development, technology



and risk management, which are among the fundamentals for
    sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. In
    addition, several of the industry’s products can be quite
    homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Sufficient
    scale, financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming
    prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance
    industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity
    to invest in additional distribution capability and the
    information technology needed to offer the superior customer
    service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry
    client base. See “— Competitive Factors May
    Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability” and
    “Business — Competition.”

Regulatory Changes.

The life insurance
    industry is regulated at the state level, with some products and
    services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers
    introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine
    capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for
    the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or
    currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and
    capital requirements of the industry. In addition, regulators
    have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several
    markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities,
    variable annuities and group products. See “— Our
    Insurance Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth” and “Business —
    Regulation — Insurance Regulation.”

Pension Plans.

On August 17, 2006,
    President Bush signed the PPA into law. The PPA is a
    comprehensive reform of defined benefit and defined contribution
    plan rules. While the impact of the PPA is generally expected to
    be positive over time, these changes may have adverse short-term
    effects on our business as plan sponsors may react to these
    changes in a variety of ways as the new rules and related
    regulations begin to take effect.

A
    Decline in Equity Markets or an Increase in Volatility in Equity
    Markets May Adversely Affect Sales of Our Investment Products
    and Our Profitability

Significant downturns and volatility in equity markets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations in three principal ways.

First, market downturns and volatility may discourage purchases
    of separate account products, such as variable annuities,
    variable life insurance and mutual funds that have returns
    linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause
    some of our existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce
    investments in those products.

Second, downturns and volatility in equity markets can have a
    material adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our
    savings and investment products and services. Because these
    products and services depend on fees related primarily to the
    value of assets under management, a decline in the equity
    markets could reduce our revenues by reducing the value of the
    investment assets we manage. The retail annuity business in
    particular is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a
    sustained weakness in the markets will decrease revenues and
    earnings in variable annuity products.

Third, we provide certain guarantees within some of our products
    that protect policyholders against significant downturns in the
    equity markets. For example, we offer variable annuity products
    with guaranteed features, such as minimum death and withdrawal
    benefits. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in
    volatile or declining equity market conditions, causing us to
    increase liabilities for future policy benefits, negatively
    affecting net income.

Adverse
    Credit Market Conditions May Significantly Affect Our Access to
    Capital, Cost of Capital and Ability to Meet Liquidity
    Needs

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets may
    limit our access to capital which is required to operate our
    business, most significantly our insurance operations. Such
    market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely
    manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital
    requirements; meet liquidity needs; and access the capital
    necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to
    delay raising capital, issue shorter tenors than we prefer, or
    pay unattractive interest rates; thereby, increasing our
    interest expense, decreasing our profitability and significantly
    reducing our financial flexibility. Overall, our results of
    operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory
    capital position could be materially adversely affected by
    disruptions in the financial markets.



The
    Performance of Our Investments Depends on Conditions that Are
    Outside Our Control, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from
    Period to Period

The performance of our investment portfolio depends in part upon
    the level of and changes in interest rates, risk spreads, equity
    prices, real estate values, foreign currency exchange rates,
    market volatility, the performance of the economy in general,
    the performance of the specific obligors included in our
    portfolio and other factors that are beyond our control. Changes
    in these factors can affect our net investment income in any
    period, and such changes can be substantial.

We invest a portion of our invested assets in pooled investment
    funds many of which make private equity investments. The amount
    and timing of income from such investment funds tends to be
    uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying
    investments, including private equity investments. The timing of
    distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events
    relating to the underlying investments, as well as the
    funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs
    for cash can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of
    income that we record from these investments can vary
    substantially from quarter to quarter. Recent equity and credit
    market volatility may reduce investment income for these type of
    investments in the near term.

Competitive
    Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and
    Profitability

Our business segments are subject to intense competition. We
    believe that this competition is based on a number of factors,
    including service, product features, scale, price, financial
    strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings,

e-business

capabilities and name recognition. We compete with a large
    number of other insurers, as well as non-insurance financial
    services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset
    managers, for individual consumers, employers and other group
    customers and agents and other distributors of insurance and
    investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader
    array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with
    respect to other insurers, have higher claims paying ability
    ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with
    which to compete. National banks, which may sell annuity
    products of life insurers in some circumstances, also have
    pre-existing customer bases for financial services products.

Many of our insurance products, particularly those offered by
    our Institutional segment, are underwritten annually, and,
    accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able
    to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than
    renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a
    result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other
    products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

In addition, the investment management and securities brokerage
    businesses have relatively few barriers to entry and continually
    attract new entrants. Many of our competitors in these
    businesses offer a broader array of investment products and
    services and are better known than us as sellers of annuities
    and other investment products. See “Business —
    Competition.”

We May
    be Unable to Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our
    Products

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurers for sales representatives with
    demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales
    representatives primarily on the basis of our financial
    position, support services and compensation and product
    features. We continue to undertake several initiatives to grow
    our career agency force while continuing to enhance the
    efficiency and production of our existing sales force. We cannot
    provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in
    attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual
    insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of
    operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
    affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining
    agents. See “Business — Competition.”

Differences
    Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving
    Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial
    Results

Our earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our
    actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we
    use in setting prices for our products and establishing
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Our
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are
    established based on estimates by actuaries of how



much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For
    life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these
    liabilities based on many assumptions and estimates, including
    estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the
    policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy,
    the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment
    returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive.
    We establish liabilities for property and casualty claims and
    benefits based on assumptions and estimates of damages and
    liabilities incurred. To the extent that actual claims
    experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions we
    used in establishing such liabilities, we could be required to
    increase our liabilities.

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for
    future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely
    the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our
    liabilities. Such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts,
    particularly when those payments may not occur until well into
    the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on
    changes in the assumptions used to establish the liabilities, as
    well as our actual experience. We charge or credit changes in
    our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are
    established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally
    established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we
    must increase them. Such increases could affect earnings
    negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Our
    Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to
    Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk, Which Could Negatively
    Affect Our Business

Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires,
    among other things, policies and procedures to record properly
    and verify a large number of transactions and events. We have
    devoted significant resources to develop our risk management
    policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the
    future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not be
    fully effective. Many of our methods for managing risk and
    exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market
    behavior or statistics based on historical models. As a result,
    these methods may not predict future exposures, which could be
    significantly greater than our historical measures indicate.
    Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of
    information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence
    or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise
    accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate,
    complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Catastrophes
    May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and
    Reinsurance Availability

Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of
    catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that
    causes a large number of deaths. Significant influenza pandemics
    have occurred three times in the last century, but neither the
    likelihood, timing, nor the severity of a future pandemic can be
    predicted. The effectiveness of external parties, including
    governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating
    the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material
    impact on the losses experienced by us. In our group insurance
    operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one
    or more of our group insurance customers could cause a
    significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. These
    events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could
    also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our Auto & Home business has experienced, and will
    likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may
    have a material adverse impact on the business, results of
    operations and financial condition of the Auto & Home
    segment. Although Auto & Home makes every effort to
    manage our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility
    management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not
    eliminate all risk. Catastrophes can be caused by various
    events, including pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms,
    earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather
    (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards),
    fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks.
    Historically, substantially all of our catastrophe-related
    claims have related to homeowners coverages. However,
    catastrophes may also affect other Auto & Home
    coverages. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence,
    timing and severity of catastrophes. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Impact of Hurricanes” and
    Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Hurricanes and earthquakes are of particular note for our
    homeowners coverages. Areas of major hurricane exposure include
    coastal sections of the northeastern United States (including
    lower New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts),
    the Gulf Coast (including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and
    Texas) and Florida. We also have some earthquake exposure,
    primarily along the New Madrid fault line in the central United
    States and in the Pacific Northwest.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both
    the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
    event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are
    restricted to small geographic areas; however, pandemics,
    hurricanes, earthquakes and man-made catastrophes may produce
    significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are
    heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made
    catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our
    financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could
    materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial
    condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial
    condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability
    of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new
    business could also be affected. It is possible that increases
    in the value, caused by the effects of inflation or other
    factors, and geographic concentration of insured property, could
    increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the
    future.

Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we
    establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only
    after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We
    cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will
    be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. From time to
    time, states have passed legislation that has the effect of
    limiting the ability of insurers to manage risk, such as
    legislation restricting an insurer’s ability to withdraw
    from catastrophe-prone areas. While we attempt to limit our
    exposure to acceptable levels, subject to restrictions imposed
    by insurance regulatory authorities, a catastrophic event or
    multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our
    property and casualty and life insurance businesses depends in
    part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may
    not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future.
    See “— Reinsurance May Not Be Available,
    Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses.”

A
    Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or
    Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Adversely
    Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Financial strength ratings, which various Nationally Recognized
    Statistical Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) publish as
    indicators of an insurance company’s ability to meet
    contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to
    maintaining public confidence in our products, our ability to
    market our products and our competitive position. See
    “Business — Company Ratings — Insurer
    Financial Strength Ratings.”

Downgrades in our financial strength ratings could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations in many ways, including:

•

reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other
    investment products;

•

adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and
    independent sales intermediaries;

•

materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders
    and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;

•

requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and
    services to remain competitive; and

•

adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at
    reasonable prices or at all.

In addition to the financial strength ratings of the Holding
    Company’s insurance subsidiaries, various NRSROs also
    publish credit ratings for MetLife, Inc. and several of its
    subsidiaries. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt
    issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a
    timely manner. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Credit Ratings.” A downgrade in our
    credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition



and results of operations in many ways, including increasing the
    cost of borrowing or adversely affecting our relationships with
    credit counterparties.

Rating agencies assign ratings based upon many factors, some of
    which relate to general economic conditions and circumstances
    outside of our control. In addition, rating agencies employ
    different models and methods to assess our financial strength
    and creditworthiness, and may alter these models and methods
    from time to time at their discretion. We cannot predict what
    actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in
    response to the actions of rating agencies, which could
    adversely affect our business.

If Our
    Business Does Not Perform Well or if Actual Experience Versus
    Estimates Used in Valuing and Amortizing DAC and VOBA Vary
    Significantly, We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization
    and/or Impair the DAC and VOBA Which Could Adversely Affect Our
    Results of Operations or Financial Condition

We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and
    renewal business. Those costs that vary with and are primarily
    related to the production of new and renewal business are
    deferred and referred to as DAC. The recovery of DAC is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    The amount of future profit is dependent principally on
    investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to
    policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest
    crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain
    economic variables, such as inflation. Of these factors, we
    anticipate that investment returns are most likely to impact the
    rate of amortization of such costs. The aforementioned factors
    enter into management’s estimates of gross profits, which
    generally are used to amortize such costs. If the estimates of
    gross profits were overstated, then the amortization of such
    costs would be accelerated in the period the actual experience
    is known and would result in a charge to income. Such
    adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial condition.

VOBA reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in
    a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion
    of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the
    right to receive future cash flows from the insurance and
    annuity contracts in-force at the acquisition date. VOBA is
    based on actuarially determined projections. Actual experience
    may vary from the projections. Revisions to estimates result in
    changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which
    the revisions are made and could result in an impairment and a
    charge to income. Also, as VOBA is amortized similarly to DAC,
    an acceleration of the amortization of VOBA would occur if the
    estimates of gross profits were overstated. Accordingly, the
    amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period in
    which the actual experience is known and would result in a
    charge to net income. Such adjustments could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    condition.

Defaults,
    Downgrades or Other Events Impairing the Value of Our Fixed
    Maturity Securities Portfolio May Reduce Our
    Earnings

We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of
    fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and
    interest payments they owe us. At December 31, 2007, the
    fixed maturity securities of $242.2 billion in our
    investment portfolio represented 70.2% of our total cash and
    invested assets. The occurrence of a major economic downturn,
    acts of corporate malfeasance, widening risk spreads, or other
    events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of these
    securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity
    securities portfolio and our net income to decline and the
    default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment
    portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or
    guarantors of particular securities could also have a similar
    effect. With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or
    guarantors could be adversely affected. Any event reducing the
    value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

Defaults
    on Our Mortgage and Consumer Loans May Adversely Affect Our
    Profitability

Our mortgage and consumer loan investments face default risk.
    Our mortgage and consumer loans are principally collateralized
    by commercial, agricultural and residential properties, as well
    as automobiles. At December 31, 2007, our mortgage and
    consumer loan investments of $47.0 billion represented
    13.6% of our



total cash and invested assets. At December 31, 2007, loans
    that were either delinquent or in the process of foreclosure
    totaled less than 1% of our mortgage and consumer loan
    investments. The performance of our mortgage and consumer loan
    investments, however, may fluctuate in the future. In addition,
    substantially all of our mortgage loan investments have balloon
    payment maturities. An increase in the default rate of our
    mortgage and consumer loan investments could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

The
    Valuation of Investments May Include Methodologies, Estimations
    and Assumptions Which Are Subject to Differing Interpretations
    and Could Result in Changes to Investment Valuations That May
    Materially Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or
    Financial Condition

The fair values for public fixed maturity securities and public
    equity securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates
    from independent pricing services. However, in cases where
    quoted market prices are not available, such as for private
    fixed maturities, fair values are estimated using present value
    or valuation techniques. The determination of fair values in the
    absence of quoted market prices is based on: (i) valuation
    methodologies; (ii) securities we deem to be comparable;
    and (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market information and
    judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of
    the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the
    credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors
    considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate,
    maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
    requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, and
    quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of
    different methodologies and assumptions may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

During periods of market disruption including periods of
    significantly rising or high interest rates and/or rapidly
    widening credit spreads it may be difficult to value certain of
    our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market
    data becomes less observable. As such, valuations may include
    inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require
    greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more
    sophisticated or require greater estimation thereby resulting in
    values which may be less than the value at which the investments
    may be ultimately sold. Significant period-to-period changes in
    value may also result. Decreases in value may have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    condition.

Some
    of Our Investments Are Relatively Illiquid

We hold certain investments that, even under normal market
    conditions, may lack liquidity, such as privately placed fixed
    maturity securities; complex structured products; mortgage and
    consumer loans; and equity real estate, including real estate
    joint ventures; other limited partnership interests, and certain
    pooled investment funds. These asset classes represented 28% of
    the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of
    December 31, 2007. Under stressful capital market and
    economic conditions, liquidity broadly deteriorates increasing
    the price to purchase and sell assets and at times impacting the
    ability to purchase and sell assets. If we require significant
    amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash
    requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments
    in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we
    otherwise would have been able to realize, or both.

Fluctuations
    in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities
    Markets Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability

We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar resulting
    from our holdings of

non-U.S. dollar

denominated securities and investments in foreign subsidiaries.
    If the currencies of the

non-U.S. dollar

denominated securities we hold in our investment portfolios
    decline against the U.S. dollar, our investment returns,
    and thus our profitability, may be adversely affected. Although
    we use foreign currency swaps and forward contracts to mitigate
    foreign currency exchange rate risk, we cannot provide assurance
    that these methods will be effective or that our counterparties
    will perform their obligations. See “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

From time to time, various emerging market countries have
    experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including
    significant devaluations of their currencies. Our exposure to
    foreign exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in
    emerging markets.



We have matched substantially all of our foreign currency
    liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with assets denominated
    in their respective foreign currency, which limits the effect of
    currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results;
    however, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of
    these results into our consolidated financial statements.
    Although we take certain actions to address this risk, foreign
    currency exchange rate fluctuation could materially adversely
    affect our reported results due to unhedged positions or the
    failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Our
    International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and
    Other Risks That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability

Our international operations face political, legal, operational
    and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations.
    We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization
    or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls
    or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds
    from these operations out of the countries in which they operate
    or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or
    other currencies. Some of our foreign insurance operations are,
    and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where
    these risks are heightened. See “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” In addition, we
    rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter
    labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and
    trade unions in some countries. If our business model is not
    successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of
    our investment in building and training the sales force in that
    country.

We are currently planning to expand our international operations
    in markets where we operate and in selected new markets. This
    may require considerable management time, as well as

start-up

expenses for market development before any significant revenues
    and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets
    may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in
    existing markets may be affected by local economic and market
    conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not
    achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations
    may be negatively impacted.

The business we acquired from Travelers includes operations in
    several foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil,
    Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Poland, Japan and Hong
    Kong. See “Business — International.” Those
    operations, and operations in other new markets, are subject to
    the risks described above, as well as our unfamiliarity with the
    business, legal and regulatory environment in any of those
    countries.

In recent years, the operating environment in Argentina has been
    challenging. In Argentina, we are principally engaged in the
    pension business. This business has incurred significant losses
    in recent years as a result of actions taken by the Argentinean
    government in response to a sovereign debt crisis in December
    2001. Further governmental or legal actions related to pension
    reform could impact our obligations to our customers and could
    result in future losses in our Argentinean operations.

See also “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability” regarding the
    impact of low interest rates on our Taiwanese operations.

Reinsurance
    May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us
    Against Losses

As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase
    reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various
    business segments. See “Business — Reinsurance
    Activity.” While reinsurance agreements generally bind the
    reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally
    fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine
    the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new
    business. In certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for
    business already reinsured may also increase. Any decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any
    increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we
    may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or
    may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable
    terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future
    business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect
    to those policies we issue.



If the
    Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification
    Arrangements or to the Derivative Instruments We Use to Hedge
    Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed
    to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

We use reinsurance, indemnification and derivative instruments
    to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general,
    reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our
    policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us.
    Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers
    and indemnitors. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers
    will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that
    indemnitors will honor their obligations now or in the future or
    that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A
    reinsurer’s or indemnitor’s insolvency, inability or
    unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance
    agreements or indemnity agreements with us could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various
    business risks. We enter into a variety of derivative
    instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate and
    currency swaps with a number of counterparties. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments.” If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor
    their obligations under these derivative instruments, our hedges
    of the related risk will be ineffective. Such failure could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our
    Insurance Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth

Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of
    insurance and other laws and regulations. State insurance laws
    regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and
    the Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated
    by the insurance departments of the states in which they are
    domiciled and the states in which they are licensed. Our

non-U.S. insurance

operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory
    authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and
    operate. See “Business — Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation.”

State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory
    authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among
    other things:

•

licensing companies and agents to transact business;

•

calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with
    statutory requirements;

•

mandating certain insurance benefits;

•

regulating certain premium rates;

•

reviewing and approving policy forms;

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through
    the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices,
    distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;

•

regulating advertising;

•

protecting privacy;

•

establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and
    solvency standards;

•

fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and
    minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance
    policies and annuity contracts;

•

approving changes in control of insurance companies;

•

restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions
    between affiliates; and

•

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess
    insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to
    help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
    policyholders and claimants. Because the



amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the
    liabilities that we have currently established for these
    potential liabilities may not be adequate. See
    “Business — Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements.”

State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine
    existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies
    and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

The NAIC and several states’ legislatures have considered
    the need for regulations

and/or

laws
    to address agent or broker practices that have been the focus of
    investigations of broker compensation in the State of New York
    and in other jurisdictions. The NAIC adopted a Compensation
    Disclosure Amendment to its Producers Licensing Model Act which,
    if adopted by the states, would require disclosure by agents or
    brokers to customers that insurers will compensate such agents
    or brokers for the placement of insurance and documented
    acknowledgement of this arrangement in cases where the customer
    also compensates the agent or broker. Several states have
    enacted laws similar to the NAIC amendment. We cannot predict
    how many states may promulgate the NAIC amendment or alternative
    regulations or the extent to which these regulations may have a
    material adverse impact on our business.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly
    regulate the business of insurance. However, federal legislation
    and administrative policies in several areas can significantly
    and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include
    financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension
    regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In
    addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of
    insurance have been proposed. These proposals include the
    National Insurance Act of 2007, which would permit an optional
    federal charter for insurers. We cannot predict whether this or
    other proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such
    proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business,
    financial condition or results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to regulation in the
    jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is
    similar to that of the state regulation outlined above. Many of
    our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate
    in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that
    affect their operations also may affect our business
    relationships with them and their ability to purchase or
    distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time
    consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and
    regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect
    compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations
    or audits of the Holding Company’s subsidiaries that could,
    if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot
    predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that
    could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the
    interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and
    statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in
    areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.

Litigation
    and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our
    Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and
    Harm to Our Reputation

We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory
    investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating
    our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our
    pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings
    specific to us and others generally applicable to business
    practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection
    with our insurance operations, plaintiffs’ lawyers may
    bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits
    alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or
    underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product
    design, disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits
    and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers.
    Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may
    seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and
    treble damages, and the damages claimed and the amount of any
    probable and estimable liability, if any, may remain unknown for
    substantial periods of time. See “Legal Proceedings”
    and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may be inherently impossible to ascertain with
    any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties can include how
    fact finders will view individually and in their totality
    documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness of
    witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information
    with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory
    investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be
    reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The review
    includes senior legal and financial personnel. Unless stated
    elsewhere herein, estimates of possible losses or ranges of loss
    for particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be made
    with a reasonable degree of certainty. See “Legal
    Proceedings” and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Liabilities are established when it is
    probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the
    loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of matters noted in “Legal
    Proceedings” and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. It is possible that some of the matters
    could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or
    establish accruals in amounts that could not be estimated as of
    December 31, 2007.

MLIC and MetLife, Inc. have been named as defendants in several
    lawsuits brought in connection with MLIC’s demutualization
    in 2000. Although most of these lawsuits have been dismissed,
    two have been certified as nationwide class action lawsuits.
    MLIC and its affiliates also are currently defendants in
    hundreds of lawsuits raising allegations of improper marketing
    and sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities.
    These lawsuits are generally referred to as sales practices
    claims.

In addition, MLIC is a defendant in thousands of lawsuits
    seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries
    allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. These lawsuits principally have been based upon
    allegations relating to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and have alleged that MLIC learned or should have
    learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among
    other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those
    health risks. Additional litigation relating to these matters
    may be commenced in the future. The ability of MLIC to estimate
    its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable
    uncertainty due to numerous factors. The availability of data is
    limited and it is difficult to predict with any certainty
    numerous variables that can affect liability estimates,
    including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve
    claims, the disease mix and severity of disease, the
    jurisdiction of claims filed, tort reform efforts and the impact
    of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. The
    number of asbestos cases that may be brought or the aggregate
    amount of any liability that MLIC may ultimately incur is
    uncertain. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that our total
    exposure to asbestos claims may be greater than the liability
    recorded by us in our consolidated financial statements and that
    future charges to income may be necessary. The potential future
    charges could be material in particular quarterly or annual
    periods in which they are recorded.

We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as
    information requests, subpoenas and books and record
    examinations, from state and federal regulators and other
    authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant
    regulatory action against us could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the
    litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer
    significant reputational harm, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, including our ability to attract new customers,
    retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees.
    Regulatory inquiries and litigation may cause volatility in the
    price of stocks of companies in our industry.

We cannot give assurance that current claims, litigation,
    unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and
    other proceedings against us will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated
    claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion,
    investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future,
    and we could become subject to further investigations and have
    lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In
    addition, increased regulatory



scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could
    result in new legal actions and precedents and industry-wide
    regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Changes
    in Accounting Standards Issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board or Other

Standard-Setting

Bodies May Adversely Affect Our Financial
    Statements

Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP,
    which is periodically revised

and/or

expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to
    adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized
    authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting standards
    we are required to adopt could change the current accounting
    treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements
    and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes
    in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations May
    Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability

Federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to
    insurance products that are also “securities,”
    including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance
    policies. As a result, some of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries
    and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance
    contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under
    these securities laws. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity
    contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate
    accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act. Each registered
    separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of
    which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a
    registered investment company under the Investment Company Act.
    In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life
    insurance policies issued by the separate accounts are
    registered with the SEC under the Securities Act. Other
    subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under
    the Exchange Act, and are members of, and subject to, regulation
    by FINRA. Further, some of the Holding Company’s
    subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC
    under the Investment Advisers Act, and are also registered as
    investment advisers in various states, as applicable.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to
    protect investors in the securities markets, as well as protect
    investment advisory or brokerage clients. These laws and
    regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking
    and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict
    the conduct of business for failure to comply with the
    securities laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or
    regulations that restrict the conduct of our business could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. In particular, changes in the regulations
    governing the registration and distribution of variable
    insurance products, such as changes in the regulatory standards
    for suitability of variable annuity contracts or variable life
    insurance policies, could have such a material adverse effect.

Changes
    in Tax Laws Could Make Some of Our Products Less Attractive to
    Consumers; Changes in Tax Laws, Tax Regulations, or
    Interpretations of Such Laws or Regulations Could Increase Our
    Corporate Taxes

Changes in tax laws could make some of our products less
    attractive to consumers. For example, reductions in the federal
    income tax that investors are required to pay on long-term
    capital gains and dividends paid on stock may provide an
    incentive for some of our customers and potential customers to
    shift assets away from some insurance company products,
    including life insurance and annuities, designed to defer taxes
    payable on investment returns. Because the income taxes payable
    on long-term capital gains and some dividends paid on stock has
    been reduced, investors may decide that the tax-deferral
    benefits of annuity contracts are less advantageous than the
    potential after-tax income benefits of mutual funds or other
    investment products that provide dividends and long-term capital
    gains. A shift away from life insurance and annuity contracts
    and other tax-deferred products would reduce our income from
    sales of these products, as well as the assets upon which we
    earn investment income.

We cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting
    insurance products will be enacted, what the specific terms of
    any such legislation will be or whether, if at all, any
    legislation would have a material adverse effect on our



financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore,
    changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such
    laws or regulations could increase our corporate taxes.

State
    Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
    and Our Stockholder Rights Plan May Delay, Deter or Prevent
    Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might
    Consider in Their Best Interests

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may
    delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders
    might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may
    prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium
    over the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence
    of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may
    adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging
    takeover attempts in the future.

Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would
    face various regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or
    prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders of MetLife, Inc.
    might consider in their best interests. First, the insurance
    laws and regulations of the various states in which MetLife,
    Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or
    impede a business combination involving us. State insurance laws
    prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance
    company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance
    regulator. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is
    presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns,
    directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that
    insurance company or its parent company. Federal banking
    authorities would also have to approve the indirect change of
    control of our banking operations. In addition, the Investment
    Company Act would require approval by the contract owners of our
    variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of
    any affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying
    our variable contracts. Finally, FINRA approval would be
    necessary for a change of control of any FINRA registered
    broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law may affect the ability of an “interested
    stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations,
    including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional
    shares, for a period of three years following the time that the
    stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” An
    “interested stockholder” is defined to include persons
    owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding
    voting stock of a corporation.

MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws
    also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a
    takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best
    interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing
    market prices for MetLife, Inc.’s common stock and include:
    classification of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors into
    three classes; a prohibition on the calling of special meetings
    by stockholders; advance notice procedures for the nomination of
    candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals
    to be considered at stockholder meetings; and supermajority
    voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of
    the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.

The stockholder rights plan adopted by MetLife, Inc.’s
    Board of Directors may also have anti-takeover effects. The
    stockholder rights plan is designed to protect MetLife,
    Inc.’s stockholders in the event of unsolicited offers to
    acquire us and other coercive takeover tactics which, in the
    opinion of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors, could impair
    its ability to represent stockholder interests. The provisions
    of the stockholder rights plan may render an unsolicited
    takeover more difficult or less likely to occur or might prevent
    such a takeover, even though such takeover may offer MetLife,
    Inc.’s stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at
    a price above the prevailing market price and may be favored by
    a majority of MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders.

As a
    Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its
    Subsidiaries to Transfer Funds to It to Meet Its Obligations and
    Pay Dividends

MetLife, Inc. is a holding company for its insurance and
    financial subsidiaries and does not have any significant
    operations of its own. Dividends from its subsidiaries and
    permitted payments to it under its tax sharing arrangements with
    its subsidiaries are its principal sources of cash to meet its
    obligations and to pay preferred and common dividends. If the
    cash the Holding Company receives from its subsidiaries is
    insufficient for it to fund its



debt service and other holding company obligations, the Holding
    Company may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of
    debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets.

The payment of dividends and other distributions to the Holding
    Company by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance
    laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of
    prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In
    addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of
    dividends or other payments by its insurance subsidiaries to the
    Holding Company if they determine that the payment could be
    adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. See
    “Business — Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation,” “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company” and Note 18
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or
    advances by our foreign subsidiaries to the Holding Company
    could be subject to taxation or other restrictions on dividends
    or repatriation of earnings under applicable law, monetary
    transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations
    in the jurisdiction in which such foreign subsidiaries operate.
    See “— Our International Operations Face
    Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks That Could
    Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability.”

MetLife,
    Inc.’s Board of Directors May Control the Outcome of
    Stockholder Votes on Many Matters Due to the Voting Provisions
    of the MetLife Policyholder Trust

Under MLIC’s plan of reorganization, as amended (the
    “Plan”), we established the MetLife Policyholder Trust
    (the “Trust”) to hold the shares of MetLife, Inc.
    common stock allocated to eligible policyholders not receiving
    cash or policy credits under the plan. As of February 25,
    2008, 258,577,341 shares, or 36.3%, of the outstanding
    shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock, are held in the Trust.
    Because of the number of shares held in the Trust and the voting
    provisions of the Trust, the Trust may affect the outcome of
    matters brought to a stockholder vote.

Except on votes regarding certain fundamental corporate actions
    described below, the trustee will vote all of the shares of
    common stock held in the Trust in accordance with the
    recommendations given by MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to its stockholders or, if the board gives no such
    recommendations, as directed by the board. As a result of the
    voting provisions of the Trust, the Board of Directors may be
    able to control votes on matters submitted to a vote of
    stockholders, excluding those fundamental corporate actions, so
    long as the Trust holds a substantial number of shares of common
    stock.

If the vote relates to fundamental corporate actions specified
    in the Trust, the trustee will solicit instructions from the
    Trust beneficiaries and vote all shares held in the Trust in
    proportion to the instructions it receives. These actions
    include:

•

an election or removal of directors in which a stockholder has
    properly nominated one or more candidates in opposition to a
    nominee or nominees of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    or a vote on a stockholder’s proposal to oppose a board
    nominee for director, remove a director for cause or fill a
    vacancy caused by the removal of a director by stockholders,
    subject to certain conditions;

•

a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or
    substantially all of the assets, or a recapitalization or
    dissolution, of MetLife, Inc., in each case requiring a vote of
    stockholders under applicable Delaware law;

•

any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion
    of shares of common stock held by the Trust for cash, securities
    or other property; and

•

any proposal requiring MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to amend or redeem the rights under the stockholder rights plan,
    other than a proposal with respect to which we have received
    advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that
    the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action
    under Delaware law.

If a vote concerns any of these fundamental corporate actions,
    the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by
    the Trust in proportion to the instructions it received, which
    will give disproportionate weight to the instructions actually
    given by trust beneficiaries.



We May
    Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block; Assets
    Allocated to the Closed Block Benefit Only the Holders of Closed
    Block Policies

The Plan required that we establish and operate an accounting
    mechanism, known as a closed block, to ensure that the
    reasonable dividend expectations of policyholders who own
    certain individual insurance policies of MLIC are met. See
    Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We
    allocated assets to the closed block in an amount that will
    produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenue from
    the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably
    expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities
    relating to these policies, including, but not limited to,
    provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and
    tax, and to provide for the continuation of the policyholder
    dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying
    such scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such
    scales if the experience changes. We cannot provide assurance
    that the closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the
    closed block assets and the anticipated revenue from the
    policies included in the closed block will be sufficient to
    provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. If
    they are not sufficient, we must fund the shortfall. Even if
    they are sufficient, we may choose, for competitive reasons, to
    support policyholder dividend payments with our general account
    funds.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenue from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of those
    policies. In addition, to the extent that these amounts are
    greater than the amounts estimated at the time the closed block
    was funded, dividends payable in respect of the policies
    included in the closed block may be greater than they would be
    in the absence of a closed block. Any excess earnings will be
    available for distribution over time only to closed block
    policyholders.

The
    Continued Threat of Terrorism and Ongoing Military Actions May
    Adversely Affect the Level of Claim Losses We Incur and the
    Value of Our Investment Portfolio

The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States
    and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened
    security measures in response to these types of threats may
    cause significant volatility in global financial markets and
    result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions
    to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in
    our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines
    in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by
    the continued threat of terrorism. We cannot predict whether,
    and the extent to which, companies in which we maintain
    investments may suffer losses as a result of financial,
    commercial or economic disruptions, or how any such disruptions
    might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or
    principal on their securities. The continued threat of terrorism
    also could result in increased reinsurance prices and reduced
    insurance coverage and potentially cause us to retain more risk
    than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain
    reinsurance at lower prices. Terrorist actions also could
    disrupt our operations centers in the United States or abroad.
    In addition, the occurrence of terrorist actions could result in
    higher claims under our insurance policies than anticipated.

The
    Occurrence of Events Unanticipated In Our Disaster Recovery
    Systems and Management Continuity Planning Could Impair Our
    Ability to Conduct Business Effectively

In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an
    epidemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus,
    a terrorist attack or war, unanticipated problems with our
    disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact
    on our ability to conduct business and on our results of
    operations and financial position, particularly if those
    problems affect our computer-based data processing,
    transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable
    data. We depend heavily upon computer systems to provide
    reliable service. Despite our implementation of a variety of
    security measures, our servers could be subject to physical and
    electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized
    tampering with our computer systems. In addition, in the event
    that a significant number of our managers were unavailable in
    the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct
    business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also
    may interfere with our suppliers’ ability to provide goods
    and services and our employees ability to perform their job
    responsibilities.



We
    Face Unforeseen Liabilities or Asset Impairments Arising from
    Possible Acquisitions and Dispositions of
    Businesses

We have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses
    in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future.
    There could be unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments,
    including goodwill impairments, that arise in connection with
    the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we may
    acquire in the future. In addition, there may be liabilities or
    asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in
    the course of performing due diligence investigations on each
    business that we have acquired or may acquire.

Item 1B.

Unresolved
    Staff Comments

MetLife, Inc. has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff
    regarding its periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.

Item 2.

Properties

We lease approximately 685,000 rentable square feet in Long
    Island City, New York under a long-term lease arrangement with
    approximately 1,600 associates working in the Institutional,
    Individual and International segments, as well as
    Corporate & Other. We intend to relocate certain of
    these associates to new offices in Manhattan.

In December 2006, we signed a lease for approximately
    410,000 rentable square feet in Manhattan, New York to be
    located on 12 floors. The term of the lease will commence during
    2008 and will continue for approximately 21 years. We
    anticipate moving certain operations from Long Island City, New
    York, to Manhattan in late 2008, but we intend to continue to
    maintain an on-going presence in Long Island City.

In November 2006, we sold our Peter Cooper Village and
    Stuyvesant Town properties located in Manhattan, New York to a
    group led by Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty, the real
    estate arm of BlackRock, Inc., for $5.4 billion. The gain
    of approximately $3.0 billion is included in income from
    discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of income.

In 2005, we sold our 200 Park Avenue property in Manhattan, New
    York for $1.7 billion. The gain is included in income from
    discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of income. In connection with the sale of the 200
    Park Avenue property, we have retained rights to existing
    signage and are leasing space for associates in the property for
    20 years with optional renewal periods through 2205.
    Associates located in the 200 Park Avenue office, our
    headquarters, include those working in the Institutional and
    Individual segments.

We continue to own 15 other buildings in the United States that
    we use in the operation of our business. These buildings contain
    approximately 4.2 million rentable square feet and are
    located in the following states: Florida, Illinois, Missouri,
    New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island
    and Texas. Our computer center in Rensselaer, New York is not
    owned in fee but rather is occupied pursuant to a long-term
    ground lease. We lease space in approximately 570 other
    locations throughout the United States, and these leased
    facilities consist of approximately 8.4 million rentable
    square feet. Approximately 58% of these leases are occupied as
    sales offices for the Individual segment, and we use the balance
    for our other business activities. We also own five buildings
    outside the United States, comprising more than
    300,000 rentable square feet. We lease approximately
    2.5 million rentable square feet in various locations
    outside the United States. Management believes that these
    properties are suitable and adequate for our current and
    anticipated business operations.

We also own one building in Mexico that we use in the operation
    of our business. This building contains approximately 130,000
    rentable square feet.

We arrange for property and casualty coverage on our properties,
    taking into consideration our risk exposures and the cost and
    availability of commercial coverages, including deductible loss
    levels. In connection with its renewal of those coverages, we
    have arranged $700 million of annual terrorist coverage on
    our real estate portfolio through March 15, 2008, its
    annual renewal date.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the
    jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may
    permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well
    exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for
    similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with
    the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving
    through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of
    time, demonstrate to management that the monetary relief which
    may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to
    its merits or disposition value. Thus, unless stated below, the
    specific monetary relief sought is not noted.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be inherently impossible to
    ascertain with any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties
    can include how fact finders will view individually and in their
    totality documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness
    of witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. The review includes senior legal and financial
    personnel. In 2007, the Company received $39 million upon
    the resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the
    2000 acquisition of GALIC, and the Company reduced legal
    liabilities by $38 million after the settlement of certain
    cases. Unless stated below, estimates of possible losses or
    ranges of loss for particular matters cannot in the ordinary
    course be made with a reasonable degree of certainty.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Liabilities have been established for a number of the
    matters noted below; in 2007 the Company increased legal
    liabilities for pending sales practices, employment, property
    and casualty and intellectual property litigation matters
    against the Company. It is possible that some of the matters
    could require the Company to pay damages or make other
    expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be
    estimated as of December 31, 2007.

Demutualization
    Actions

Several lawsuits were brought in 2000 challenging the fairness
    of the Plan and the adequacy and accuracy of MLIC’s
    disclosure to policyholders regarding the Plan. The actions
    discussed below name as defendants some or all of MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. MLIC, the Holding
    Company, and the individual directors believe they have
    meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs’ claims and are
    contesting vigorously all of the plaintiffs’ claims in
    these actions.

Fiala, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (Sup.
    Ct., N.Y. County, filed March 17, 2000)

.  The
    plaintiffs in the consolidated state court class actions seek
    compensatory relief and punitive damages against MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. On January 30,
    2007, the trial court signed an order certifying a litigation
    class of present and former policyholders on plaintiffs’
    claim that defendants violated section 7312 of the New York
    Insurance Law, but denying plaintiffs’ motion to certify a
    litigation class with respect to a common law fraud claim.
    Plaintiffs and defendants have filed notices of appeal from this
    order. The court has directed various forms of class notice.

In re MetLife Demutualization Litig. (E.D.N.Y., filed
    April 18, 2000).

In this class action
    against MLIC and the Holding Company, plaintiffs served a second
    consolidated amended complaint in 2004. Plaintiffs assert
    violations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in
    connection with the Plan, claiming that the Policyholder
    Information Booklets failed to disclose certain material facts
    and contained certain material misstatements. They seek
    rescission and compensatory damages. By orders dated
    July 19, 2005 and August 29, 2006, the federal trial
    court certified a litigation class of present and former
    policyholders. The court has not yet directed the manner and
    form of class notice.



Asbestos-Related
    Claims

MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of
    asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in
    the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or
    selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC
    issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to
    companies in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned
    of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other
    things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health
    risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in
    these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters,
    however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables,
    including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions,
    the nature of the alleged injury, and factors unrelated to the
    ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC
    employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos
    loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending
    litigation by judicial rulings and settling litigation under
    appropriate circumstances.

Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence,
    intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks
    associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of
    certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no
    duty to the plaintiffs — it had no special
    relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture,
    produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly
    injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any
    actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the
    cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries;
    (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers
    of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with
    respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the
    litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing
    claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied
    MLIC’s motions to dismiss. There can be no assurance that
    MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future.
    While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to
    continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos
    exposure, including defending claims at trials.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate
    number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and
    the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve
    asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set
    forth in the following table:

December 31,




(In millions, except number of claims)

Asbestos personal injury claims at year end

87,070

100,250

Number of new claims during the year

7,870

18,500

Settlement payments during the year (1)

$

(1)

Settlement payments represent payments made by MLIC during the
    year in connection with settlements made in that year and in
    prior years. Amounts do not include MLIC’s attorneys’
    fees and expenses and do not reflect amounts received from
    insurance carriers.

In 2004, MLIC received approximately 23,900 new claims, ending
    the year with a total of approximately 108,000 claims, and paid
    approximately $85.5 million for settlements reached in 2004
    and prior years. In 2003, MLIC received approximately 58,750 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 111,700
    claims, and paid approximately $84.2 million for
    settlements reached in 2003 and prior years. The number of
    asbestos cases that may be brought or the aggregate amount of
    any liability that MLIC may ultimately incur is uncertain.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    MLIC’s recorded asbestos liability is based on its
    estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts
    presently known to it, its understanding of current law, and its
    past experiences: (i) the reasonably probable and estimable
    liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC,
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    reasonably probable and estimable liability for asbestos claims
    not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are
    reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal
    defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant
    assumptions underlying MLIC’s



analysis of the adequacy of its recorded liability with respect
    to asbestos litigation include: (i) the number of future
    claims; (ii) the cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the
    cost to defend claims.

MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure
    from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims
    experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos
    claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant
    trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous
    variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an
    overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies
    of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative
    and judicial developments, the number of pending claims
    involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed
    against it and other defendants, and the jurisdictions in which
    claims are pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 MLIC
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. MLIC regularly reevaluates its exposure
    from asbestos litigation and has updated its liability analysis
    for asbestos-related claims through December 31, 2007.

The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure
    is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions
    impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change.
    The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult
    to predict with any certainty the numerous variables that can
    affect liability estimates, including the number of future
    claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity
    of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the
    number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are
    filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the
    willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims
    against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the
    dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of
    any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be probable and
    reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be
    materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued
    and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the
    potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on
    information currently known by management, management does not
    believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position.

During 1998, MLIC paid $878 million in premiums for excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims. The excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims provide for
    recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion, which is in excess
    of a $400 million self-insured retention. The
    Company’s initial option to commute the excess insurance
    policies for asbestos-related claims arises at the end of 2008.
    Thereafter, the Company will have a commutation right every five
    years. The excess insurance policies for asbestos-related claims
    are also subject to annual and per claim sublimits. Amounts
    exceeding the sublimits during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    approximately $16 million, $8 million and $0,
    respectively. The Company continues to study per claim averages,
    and there can be no assurance as to the number and cost of
    claims resolved in the future, including related defense costs,
    and the applicability of the sublimits to these costs. Amounts
    are recoverable under the policies annually with respect to
    claims paid during the prior calendar year. Although amounts
    paid by MLIC in any given year that may be recoverable in the
    next calendar year under the policies will be reflected as a
    reduction in the Company’s operating cash flows for the
    year in which they are paid, management believes that the
    payments will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s liquidity.

Each asbestos-related policy contains an experience fund and a
    reference fund that provide for payments to MLIC at the
    commutation date if the reference fund is greater than zero at
    commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in the loss
    reimbursements to MLIC if the cumulative return on the reference
    fund is less than the return specified in the experience fund.
    The return in the reference fund is tied to performance of the
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500
    Index and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. A claim with
    respect to the prior year was made under the excess insurance
    policies in each year from 2003 through 2007 for the amounts
    paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of the
    retention. As the performance of the indices impacts the return
    in the reference fund, it is possible that loss reimbursements
    to the Company and the recoverable amount with respect to later
    periods may be less than the amount of the recorded losses.
    Foregone loss reimbursements may be recovered upon commutation
    depending upon future performance of the reference fund. If at
    some point in the future, the Company believes the liability for
    probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related
    claims should be increased, an expense would be recorded and the
    insurance recoverable would be adjusted subject to the terms,
    conditions and limits of the



excess insurance policies. Portions of the change in the
    insurance recoverable would be recorded as a deferred gain and
    amortized into income over the estimated remaining settlement
    period of the insurance policies. The foregone loss
    reimbursements were approximately $56.1 million with
    respect to claims for the period of 2002 through 2006 and are
    estimated, as of December 31, 2007, to be approximately
    $69.1 million in the aggregate, including future years.

Sales
    Practices Claims

Over the past several years, MLIC; New England Mutual Life
    Insurance Company, New England Life Insurance Company and New
    England Securities Corporation (collectively “New
    England”); GALIC; Walnut Street Securities and MetLife
    Securities, Inc. (“MSI”) have faced numerous claims,
    including class action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or
    sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual
    funds or other products.

As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately 130 sales
    practices litigation matters pending against the Company. The
    Company continues to vigorously defend against the claims in
    these matters. Some sales practices claims have been resolved
    through settlement. Other sales practices claims have been won
    by dispositive motions or have gone to trial. Most of the
    current cases seek substantial damages, including in some cases
    punitive and treble damages and attorneys’ fees. Additional
    litigation relating to the Company’s marketing and sales of
    individual life insurance, mutual funds or other products may be
    commenced in the future.

Two putative class action lawsuits involving sales practices
    claims are pending against MLIC in Canada. In

Jacynthe
    Evoy-Larouche v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (Que. Super.
    Ct., filed March 1998)

, plaintiff alleges misrepresentations
    regarding dividends and future payments for life insurance
    policies and seeks unspecified damages. In

Ace Quan v.
    Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (Ont. Gen. Div., filed April
    1997)

, plaintiff alleges breach of contract and negligent
    misrepresentations relating to, among other things, life
    insurance premium payments and seeks damages, including punitive
    damages.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to MLIC’s, New
    England’s, GALIC’s, MSI’s or Walnut Street
    Securities’ sales of individual life insurance policies or
    annuities or other products. Over the past several years, these
    and a number of investigations by other regulatory authorities
    were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief.
    The Company may continue to resolve investigations in a similar
    manner. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in
    its consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for sales practices claims against
    MLIC, New England, GALIC, MSI and Walnut Street Securities.

Property
    and Casualty Actions

Katrina-Related Litigation.

There are a number
    of lawsuits, including a few putative class actions and
    “mass” actions, pending in Louisiana and Mississippi
    against Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company
    relating to Hurricane Katrina. The lawsuits include claims by
    policyholders for coverage for damages stemming from Hurricane
    Katrina, including for damages resulting from flooding or storm
    surge. The deadline for filing actions in Louisiana has expired.
    It is reasonably possible that additional actions will be filed
    in other states. The Company intends to continue to defend
    vigorously against these matters, although appropriate matters
    may be resolved as part of the ordinary claims adjustment
    process.

Shipley v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. and
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (Ill. Cir. Ct.,
    Madison County, filed February 26 and July 2,
    2003)

.  Two putative nationwide class actions have
    been filed against Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance
    Company in Illinois. One suit claims breach of contract and
    fraud due to the alleged underpayment of medical claims arising
    from the use of a purportedly biased provider fee pricing
    system. A motion for class certification has been filed and
    briefed. The second suit currently alleges breach of contract
    arising from the alleged use of preferred provider organizations
    to reduce medical provider fees covered by the medical claims
    portion of the insurance policy. A motion for class
    certification has been filed and briefed. A third putative
    nationwide class action relating to the payment of medical
    providers,

Innovative Physical Therapy, Inc. v. MetLife
    Auto & Home, et ano

(

D. N.J., filed
    November 12, 2007

) has been filed against Metropolitan
    Property and Casualty Insurance Company in federal court in New
    Jersey. The Company is vigorously defending against the claims
    in these matters.



Regulatory
    Matters

The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other
    inquiries from state regulators, including state insurance
    commissioners; state attorneys general or other state
    governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC;
    federal governmental authorities, including congressional
    committees; and FINRA seeking a broad range of information. The
    issues involved in information requests and regulatory matters
    vary widely. Certain regulators have requested information and
    documents regarding contingent commission payments to brokers,
    the Company’s awareness of any “sham” bids for
    business, bids and quotes that the Company submitted to
    potential customers, incentive agreements entered into with
    brokers, or compensation paid to intermediaries. Regulators also
    have requested information relating to market timing and late
    trading of mutual funds and variable insurance products and,
    generally, the marketing of products. The Company has received a
    subpoena from the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the
    Southern District of California asking for documents regarding
    the insurance broker Universal Life Resources. The Company has
    been cooperating fully with these inquiries.

In 2005, MSI received a notice from the Illinois Department of
    Securities asserting possible violations of the Illinois
    Securities Act in connection with sales of a former
    affiliate’s mutual funds. A response has been submitted and
    in January 2008, MSI received notice of the commencement of an
    administrative action by the Illinois Department of Securities.
    MSI intends to vigorously defend against the claims in this
    matter.

Other
    Litigation

In Re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig. (D. N.J., filed
    February 24, 2005).

In this multi-district
    proceeding, plaintiffs filed a class action complaint
    consolidating claims from several separate actions that had been
    filed in or transferred to the District of New Jersey in 2004
    and 2005. The consolidated complaint alleged that the Holding
    Company, MLIC, several non-affiliated insurance companies and
    several insurance brokers violated the Racketeer Influenced and
    Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), ERISA, and
    antitrust laws and committed other misconduct in the context of
    providing insurance to employee benefit plans and to persons who
    participate in such employee benefit plans. In August and
    September 2007, the court issued orders granting
    defendants’ motions to dismiss with prejudice the federal
    antitrust and the RICO claims. In January 2008, the court issued
    an order granting defendants’ summary judgment motion on
    the ERISA claims, and in February 2008, the court dismissed the
    remaining state law claims on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs
    have filed a notice of appeal of the court’s decisions. A
    putative class action alleging that the Holding Company and
    other non-affiliated defendants violated state laws was
    transferred to the District of New Jersey but was not
    consolidated with other related actions. Plaintiffs’ motion
    to remand this action to state court in Florida is pending.

The American Dental Association, et al. v. MetLife Inc., et
    al. (S.D. Fla., filed May 19, 2003)

.  The
    American Dental Association and three individual providers have
    sued the Holding Company, MLIC and other non-affiliated
    insurance companies in a putative class action lawsuit. The
    plaintiffs purport to represent a nationwide class of

in-network

providers who allege that their claims are being wrongfully
    reduced by downcoding, bundling, and the improper use and
    programming of software. The complaint alleges federal
    racketeering and various state law theories of liability. The
    district court has granted in part and denied in part the
    Company’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed an
    amended complaint, and the Company filed another motion to
    dismiss. The court has issued a

tag-along

order, related to a medical managed care trial, which has stayed
    the lawsuit.

Thomas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (W.D.
    Okla., filed January 31, 2007)

.  A putative
    class action complaint was filed against MLIC and MSI.
    Plaintiffs assert legal theories of violations of the federal
    securities laws and violations of state laws with respect to the
    sale of certain proprietary products by the Company’s
    agency distribution group. Plaintiffs seek rescission,
    compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees and expenses. The Company is vigorously
    defending against the claims in this matter.

MLIC also has been named as a defendant in a number of welding
    and mixed dust lawsuits filed in various state and federal
    courts. The Company is continuing to vigorously defend against
    these claims.

Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise
    provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, have arisen in the course of the Company’s
    business, including, but not limited to, in



connection with its activities as an insurer, employer,
    investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state
    insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state
    authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations
    concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable
    insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all
    pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses, except as noted
    previously in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to previously, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

For purposes of this discussion, “MetLife” or the
    “Company” refers to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). Following this
    summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of
    operations and financial condition of the Company for the
    periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with the forward-looking statement information included below,
    “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data”
    and the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    included elsewhere herein.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations contains statements which
    constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including
    statements relating to trends in the operations and financial
    results and the business and the products of MetLife, Inc. and
    its subsidiaries, as well as other statements including words
    such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “plan,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “intend” and other similar expressions.
    Forward-looking statements are made based upon management’s
    current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
    and their potential effects on the Company. Such forward-looking
    statements are not guarantees of future performance.

Actual results may differ materially from those included in the
    forward-looking statements as a result of risks and
    uncertainties including, but not limited to, the following:
    (i) changes in general economic conditions, including the
    performance of financial markets and interest rates, which may
    affect the Company’s ability to raise capital;
    (ii) heightened competition, including with respect to
    pricing, entry of new competitors, the development of new
    products by new and existing competitors and for personnel;
    (iii) investment losses and defaults, and changes to
    investment valuations; (iv) unanticipated changes in
    industry trends; (v) catastrophe losses;
    (vi) ineffectiveness of risk management policies and
    procedures; (vii) changes in accounting standards,
    practices

and/or

policies; (viii) changes in assumptions related to deferred
    policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business
    acquired (“VOBA”) or goodwill; (ix) discrepancies
    between actual claims experience and assumptions used in setting
    prices for the Company’s products and establishing the
    liabilities for the Company’s obligations for future policy
    benefits and claims; (x) discrepancies between actual
    experience and assumptions used in establishing liabilities
    related to other contingencies or obligations; (xi) adverse
    results or other consequences from litigation, arbitration or
    regulatory investigations; (xii) downgrades in the
    Company’s and its affiliates’ claims paying ability,
    financial strength or credit ratings; (xiii) regulatory,
    legislative or tax changes that may affect the cost of, or
    demand for, the Company’s products or services;
    (xiv) MetLife, Inc.’s primary reliance, as a holding
    company, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet debt payment
    obligations and the applicable regulatory restrictions on the
    ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends;
    (xv) deterioration in the experience of the “closed
    block” established in connection with the reorganization of
    MLIC; (xvi) economic, political, currency and other risks
    relating to the Company’s international operations;
    (xvii) the effects of business disruption or economic
    contraction due to terrorism or other hostilities;
    (xviii) the Company’s ability to identify and
    consummate on successful terms any future acquisitions, and to
    successfully integrate acquired businesses with minimal
    disruption; and (xix) other risks and uncertainties
    described from time to time in MetLife’s filings with the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

The Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update or
    revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
    information, future developments or otherwise.

Executive
    Summary

MetLife is a leading provider of insurance and other financial
    services with operations throughout the United States and
    the regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Through
    its domestic and international subsidiaries and affiliates,
    MetLife offers life insurance, annuities, automobile and
    homeowners insurance, retail banking and other financial
    services to individuals, as well as group insurance, reinsurance
    and retirement & savings products and services to
    corporations and other institutions. MetLife is organized into
    five operating segments: Institutional, Individual,
    Auto & Home, International and Reinsurance, as well as
    Corporate & Other.

The management’s discussion and analysis which follows
    isolates, in order to be meaningful, the results of the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from



Citigroup Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”) in the period over period
    comparison as the Travelers acquisition was not included in the
    results of the Company until July 1, 2005. The
    Travelers’ amounts which have been isolated represent the
    results of the Travelers legal entities which have been
    acquired. These amounts represent the impact of the Travelers
    acquisition; however, as business currently transacted through
    the acquired Travelers legal entities is transitioned to legal
    entities already owned by the Company, some of which has already
    occurred, the identification of the Travelers legal entity
    business will not necessarily be indicative of the impact of the
    Travelers acquisition on the results of the Company.

As a part of the Travelers acquisition, management realigned
    certain products and services within several of the
    Company’s segments to better conform to the way it manages
    and assesses its business. Accordingly, all prior period segment
    results have been adjusted to reflect such product
    reclassifications. Also in connection with the Travelers
    acquisition, management has utilized its economic capital model
    to evaluate the deployment of capital based upon the unique and
    specific nature of the risks inherent in the Company’s
    existing and newly acquired businesses and has adjusted such
    allocations based upon this model.

Year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2006

The Company reported $4,180 million in net income available
    to common shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of
    $5.48 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to
    $6,159 million in net income available to common
    shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of $7.99 for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income available to
    common shareholders decreased by $1,979 million, or 32%,
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the 2006
    period.

The decrease in net income available to common shareholders was
    primarily due to a decrease in income from discontinued
    operations of $3,185 million, net of income tax. This
    decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally
    driven by a gain of $3 billion, net of income tax, on the
    sale of the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties
    in Manhattan, New York, that was recognized during the year
    ended December 31, 2006. Also contributing to the decrease
    was lower net investment income and net investment gains
    (losses) from discontinued operations related to real estate
    properties sold or held-for-sale during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. In addition, there was lower income from
    discontinued operations related to the sale of MetLife Insurance
    Limited (“MetLife Australia”) annuities and pension
    businesses to a third party in the third quarter of 2007 and
    lower income from discontinued operations related to the sale of
    SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSRM”) resulting from a
    reduction in additional proceeds from the sale received during
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year
    December 31, 2006.

An increase in other expenses of $579 million, net of
    income tax, decreased net income available to common
    shareholders. The increase in other expenses was primarily due
    to higher DAC amortization resulting from business growth, lower
    net investment losses in the current year and the net impact of
    revisions to management’s assumption used to determine
    estimated gross profits and margins in both years. In addition,
    other expenses increased due to higher compensation, higher
    interest expense on debt and interest on tax contingencies,
    higher minority interest expense, the net impact of revisions to
    certain liabilities in both periods, asset write-offs, higher
    general spending and expenses related to growth initiatives,
    partially offset by lower legal costs and integration costs
    incurred in the prior year.

An increase in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances associated with an increase in the average policyholder
    account balance decreased net income available to common
    shareholders by $371 million, net of income tax.

Partially offsetting the decrease in net income available to
    common shareholders was an increase in net investment income of
    $1,251 million, net of income tax, primarily due to an
    increase in the average asset base and an increase in yields.
    Growth in the average asset base was primarily within fixed
    maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate joint ventures,
    and other limited partnership interests. Higher yields was
    primarily due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities,
    other limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds,
    equity securities and improved securities lending results,
    partially offset by lower returns on real estate joint ventures,
    cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, hedge funds
    and mortgage loans. Management anticipates that investment
    income and the related yields on other limited partnership
    interests may decline during 2008 due to increased volatility in
    the equity and credit markets during 2007.



Additionally, there was a decrease in net investment losses of
    $419 million, net of income tax, primarily due to a
    reduction of losses on fixed maturity securities resulting
    principally from the 2006 portfolio repositioning in a rising
    interest rate environment, increased gains from asset-based
    foreign currency transactions due to a decline in the
    U.S. dollar year over year against several major currencies
    and increased gains on equity securities, partially offset by
    increased losses from the mark-to-market on derivatives and
    reduced gains on real estate and real estate joint ventures.

The net effect of increases in premiums, fees and other revenues
    of $1,420 million, net of income tax, across all of the
    Company’s operating segments and increases in policyholder
    benefit and claims and policyholder dividends of
    $924 million, net of income tax, was attributable to
    overall business growth and increased net income available to
    common shareholders.

The remainder of the variance is due to the change in effective
    tax rates between periods.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005

The Company reported $6,159 million in net income available
    to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of
    $7.99 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to
    $4,651 million in net income available to common
    shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of $6.16 for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding the acquisition
    of Travelers, which contributed $317 million during the
    first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase, net
    income available to common shareholders increased by
    $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the 2005 period.

Income from discontinued operations consisted of net investment
    income and net investment gains related to real estate
    properties that the Company had classified as available-for-sale
    or had sold and, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the operations and gain upon disposal from the sale of
    SSRM on January 31, 2005 and for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the operations of P.T. Sejahtera
    (“MetLife Indonesia”) which was sold on
    September 29, 2005. Income from discontinued operations,
    net of income tax, increased by $1,579 million, or 96%, to
    $3,222 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $1,643 million for the comparable 2005 period. This
    increase was primarily due to a gain of $3 billion, net of
    income tax, on the sale of the Peter Cooper Village and
    Stuyvesant Town properties in Manhattan, New York, as well as a
    gain of $32 million, net of income tax, related to the sale
    of SSRM during the year ended December 31, 2006. This
    increase was partially offset by gains during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 including $1,193 million, net of
    income tax, on the sales of the One Madison Avenue and 200 Park
    Avenue properties in Manhattan, New York, as well as gains on
    the sales of SSRM and MetLife Indonesia of $177 million and
    $10 million, respectively, both net of income tax. In
    addition, there was lower net investment income and net
    investment gains from discontinued operations related to other
    real estate properties sold or held-for-sale during the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Net investment losses increased by $842 million, net of
    income tax, to a loss of $898 million, net of income tax,
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from a loss of
    $56 million, net of income tax, for the comparable 2005
    period. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers,
    which contributed a loss of $191 million, net of income
    tax, during the first six months of 2006 to the year over year
    increase, net investment losses increased by $651 million.
    The increase in net investment losses was due to a combination
    of losses from the mark-to-market on derivatives and foreign
    currency transaction losses during 2006, largely driven by
    increases in U.S. interest rates and the weakening of the
    dollar against the major currencies the Company hedges, notably
    the euro and pound sterling.

Dividends on the Holding Company’s Series A preferred
    shares and Series B preferred shares (“Preferred
    Shares”) issued in connection with financing the
    acquisition of Travelers increased by $71 million, to
    $134 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    from $63 million for the comparable 2005 period, as the
    preferred stock was issued in June 2005.

The remainder of the increase of $334 million in net income
    available to common shareholders for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the 2005 period was primarily
    due to an increase in premiums, fees and other revenues
    attributable to continued business growth across all of the
    Company’s operating segments. Also contributing to the
    increase was higher net investment income primarily due to an
    overall increase in the asset base, an increase in fixed
    maturity security yields, improved results on real estate and
    real estate joint ventures, mortgage



loans, and other limited partnership interests, as well as
    higher short-term interest rates on cash equivalents and
    short-term investments. These increases were partially offset by
    a decline in net investment income from securities lending
    results, and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees.
    Favorable underwriting results for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 were partially offset by a decrease in
    net interest margins. These increases were partially offset by
    an increase in expenses primarily due to higher interest expense
    on debt, increased general spending, higher compensation and
    commission costs and higher expenses related to growth
    initiatives and information technology projects, partially
    offset by a reduction in Travelers’ integration expenses,
    principally corporate incentives.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

On August 31, 2007, MetLife Australia completed the sale of
    its annuities and pension businesses to a third party for
    $25 million in cash consideration, resulting in a gain upon
    disposal of $41 million, net of income tax, which was
    adjusted in the fourth quarter of 2007 for additional
    transaction costs. The Company reclassified the assets and
    liabilities of the annuities and pension businesses within
    MetLife Australia, which is reported in the International
    segment, to assets and liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale
    and the operations of the business to discontinued operations
    for all periods presented. Included within the assets to be sold
    were certain fixed maturity securities in a loss position for
    which the Company recognized a net investment loss on a
    consolidated basis of $59 million, net of income tax, for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, because the Company no
    longer had the intent to hold such securities.

On June 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in a joint venture in Hong Kong, MetLife Fubon Limited
    (“MetLife Fubon”), for $56 million in cash,
    resulting in MetLife Fubon becoming a consolidated subsidiary of
    the Company. The transaction was treated as a step acquisition,
    and at June 30, 2007, total assets and liabilities of
    MetLife Fubon of $839 million and $735 million,
    respectively, were included in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet. The Company’s investment for the initial 50%
    interest in MetLife Fubon was $48 million. The Company used
    the equity method of accounting for such investment in MetLife
    Fubon. The Company’s share of the joint venture’s
    results for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was a loss
    of $3 million. The fair value of the assets acquired and
    the liabilities assumed in the step acquisition at June 30,
    2007, was $427 million and $371 million, respectively.
    No additional goodwill was recorded as a part of the step
    acquisition. As a result of this acquisition, additional VOBA
    and value of distribution agreements of $45 million and
    $5 million, respectively, were recorded and both have a
    weighted average amortization period of 16 years.

On June 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its
    Bermuda insurance subsidiary, MetLife International Insurance,
    Ltd. (“MLII”), to a third party for $33 million
    in cash consideration, resulting in a gain upon disposal of
    $3 million, net of income tax. The net assets of MLII at
    disposal were $27 million. A liability of $1 million
    was recorded with respect to a guarantee provided in connection
    with this disposition.

On September 29, 2005, the Company completed the sale of
    MetLife Indonesia to a third party, resulting in a gain upon
    disposal of $10 million, net of income tax. As a result of
    this sale, the Company recognized income (loss) from
    discontinued operations of $5 million, net of income tax,
    for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company
    reclassified the operations of MetLife Indonesia into
    discontinued operations for all years presented.

On September 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition
    of CitiStreet Associates, a division of CitiStreet LLC, which is
    primarily involved in the distribution of annuity products and
    retirement plans to the education, healthcare, and
    not-for-profit markets, for $56 million, of which
    $2 million was allocated to goodwill and $54 million
    to other identifiable intangibles, specifically the value of
    customer relationships acquired, which have a weighted average
    amortization period of 16 years. CitiStreet Associates was
    integrated with MetLife Resources, a focused distribution
    channel of MetLife, which is dedicated to provide retirement
    plans and financial services to the same markets.

On July 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Travelers for $12.1 billion. The results of Travelers’
    operations were included in the Company’s financial
    statements beginning July 1, 2005. As a result of the
    acquisition, management of the Company increased significantly
    the size and scale of the Company’s core insurance and
    annuity products and expanded the Company’s presence in
    both the retirement & savings’ domestic



and international markets. The distribution agreements executed
    with Citigroup as part of the acquisition provide the Company
    with one of the broadest distribution networks in the industry.

The initial consideration paid in 2005 by the Company for the
    acquisition consisted of $10.9 billion in cash and
    22,436,617 shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock with a market value of $1.0 billion to Citigroup and
    $100 million in other transaction costs. Additional
    consideration of $115 million was paid by the Holding
    Company to Citigroup in 2006 as a result of the finalization by
    both parties of their review of the June 30, 2005 financial
    statements and final resolution as to the interpretation of the
    provisions of the acquisition agreement. In addition to cash
    on-hand, the purchase price was financed through the issuance of
    common stock, debt securities, common equity units and preferred
    stock. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    Sources.”

On January 31, 2005, the Company completed the sale of SSRM
    to a third party for $328 million in cash and stock. The
    Company reported the operations of SSRM in discontinued
    operations. Under the terms of the sale agreement, MetLife will
    have an opportunity to receive additional payments based on,
    among other things, certain revenue retention and growth
    measures. The purchase price is also subject to reduction over
    five years, depending on retention of certain MetLife-related
    business. Also under the terms of such agreement, MetLife had
    the opportunity to receive additional consideration for the
    retention of certain customers for a specific period in 2005.
    Upon finalization of the computation, the Company received
    payments of $30 million, net of income tax, in the second
    quarter of 2006 and $12 million, net of income tax, in the
    fourth quarter of 2005 due to the retention of these specific
    customer accounts. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company
    received a payment of $16 million, net of income tax, as a
    result of the revenue retention and growth measure provision in
    the sales agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company
    accrued a liability for $2 million, net of income tax,
    related to the termination of certain MetLife-related business.
    In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company eliminated
    $4 million of a liability that was previously recorded with
    respect to the indemnities provided in connection with the sale
    of SSRM, resulting in a benefit to the Company of
    $2 million, net of income tax. The Company believes that
    future payments relating to these indemnities are not probable.

See “— Subsequent Events” for information on
    the Company’s acquisitions subsequent to December 31, 2007.

Industry
    Trends

The Company’s segments continue to be influenced by a
    variety of trends that affect the industry.

Financial and Economic Environment.

During
    2007, the global capital markets reassessed the credit risk
    inherent in sub-prime mortgages. This reassessment led to a
    fairly broad repricing of all credit risk assets and strained
    market liquidity. Global central banks intervened to stabilize
    market conditions and protect against downside risks to economic
    growth. Still, market and economic conditions continued to
    deteriorate. The economic community’s consensus outlook of
    global economic growth is lower for calendar year 2008, with a
    sizable minority of economists forecasting a recessionary
    environment. The global capital markets have adjusted towards
    this consensus outlook, with interest rates and equity prices
    falling and risk spreads widening. Slow growth and recessionary
    periods are often associated with declining asset prices, lower
    interest rates, credit rating agency downgrades and increasing
    default losses. The global capital markets are also less liquid
    now than in more normal environments. Liquidity conditions
    impact the cost of purchasing and selling assets and, at times,
    the ability to purchase or sell assets. These adjustments in the
    global capital markets have also resulted in higher realized and
    expected volatility.

As expectations for global economic growth are lowered, factors
    such as consumer spending, business investment, government
    spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets,
    and inflation all affect the business and economic environment
    and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of the business we
    conduct. In an economic downturn characterized by higher
    unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings,
    lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the
    demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely
    affected. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings
    negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.



Demographics.

In the coming decade, a key
    driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will
    be the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and needs
    of the retiring Baby Boomers. As a result of increasing
    longevity, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings
    to finance retirements that may span 30 or more years. Helping
    the Baby Boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and
    subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income
    represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry.

Life insurers are well positioned to address the Baby
    Boomers’ rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for
    income protection. The Company believes that, among life
    insurers, those with strong brands, high financial strength
    ratings and broad distribution, are best positioned to
    capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection
    products to Baby Boomers.

Moreover, the life insurance industry’s products and the
    needs they are designed to address are complex. The Company
    believes that individuals approaching retirement age will need
    to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements and
    that, in the workplace, as employees take greater responsibility
    for their benefit options and retirement planning, they will
    need information about their possible individual needs. One of
    the challenges for the life insurance industry will be the
    delivery of this information in a cost effective manner.

Competitive Pressures.

The life insurance
    industry remains highly competitive. The product development and
    product life-cycles have shortened in many product segments,
    leading to more intense competition with respect to product
    features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand
    equity, product development, technology and risk management,
    which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth
    in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the
    industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to
    intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength
    and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for
    sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market
    participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional
    distribution capability and the information technology needed to
    offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly
    sophisticated industry client base.

Regulatory Changes.

The life insurance
    industry is regulated at the state level, with some products and
    services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers
    introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine
    capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for
    the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or
    currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and
    capital requirements of the industry. In addition, regulators
    have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several
    markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities,
    variable annuities and group products.

Pension Plans.

On August 17, 2006,
    President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (“PPA”) into law. The PPA is considered to be the most
    sweeping pension legislation since the adoption of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) on
    September 2, 1974. The provisions of the PPA may, over
    time, have a significant impact on demand for pension,
    retirement savings, and lifestyle protection products in both
    the institutional and retail markets. The impact of the
    legislation may have a positive effect on the life insurance and
    financial services industries in the future.

Impact of
    Hurricanes

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the
    states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, causing
    catastrophic damage to these coastal regions. MetLife’s
    cumulative gross losses from Hurricane Katrina were
    $314 million, $333 million and $335 million at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily
    arising from the Company’s homeowners business. During the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    recognized net losses, net of income tax and reinsurance
    recoverables and including reinstatement premiums and other
    reinsurance-related premium adjustments related to the
    catastrophe, of ($13) million, ($2) million and
    $134 million, respectively.

On October 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma made landfall across
    the state of Florida. MetLife’s cumulative gross losses
    from Hurricane Wilma were $66 million, $64 million and
    $57 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, primarily arising from the Company’s
    homeowners and automobile businesses. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s
    Auto & Home segment recognized net losses, net of
    income



tax and reinsurance recoverables, of ($3) million and
    $32 million, respectively, related to Hurricane Wilma. The
    Company did not recognize any loss during the year ended
    December 31, 2007, related to Hurricane Wilma.

Additional hurricane-related losses may be recorded in future
    periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to
    reinsurers are processed. Reinsurance recoveries are dependent
    upon the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers, which may
    be affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and otherwise. In addition,
    lawsuits, including purported class actions, have been filed in
    Louisiana and Mississippi challenging denial of claims for
    damages caused to property during Hurricane Katrina.
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company is a named
    party in some of these lawsuits. In addition, rulings in cases
    in which Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company is
    not a party may affect interpretation of its policies.
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company intends to
    vigorously defend these matters. However, any adverse rulings
    could result in an increase in the Company’s
    hurricane-related claim exposure and losses. Based on
    information known by management, it does not believe that
    additional claim losses resulting from Hurricane Katrina will
    have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Summary
    of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. The most critical estimates include those used in
    determining:

(i)

the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market
    values;

(ii)

investment impairments;

(iii)

the recognition of income on certain investments;

(iv)

the application of the consolidation rules to certain
    investments;

(v)

the fair value of and accounting for derivatives;

(vi)

the capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment
    and amortization of VOBA;

(vii)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

(viii)

the liability for future policyholder benefits;

(ix)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

(x)

accounting for reinsurance transactions;

(xi)

accounting for employee benefit plans; and

(xii)

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

The application of purchase accounting requires the use of
    estimation techniques in determining the fair values of assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed — the most
    significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical
    estimates. In applying these policies, management makes
    subjective and complex judgments that frequently require
    estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of
    these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in
    the insurance and financial services industries; others are
    specific to the Company’s businesses and operations. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Investments

The Company’s principal investments are in fixed maturity
    and equity securities, mortgage and consumer loans, policy
    loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnerships, short-term investments, and other invested assets.
    The Company’s investments are exposed to three primary
    sources of risk: credit, interest rate and market valuation. The
    financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks,
    are those associated with the determination of fair values, the
    recognition of impairments, the recognition of income on certain
    investments, and the potential consolidation of previously
    unconsolidated subsidiaries.



The Company’s investments in fixed maturity and equity
    securities are classified as available-for-sale, except for
    trading securities, and are reported at their estimated fair
    value. The fair values for public fixed maturity securities and
    public equity securities are based on quoted market prices or
    estimates from independent pricing services. However, in cases
    where quoted market prices are not available, such as for
    private fixed maturities, fair values are estimated using
    present value or valuation techniques. The determination of fair
    values in the absence of quoted market prices is based on:
    (i) valuation methodologies; (ii) securities the
    Company deems to be comparable; and (iii) assumptions
    deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The fair value
    estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
    available market information and judgments about financial
    instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of
    expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer
    or counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value
    include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call
    provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry
    sector of the issuer, and quoted market prices of comparable
    securities. The use of different methodologies and assumptions
    may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

One of the significant estimates related to available-for-sale
    securities is the evaluation of investments for
    other-than-temporary impairments. The assessment of whether
    impairments have occurred is based on management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair
    value. The Company’s review of its fixed maturity and
    equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the
    total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%;
    (ii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for
    less than six months; and (iii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater.
    Additionally, management considers a wide range of factors about
    the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions
    and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the
    impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to:

(i)

the length of time and the extent to which the market value has
    been below cost or amortized cost;

(ii)

the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties;

(iii)

the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or
    sub-sector;

(iv)

the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed
    geographic locations;

(v)

the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer,
    series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type
    of loss or has exhausted natural resources;

(vi)

the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value
    to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost;

(vii)

unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed
    and asset-backed securities; and

(viii)

other subjective factors, including concentrations and
    information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

The cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for
    impairments in value deemed to be other-than-temporary in the
    period in which the determination is made. These impairments are
    included within net investment gains (losses) and the cost basis
    of the fixed maturity and equity securities is reduced
    accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis
    for subsequent recoveries in value.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on
    other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based
    upon the Company’s periodic evaluation and assessment of
    known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset
    class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as
    conditions change and new information becomes available.
    Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects
    changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such
    evaluations are revised.



The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain investment transactions,
    trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market conditions,
    which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be
    earned.

Additionally, when the Company enters into certain structured
    investment transactions, real estate joint ventures and other
    limited partnerships for which the Company may be deemed to be
    the primary beneficiary under Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46(r),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — An Interpretation of ARB No. 51

,
    it may be required to consolidate such investments. The
    accounting rules for the determination of the primary
    beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the
    contractual rights and obligations associated with each party
    involved in the entity, an estimate of the entity’s
    expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation
    of such estimates to each party.

The use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the
    determination of the fair value of investments, the timing and
    amount of impairments, the recognition of income, or
    consolidation of investments may have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company enters into freestanding derivative transactions
    including swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. The
    Company uses derivatives primarily to manage various risks. The
    risks being managed are variability in cash flows or changes in
    fair values related to financial instruments and currency
    exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign
    operations. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit
    derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to synthetically
    replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily
    available in the cash market. The Company also purchases certain
    securities, issues certain insurance policies and engages in
    certain reinsurance contracts that have embedded derivatives.

Fair value of derivatives is determined by quoted market prices
    or through the use of pricing models. The determination of fair
    value, when quoted market values are not available, is based on
    valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate under
    the circumstances. Derivative valuations can be affected by
    changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, market volatility, and
    liquidity. Values can also be affected by changes in estimates
    and assumptions used in pricing models. Such assumptions include
    estimates of volatility, interest rates, foreign currency
    exchange rates, other financial indices and credit ratings.
    Essential to the analysis of the fair value is risk of
    counterparty default. The use of different assumptions may have
    a material effect on the estimated derivative fair value
    amounts, as well as the amount of reported net income. Also,
    fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives which have not
    been designated for hedge accounting may result in significant
    volatility in net income.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under these accounting standards. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported. Measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging
    relationships are also subject to interpretations and
    estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have
    a material effect on the amount reported in net income.

Additionally, there is a risk that embedded derivatives
    requiring bifurcation may not be identified and reported at fair
    value in the consolidated financial statements and that their
    related changes in fair value could materially affect reported
    net income.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issue expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    reflects the estimated fair



value of in-force contracts in a life insurance company
    acquisition and represents the portion of the purchase price
    that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future
    cash flows from the business in-force at the acquisition date.
    VOBA is based on actuarially determined projections, by each
    block of business, of future policy and contract charges,
    premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance,
    surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns and other
    factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary
    from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial statements for
    reporting purposes.

DAC for property and casualty insurance contracts, which is
    primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance or investment-type contracts are
    amortized in proportion to gross premiums, gross margins or
    gross profits, depending on the type of contract as described
    below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, non-medical health
    insurance, and traditional group life insurance) over the entire
    premium paying period in proportion to the present value of
    actual historic and expected future gross premiums. The present
    value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement
    of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity,
    persistency, and investment returns at policy issuance, or
    policy acquisition, as it relates to VOBA, that include
    provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the
    assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit
    liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy
    issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed
    to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a
    premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy
    issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium
    volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties, and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts (dividend paying
    traditional contracts within the closed block) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency, and other factor
    changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely
    to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization.
    Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross
    margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the
    actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross
    margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is
    re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to
    current operations. When actual gross margins exceed those
    previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will
    increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The
    opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below
    the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period,
    the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force,
    which impacts expected future gross margins.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future
    gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of
    the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency,
    interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of
    any hedges used, and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that
    investment returns, expenses, and persistency are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that
    period. When the actual gross profits change from previously
    estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA
    amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge
    or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits
    exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are
    below the previously estimated gross profits.



Each reporting period, the Company also updates the actual
    amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected
    future gross profits.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period. Returns that are higher than the Company’s
    long-term expectation produce higher account balances, which
    increases the Company’s future fee expectations and
    decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death
    benefit guarantees, resulting in higher expected future gross
    profits. The opposite result occurs when returns are lower than
    the Company’s long-term expectation. The Company’s
    practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from
    returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation
    in equity markets is not changed by short-term market
    fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim
    deviations are expected. The Company monitors these changes and
    only changes the assumption when its long-term expectation
    changes. The effect of an increase/(decrease) by 100 basis
    points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely
    to result in a decrease/(increase) in the DAC and VOBA balances
    of approximately $95 million with an offset to the
    Company’s unearned revenue liability of approximately
    $20 million for this factor.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation
    of estimated gross margins and profits which may have
    significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Over the past two years, the Company’s most significant
    assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future
    gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA
    have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment
    returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and
    policyholder dividends on contracts included within the
    Individual segment. The Company expects these assumptions to be
    the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in
    the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and
    the Company is unable to predict their movement or offsetting
    impact over time.

The following chart illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA
    within the Company’s Individual segment of changing each of
    the respective assumptions during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006:

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, DAC and VOBA for the

    $21.5 billion and $20.8 billion, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
    acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment
    at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances,
    such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that
    there may be justification for conducting an interim test.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of
    goodwill impairment testing, goodwill within
    Corporate & Other is allocated to reporting units



within the Company’s business segments. If the carrying
    value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair
    value, the excess is recognized as an impairment and recorded as
    a charge against net income. The fair values of the reporting
    units are determined using a market multiple, a discounted cash
    flow model, or a cost approach. The critical estimates necessary
    in determining fair value are projected earnings, comparative
    market multiples and the discount rate.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    expected future benefits to be paid, reduced by the present
    value of expected future premiums. Such liabilities are
    established based on methods and underlying assumptions in
    accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards.
    Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities
    for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy
    lapse, renewal, retirement, investment returns, inflation,
    expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the
    respective product type. These assumptions are established at
    the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the
    experience for the period the policy benefits are payable.
    Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a
    block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than
    assumptions, additional liabilities may be required, resulting
    in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.

Liabilities for future policy benefits for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Other policyholder funds include claims that have been
    reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on
    life and non-medical health insurance. Liabilities for unpaid
    claims are estimated based upon the Company’s historical
    experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the
    effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk
    management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and
    subrogation. The effects of changes in such estimated
    liabilities are included in the results of operations in the
    period in which the changes occur.

Future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income
    benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and
    secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life
    policies are based on estimates of the expected value of
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal
    and variable life secondary guarantees and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent
    with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the
    same variability and risk.

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders. These include guaranteed
    minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) riders and
    guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”)
    riders. GMWB and GMAB riders are embedded derivatives, which are
    measured at fair value separately from the host variable annuity
    contract, with changes in fair value reported in net investment
    gains (losses). The fair values of GMWB and GMAB riders are
    calculated based on actuarial and capital market assumptions
    related to the projected cash flows, including benefits and
    related contract charges, over the lives of the contracts,
    incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior.
    These riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or
    declining markets, causing an increase in liabilities for future
    policy benefits, negatively affecting net income.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies, guarantees and
    riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities
    result in variances in profit and could result in losses. The
    effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in
    the results of operations in the period in which the changes
    occur.



Income
    Taxes

Income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the
    Company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing
    jurisdictions in connection with its operations. The Company
    provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently
    payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities. The Company’s accounting for income taxes
    represents management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The
    realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of
    sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward
    periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction.
    Valuation allowances are established when management determines,
    based on available information, that it is more likely than not
    that deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
    Significant judgment is required in determining whether
    valuation allowances should be established, as well as the
    amount of such allowances. When making such determination,
    consideration is given to, among other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company may be required to change its provision for income
    taxes in certain circumstances. Examples of such circumstances
    include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is
    challenged by taxing authorities or when estimates used in
    determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets
    significantly change or when receipt of new information
    indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances.
    Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax
    regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations,
    could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the
    effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect
    the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in
    the year these changes occur.

As described more fully in “— Adoption of New
    Accounting Pronouncements”, the Company adopted
    FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

(“FIN 48”) effective
    January 1, 2007. Under FIN 48, the Company determines
    whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities
    before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial
    statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
    realized upon settlement.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a
    provider and a purchaser of reinsurance for its life and
    property and casualty insurance products. Accounting for
    reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates,
    particularly related to the future performance of the underlying
    business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks.
    The Company periodically reviews actual and anticipated
    experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to
    establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed
    reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of
    counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria
    similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process
    discussed previously. Additionally, for each of its reinsurance
    contracts, the Company determines if the contract provides
    indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance
    risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The
    Company reviews all contractual features, particularly those
    that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the
    reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely
    reimbursement of claims. If the Company determines that a
    reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a
    reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance
    risk, the Company records the contract using the deposit method
    of accounting.



Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer pension and other postretirement plans covering
    employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The
    obligations and expenses associated with these plans require an
    extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected
    rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation
    increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions
    regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of
    retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. Management, in
    consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm,
    determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors
    such as historical performance of the plan and its assets,
    currently available market and industry data, and expected
    benefit payout streams. The assumptions used may differ
    materially from actual results due to, among other factors,
    changing market and economic conditions and changes in
    participant demographics. These differences may have a
    significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and liquidity.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including
    the Company’s asbestos-related liability, are especially
    difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data
    and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect
    liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the
    assumptions used to estimate the Company’s asbestos-related
    liability include the number of future claims, the cost to
    resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in
    pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new
    claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the
    law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible
    impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to
    allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the Company when
    exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos
    exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future
    adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual
    basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to
    liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and
    litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. It is possible
    that an adverse outcome in certain of the Company’s
    litigation and regulatory investigations, including
    asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in
    the determination of amounts recorded could have a material
    effect upon the Company’s consolidated net income or cash
    flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Economic
    Capital

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in MetLife’s businesses. As a part of the
    economic capital process, a portion of net investment income is
    credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity.
    This is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk-based
    capital (“RBC”) formula, which is not as refined in
    its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the
    Company’s businesses.

The increase in the International segment’s income from
    continuing operations was primarily attributable to the
    following factors:

•

An increase in Argentina’s income from continuing
    operations primarily due to a net reduction of liabilities
    resulting from pension reform, a reduction in claim liabilities
    resulting from experience reviews in both the current and prior
    years, higher premiums resulting from higher pension
    contributions attributable to higher participant salaries,
    higher net investment income resulting from capital
    contributions in the prior year, and a smaller increase in
    market indexed policyholder liabilities without a corresponding
    decrease in net investment income, partially offset by the
    reduction of cost of insurance fees as a result of the new
    pension system reform regulation, an increase in retention
    incentives related to pension reform, as well as lower trading
    portfolio income. Argentina also benefited, in both the current
    and prior years, from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards
    against which valuation allowances had been previously
    established.

•

Mexico’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily due to a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities
    caused by a decrease in the unrealized investment results on
    invested assets supporting those liabilities relative to the
    prior year, the favorable impact of experience refunds during
    the first quarter of 2007, a reduction in claim liabilities
    resulting from an experience review and the unfavorable impact
    in the prior year resulting from an adjustment to experience
    refunds in its institutional business, a year over year decrease
    in DAC amortization resulting from management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits in both
    the current and prior years, a decrease in liabilities based on
    a review of outstanding remittances, and growth in its
    institutional and universal life businesses. These increases in
    Mexico’s income from continuing operations were partially
    offset by lower fees resulting from management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits, the
    favorable impact in the prior year associated with a large group
    policy that was not renewed, a decrease in various one-time
    revenue items, lower investment yields, the favorable impact in
    the prior year of liabilities related to employment matters that
    were reduced, and the benefit in the prior year from the
    elimination of liabilities for pending claims determined to be
    invalid.

•

Taiwan’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily driven by an increase due to higher DAC amortization
    in the prior year resulting from a loss recognition adjustment
    and restructuring costs, partially offset by the favorable
    impact of liability refinements in the prior year, as well as
    higher policyholder liabilities related to loss recognition in
    the fourth quarter of 2006.

•

Brazil’s income from continuing operations increased due to
    the unfavorable impact of increases in policyholder liabilities
    due to higher than expected mortality on specific blocks of
    business and an increase in litigation liabilities in the prior
    year, the unfavorable impact of the reversal of a tax credit in
    the prior year, as well as growth of the in-force business.

•

Ireland’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses for
    which a valuation allowance had been previously established,
    higher investment income, partially offset by higher

start-up

expenses and currency transaction losses.

•

Japan’s income from continuing operations increased due to
    improved hedge results and business growth, partially offset by
    the impact of foreign currency transaction losses.

•

Hong Kong’s income from continuing operations increased due
    to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife
    Fubon and the resulting consolidation of the operation, as well
    as business growth.

•

Chile’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily due to growth of the in-force business, higher joint
    venture income and higher returns on inflation indexed
    securities, partially offset by higher compensation,
    infrastructure and marketing expenses.

•

Income from continuing operations increased in the United
    Kingdom due to a reduction of claim liabilities resulting from
    an experience review, offset by an unearned premium calculation
    refinement.

•

Australia’s income from continuing operations increased due
    to growth of the in-force business and changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates.



•

These increases in income from continuing operations were
    partially offset by a decrease in the home office due to higher
    economic capital charges and investment expenses, an increase in
    contingent tax expenses in the current year, as well as higher
    spending due to growth and initiatives, partially offset by the
    elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously charged
    to the International segment, and a tax benefit associated with
    a prior year income tax expense related to a revision of an
    estimate.

•

India’s income from continuing operations decreased
    primarily due to headcount increases and growth initiatives, as
    well as the impact of valuation allowances established against
    losses in both years.

•

South Korea’s income from continuing operations decreased
    due to a favorable impact in the prior year associated with the
    implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system, as
    well as additional expenses in the current year associated with
    growth and infrastructure initiatives, partially offset by
    continued growth and lower DAC amortization, both in the
    variable universal life business.

The Institutional segment’s income from continuing
    operations increased primarily due to lower net investment
    losses, an increase in interest margins, an increase in
    underwriting results, the impact of revisions to certain
    expenses in both periods, partially offset by higher expenses
    due to an increase in non-deferrable volume-related and
    corporate support expenses and an increase in DAC amortization
    resulting from the ongoing implementation of Statement of
    Position

(“‘SOP”) 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

(“SOP 05-1”)

in the current year.

Corporate & Other’s income from continuing
    operations increased primarily due to higher net investment
    income, lower net investment losses, lower corporate expenses,
    higher other revenues, integration costs incurred in the prior
    year, and lower legal costs, partially offset by a decrease in
    tax benefits, higher interest expense on debt, higher interest
    on tax contingencies, and higher interest credited to bankholder
    deposits.

The Individual segment’s income from continuing operations
    increased primarily due to a decrease in net investment losses,
    higher fee income from separate account products, higher net
    investment income on blocks of business not driven by interest
    margins and an increase in interest margins, partially offset by
    higher DAC amortization, unfavorable underwriting results in
    life products, higher general expenses, the impact of revisions
    to certain liabilities in both years, the write-off of a
    receivable in the current year, an increase in the closed
    block-related policyholder dividend obligation, higher annuity
    benefits, an increase in policyholder dividends and an increase
    in interest credited to policyholder account balances.

The Auto & Home segment’s income from continuing
    operations increased primarily due to an increase in premiums
    and other revenues, an increase in net investment income, an
    increase in net investment gains and a decrease in other
    expenses. These were partially offset by losses related to
    higher claim frequencies, higher earned exposures, higher losses
    due to severity, an increase in unallocated claims adjusting
    expenses and an increase from a reduction in favorable
    development of prior year losses, partially offset by a decrease
    in catastrophe losses, which included favorable development of
    prior year catastrophe reserves, all of which are related to
    policyholder benefits and claims. Also offsetting the increase
    in income from continuing operations was a decrease in average
    earned premium per policy and an increase in catastrophe
    reinsurance costs.

The Reinsurance segment’s income from continuing operations
    increased primarily due to an increase in premiums due to
    additional business in-force from facultative and automatic
    treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business, an
    increase in net investment income due to growth in the asset
    base, an increase in other revenues and a decrease in other
    expenses, partially offset by an increase in net investment
    losses which was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value
    of embedded derivatives associated with the reinsurance of
    annuity products on a funds withheld basis.

Revenues
    and Expenses

Premiums,
    Fees and Other Revenues

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $2,185 million, or 7%, to $34,739 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $32,554 million for the
    comparable 2006 period.

The growth in the Institutional segment was primarily due to
    increases in the non-medical health & other and group
    life businesses. The non-medical health & other
    business increased primarily due to growth in the dental,
    disability, accidental death & dismemberment
    (“AD&D”) and individual disability insurance
    (“IDI”) businesses. Partially offsetting these
    increases is a decrease in the long-term care (“LTC”)
    business, net of a decrease resulting from a shift to deposit
    liability-type contracts in the current year, partially offset
    by growth in the business. The group life business increased
    primarily due to business growth in term life and increases in
    corporate-owned life insurance and life insurance sold to
    postretirement benefit plans. These increases in the non-medical
    health & other and group life businesses were
    partially offset by a decrease in the retirement &
    savings business. The decrease in retirement & savings
    was primarily due to a decrease in structured settlement and
    pension closeout premiums, partially offset by an increase in
    other products.

The growth in the Reinsurance segment was primarily attributable
    to premiums from new facultative and automatic treaties and
    renewal premiums on existing blocks of business in all
    RGA’s operating segments. In addition, other revenues
    increased due to an increase in surrender charges on
    asset-intensive business reinsured and an increase in fees
    associated with financial reinsurance.

The growth in the International segment was primarily due to the
    following factors:

•

An increase in Mexico’s premiums, fees and other revenues
    due to higher fees and growth in its institutional and universal
    life businesses, a decrease in experience refunds during the
    first quarter of 2007 on Mexico’s institutional business,
    as well as the adverse impact in the prior year of an adjustment
    for experience refunds on Mexico’s institutional business,
    offset by lower fees resulting from management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    various one-time revenue items which benefited both the current
    and prior years.

•

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in Hong Kong
    primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest
    in MetLife Fubon and the resulting consolidation of the
    operation as well as business growth.

•

Chile’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to higher annuity sales, higher institutional
    premiums from its traditional and bank distribution channels,
    and the decrease in the prior year resulting from
    management’s decision not to match aggressive pricing in
    the marketplace.

•

South Korea’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to higher fees from growth in its guaranteed
    annuity and variable universal life businesses.

•

Brazil’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased due to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and business growth.

•

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in Japan due to an
    increase in reinsurance assumed.

•

Australia’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to growth in the institutional and reinsurance
    business in-force, an increase in retention levels and changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates.



•

Argentina’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased due
    to higher pension contributions resulting from higher
    participant salaries and a higher salary threshold subject to
    fees and growth in bancassurance, offset by the reduction of
    cost of insurance fees as a result of the new pension system
    reform regulation.

•

Taiwan’s and India’s premiums, fees and other revenues
    increased primarily due to business growth.

These increases in premiums, fees and other revenues were
    partially offset by a decrease in the United Kingdom due to an
    unearned premium calculation refinement, partially offset by
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The growth in the Individual segment was primarily due to higher
    fee income from variable life and annuity and investment-type
    products and growth in premiums from other life products,
    partially offset by a decrease in immediate annuity premiums and
    a decline in premiums associated with the Company’s closed
    block business, in line with expectations.

The growth in the Auto & Home segment was primarily
    due to an increase in premiums related to increased exposures,
    an increase in various voluntary and involuntary programs, and a
    change in estimate on auto rate refunds due to a regulatory
    examination, as well as an increase in other revenues primarily
    due to slower than anticipated claim payments in 2006. These
    increases were partially offset by a reduction in average earned
    premium per policy, and an increase in catastrophe reinsurance
    costs.

The increase in Corporate & Other was primarily
    related to the resolution of an indemnification claim associated
    with the 2000 acquisition of General American Life Insurance
    Company (“GALIC”), partially offset by an adjustment
    of surrender values on corporate-owned life insurance policies.

Net
    Investment Income

Net investment income increased by $1,924 million, or 11%,
    to $19,006 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007 from $17,082 million for the comparable 2006 period.
    Management attributes $1,336 million of this increase to
    growth in the average asset base and $588 million to an
    increase in yields. The increase in net investment income from
    growth in the average asset base was primarily within fixed
    maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate joint ventures
    and other limited partnership interests. The increase in net
    investment income attributable to higher yields was primarily
    due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities, other
    limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds, equity
    securities and improved securities lending results, partially
    offset by lower returns on real estate joint ventures, cash,
    cash equivalents and short-term investments, hedge funds and
    mortgage loans. Management anticipates that investment income
    and the related yields on other limited partnership interests
    may decline during 2008 due to increased volatility in the
    equity and credit markets during 2007.

Interest
    Margin

Interest margin, which represents the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to policyholder account
    balances increased in the Institutional and Individual segments
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the
    prior year. Interest earned approximates net investment income
    on investable assets attributed to the segment with minor
    adjustments related to the consolidation of certain separate
    accounts and other minor non-policyholder elements. Interest
    credited is the amount attributed to insurance products,
    recorded in policyholder benefits and claims, and the amount
    credited to policyholder account balances for investment-type
    products, recorded in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances. Interest credited on insurance products reflects the
    current year impact of the interest rate assumptions established
    at issuance or acquisition. Interest credited to policyholder
    account balances is subject to contractual terms, including some
    minimum guarantees. This tends to move gradually over time to
    reflect market interest rate movements and may reflect actions
    by management to respond to competitive pressures and,
    therefore, generally does not introduce volatility in expense.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses)

Net investment losses decreased by $644 million to a loss
    of $738 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from a loss of $1,382 million for the comparable 2006
    period. The decrease in net investment losses was



primarily due to a reduction of losses on fixed maturity
    securities resulting principally from the 2006 portfolio
    repositioning in a rising interest rate environment, increased
    gains from asset-based foreign currency transactions due to a
    decline in the U.S. dollar year over year against several
    major currencies and increased gains on equity securities,
    partially offset by increased losses from the mark-to-market on
    derivatives and reduced gains on real estate and real estate
    joint ventures.

Underwriting

Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity or other insurance costs, less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity or
    other insurance-related experience trends, as well as the
    reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business.
    Consequently, results can fluctuate from period to period.
    Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were less favorable for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, as the combined ratio, excluding
    catastrophes, increased to 86.3% from 82.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Underwriting results were favorable in
    the non-medical health & other, group life and
    retirement & savings businesses in the Institutional
    segment. Underwriting results were unfavorable in the life
    products in the Individual segment.

Other
    Expenses

Other expenses increased by $890 million, or 8%, to
    $11,673 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $10,783 million for the comparable 2006 period.

The Individual segment contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to higher DAC
    amortization, higher expenses associated with business growth,
    information technology and other general expenses, the impact of
    revisions to certain liabilities, including pension and
    postretirement liabilities and policyholder liabilities in the
    prior year, and a write-off of a receivable in the current year.

The International segment contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to the business growth
    commensurate with the increase in revenues discussed above. It
    was driven by the following factors:

•

Argentina’s other expenses increased primarily due to a
    liability for servicing obligations that was established as a
    result of pension reform, an increase in commissions on
    bancassurance business, an increase in retention incentives
    related to pension reform, and the impact of management’s
    update of DAC assumptions as a result of pension reform and
    growth, partially offset by a lower increase in liabilities due
    to inflation and exchange rate indexing.

•

South Korea’s other expenses increased primarily due to the
    favorable impact in DAC amortization associated with the
    implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system in the
    prior year, additional expenses associated with growth and
    infrastructure initiatives, as well as business growth and
    higher bank insurance fees, partially offset by a decrease in
    DAC amortization.



•

Mexico’s other expenses increased due to higher expenses
    related to business growth and the favorable impact in the prior
    year of liabilities that were reduced, offset by a decrease in
    DAC amortization resulting from management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits in both
    the current and prior years and a decrease in liabilities based
    on a review of outstanding remittances.

•

Other expenses increased in India primarily due to headcount
    increases and growth initiatives, partially offset by the impact
    of management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits.

•

Other expenses increased in Australia primarily due to business
    growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Other expenses increased in Chile primarily due to compensation
    costs, infrastructure and marketing programs, and growth
    partially offset by a decrease in DAC amortization related to
    inflation indexing.

•

Other expenses increased in Hong Kong due to the acquisition of
    the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Ireland’s other expenses increased due to higher

start-up

costs, as well as foreign currency transaction losses.

•

Brazil’s other expenses increased due to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates partially offset by an increase in
    litigation liabilities in the prior year.

•

The United Kingdom’s other expenses increased due to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher spending
    on business initiatives partially offset by lower DAC
    amortization resulting from calculation refinements.

•

These increases in other expenses were partially offset by a
    decrease in Taiwan’s other expenses primarily due to a
    one-time increase in DAC amortization in the prior year due to a
    loss recognition adjustment resulting from low interest rates
    related to product guarantees coupled with high persistency
    rates on certain blocks of business, an increase in DAC
    amortization in the prior year associated with the
    implementation of a new valuation system, as well as one-time
    expenses in the prior year related to the termination of the
    agency force, and expense reductions recognized in the current
    year due to the elimination of the agency force.

Other expenses decreased in the home office primarily due to the
    elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously charged
    to the International segment, offset by higher spending on
    growth and infrastructure initiatives.

The Institutional segment contributed to the year over year
    increase primarily due to an increase in non-deferrable
    volume-related and corporate support expenses, higher DAC
    amortization associated with the ongoing implementation of

SOP 05-1

in the current year, a charge related to the reimbursement of
    dental claims in the current year, the establishment of a
    contingent legal liability in the current year and the impact of
    certain revisions in both years. These increases were partially
    offset by a benefit related to a reduction of an allowance for
    doubtful accounts in the current year, the impact of a charge of
    non-deferrable LTC commissions expense, a charge associated with
    costs related to the sale of certain small market record keeping
    businesses and a regulatory settlement, all in the prior year.

Corporate & Other contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to higher interest
    expense, higher interest on tax contingences and an increase in
    interest credited to bankholder deposits at MetLife Bank,
    National Association, a national bank (“MetLife Bank”
    or “MetLife Bank, N.A.”), partially offset by lower
    corporate support expenses, lower costs from reductions of
    MetLife Foundation contributions, integration costs incurred in
    the prior year and lower legal costs.

These increases in other expenses were partially offset by a
    decrease in the Auto & Home segment primarily related
    to lower information technology and advertising costs, partially
    offset by minor changes in a variety of expense categories.

These increases in other expenses were partially offset by a
    decrease in the Reinsurance segment primarily due to a decrease
    in expenses associated with DAC, partially offset by an increase
    in interest expense associated with note offerings in both
    years, an increase in minority interest expense, as well as an
    increase in compensation and overhead-related expenses
    associated with RGA’s international expansion and general
    growth in the operations.



Net
    Income

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
    $1,759 million, or 29% of income from continuing operations
    before provision for income tax, compared with
    $1,097 million, or 26% of such income, for the comparable
    2006 period. The 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates differ from
    the corporate tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of
    non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in
    low income housing. In addition, the increase in the effective
    rate for FIN 48 liability additions is entirely offset by
    an increase in non-taxable investment income. The 2007 period
    includes a benefit for decrease in international deferred tax
    valuation allowances and the 2006 period included a prior year
    benefit for international taxes. Lastly, the 2006 period
    included benefit for a “provision-to-filed return”
    adjustment regarding non-taxable investment income.

Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax,
    decreased by $3,185 million, or 99%, to $37 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $3,222 million for the comparable 2006 period. The decrease
    in income from discontinued operations was primarily due a gain
    of $3 billion, net of income tax, on the sale of the Peter
    Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties in Manhattan, New
    York, that was recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2006. In addition, there was lower net
    investment income and net investment gains (losses) of
    $144 million, net of income tax, from discontinued
    operations related to real estate properties sold or
    held-for-sale during the year ended December 31, 2007 as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Also
    contributing to the decrease was lower income from discontinued
    operations of $23 million, net of income tax, related to
    the sale of MetLife Australia’s annuities and pension
    businesses to a third party in the third quarter of 2007 and
    lower income from discontinued operations of $18 million,
    net of income tax, related to the sale of SSRM resulting from a
    reduction in additional proceeds from the sale received during
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year
    December 31, 2006.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations was $3,071 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31,
    2005. Excluding the acquisition of Travelers, which contributed
    $298 million during the first six months of 2006 to the
    year over year increase, income from continuing operations
    decreased by $298 million. Income from continuing
    operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
    included the impact of certain transactions or events, the
    timing, nature and amount of which are generally unpredictable.
    These transactions are described in each applicable
    segment’s discussion. These items contributed a charge of
    $23 million, net of income tax, to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. These items contributed a benefit of
    $48 million, net of income tax, to the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Excluding the impact of these items and
    the acquisition of Travelers, income from continuing operations
    decreased by $227 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the prior 2005 period.

The Institutional segment’s income from continuing
    operations decreased primarily due to an increase in net
    investment losses, a decline in interest margins, an increase in
    operating expenses, which included a charge



associated with costs related to the sale of certain small
    market recordkeeping businesses, a charge associated with
    non-deferrable LTC commissions expense and a charge associated
    with costs related to a previously announced regulatory
    settlement, partially offset by the impact of integration costs
    in the prior year and favorable underwriting results.

The Individual segment’s income from continuing operations
    decreased as a result of an increase in net investment losses, a
    decline in interest margins, higher expenses and annuity
    benefits, as well as increases in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances and policyholder dividends. These
    decreases were partially offset by increased fee income related
    to the growth in separate account products, favorable
    underwriting results in life products, lower DAC amortization
    and a decrease in the closed block-related policyholder dividend
    obligation.

Income from continuing operations in Corporate & Other
    decreased primarily due to higher investment losses, higher
    interest expense on debt, corporate support expenses, interest
    credited to bankholder deposits and legal-related costs,
    partially offset by an increase in tax benefits, an increase in
    net investment income, lower integration costs and an increase
    in other revenues.

The decrease in income from continuing operations in the
    International segment was primarily attributable to the
    following factors:

•

Taiwan had a decrease due to a loss recognition adjustment and a
    restructuring charge, partially offset by reserve refinements
    associated with the implementation of a new valuation system.

•

Income from continuing operations decreased in Canada primarily
    due to the realignment of economic capital in the prior year.

•

Income from continuing operations in Mexico decreased primarily
    due to an increase in amortization of DAC, higher operating
    expenses, the net impact of an adjustment to the liability for
    experience refunds on a block of business, a decrease in various
    one-time other revenue items in both periods, as well as an
    increase in income tax expense due to a tax benefit realized in
    the prior year. These decreases in Mexico were partially offset
    by a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities caused by a
    decrease in unrealized investment gains on invested assets
    supporting those liabilities relative to the prior year, a
    decrease in policyholder benefits associated with a large group
    policy that was not renewed by the policyholder, a benefit in
    the current year from the release of liabilities for pending
    claims that were determined to be invalid following a review,
    and the unfavorable impact in the prior year of contingent
    liabilities.

•

In addition, a decrease in Brazil was primarily due to an
    increase in policyholder benefits and claims related to an
    increase in future policyholder benefit liabilities on specific
    blocks of business and an increase in litigation liabilities, as
    well as adverse claim experience in the current year.

•

The home office recorded higher infrastructure expenditures in
    support of segment growth, as well as a contingent tax
    liability. This was offset by a reduction in the amount charged
    for economic capital.

•

Results of the Company’s investment in Japan decreased
    primarily due to variability in the hedging program.

•

In addition, expenses related to the Company’s

start-up

operations in Ireland reduced income from continuing operations.
    A valuation allowance was established against the deferred tax
    benefit resulting from the Ireland losses.

•

Partially offsetting these decreases in income from continuing
    operations were increases in Chile and the United Kingdom due to
    continued growth of the in-force business.

•

In addition, an increase occurred in Australia due to reserve
    strengthening on a block of business in the prior year.

•

South Korea’s income from continuing operations increased
    due to growth in the in-force business and the implementation of
    a more refined reserve valuation system.

•

Argentina’s income from continuing operations increased due
    to higher net investment income resulting from capital
    contributions, the release of liabilities for pending claims
    that were determined to be invalid following a review, the
    favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and
    inflation rates on certain



contingent liabilities, the utilization of net operating losses
    for which a valuation allowance had been previously established,
    and an increase in the prior year period of a deferred income
    tax valuation allowance, as well as business growth. Changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the increase.

Partially offsetting the decreases in income from continuing
    operations was an increase in the Auto & Home segment
    primarily due to a loss in the third quarter of 2005 related to
    Hurricane Katrina, favorable development of prior year loss
    reserves, improvement in non-catastrophe loss experience and a
    reduction in loss adjustment expenses. These increases were
    partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, excluding
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, in the current year period, and
    decreases in net earned premiums, other revenues, and net
    investment income, as well as an increase in other expenses.

Income from continuing operations in the Reinsurance segment
    increased primarily due to added business in-force from
    facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on
    existing blocks of business in the U.S. and international
    operations, an increase in net investment income due to growth
    in the invested asset base and an increase in other revenues.
    These items were partially offset by unfavorable mortality
    experience, an increase in liabilities associated with
    Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated’s
    (“RGA”) Argentine pension business in the prior period
    and an increase in other expenses, primarily related to expenses
    associated with DAC, interest expense, minority interest expense
    and equity compensation costs.

Revenues
    and Expenses

Premiums,
    Fees and Other Revenues

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $2,595 million, or 9%, to $32,554 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $29,959 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. Excluding the impact of the acquisition
    of Travelers, which contributed $945 million during the
    first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase,
    premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $1,650 million.

The growth in the Reinsurance segment was primarily attributable
    to premiums from new facultative and automatic treaties and
    renewal premiums on existing blocks of business in the
    U.S. and international operations.

The growth in the International segment was primarily due to the
    following factors:

•

An increase in Mexico’s premiums, fees and other revenues
    due to growth in the business and higher fees, partially offset
    by an adjustment for experience refunds on a block of business
    and various one- time other revenue items in both years.

•

South Korea’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    due to business growth, as well as the favorable impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Brazil’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased due to
    business growth and higher bancassurance business, as well as an
    increase in amounts retained under reinsurance arrangements.



•

Chile’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to higher institutional premiums through its bank
    distribution channel, partially offset by lower annuity sales.

•

Business growth in the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia and
    Taiwan, as well as the favorable impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, also contributed to the increase in the
    International segment.

The growth in the Institutional segment was primarily due to
    growth in the dental, disability, AD&D products, as well as
    growth in the LTC and IDI businesses, all within the non-medical
    health & other business. Additionally, growth in the
    group life business was attributable to the impact of sales and
    favorable persistency largely in the term life business. These
    increases in the non-medical health & other and group
    life businesses were partially offset by a decrease in the
    retirement & savings business. The decline in
    retirement & savings was primarily due to a decline in
    premiums from structured settlements predominantly due to lower
    sales, partially offset by an increase in master terminal
    funding premiums (“MTF”).

The growth in the Individual segment was primarily due to higher
    fee income from universal life and investment-type products and
    an increase in premiums from other life products, partially
    offset by a decrease in immediate annuity premiums and a decline
    in premiums associated with the Company’s closed block
    business as this business continues to run-off.

Net
    Investment Income

Net investment income increased by $2,326 million, or 16%,
    to $17,082 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006 from $14,756 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers, which
    contributed $1,425 million during the first six months of
    2006 to the year over year increase, net investment income
    increased by $901 million of which management attributes
    $648 million to growth in the average asset base and
    $253 million to an increase in yields. This increase was
    primarily due to an overall increase in the asset base, an
    increase in fixed maturity security yields, improved results on
    real estate and real estate joint ventures, mortgage loans, and
    other limited partnership interests, as well as higher
    short-term interest rates on cash equivalents and short-term
    investments. These increases were partially offset by a decline
    in investment income from securities lending results, and bond
    and commercial mortgage prepayment fees.

Interest
    Margin

Interest margin, which represents the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to policyholder account
    balances, decreased in the Institutional and Individual segments
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the
    prior year. Interest earned approximates net investment income
    on investable assets attributed to the segment with minor
    adjustments related to the consolidation of certain separate
    accounts and other minor non-policyholder elements. Interest
    credited is the amount attributed to insurance products,
    recorded in policyholder benefits and claims, and the amount
    credited to policyholder account balances for investment-type
    products, recorded in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances. Interest credited on insurance products reflects the
    current period impact of the interest rate assumptions
    established at issuance or acquisition. Interest credited to
    policyholder account balances is subject to contractual terms,
    including some minimum guarantees. This tends to move gradually
    over time to reflect market interest rate movements and may
    reflect actions by management to respond to competitive
    pressures and, therefore, generally does not introduce
    volatility in expense.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses)

Net investment losses increased by $1,296 million to a loss
    of $1,382 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from a loss of $86 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers, which
    contributed a loss of $294 million during the first six
    months of 2006 to the year over year increase, net investment
    losses increased by $1,002 million. The increase in net
    investment losses was due to a combination of losses from the
    mark-to-market on derivatives and foreign currency transaction
    losses during 2006, largely driven by increases in
    U.S. interest rates and the weakening of the dollar against
    the major currencies the Company hedges, notably the euro and
    pound sterling.



Underwriting

Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity or other insurance costs, less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity or
    other insurance-related experience trends and the reinsurance
    activity related to certain blocks of business and, as a result,
    can fluctuate from period to period. Underwriting results were
    favorable within the life products in the Individual segment, as
    well as in the Reinsurance segment, and in the group life and
    non-medical health & other products in the
    Institutional segment. Retirement & saving’s
    underwriting results were mixed across several products in the
    Institutional segment. Underwriting results, excluding
    catastrophes, in the Auto & Home segment were
    favorable for the year ended December 31, 2006, as the
    combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, decreased to 82.8% from
    86.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Underwriting
    results in the International segment increased commensurate with
    the growth in the business for most countries with the exception
    of Brazil, which experienced unfavorable claim experience, and
    Argentina, which experienced improved claim experience.

Other
    Expenses

Other expenses increased by $1,519 million, or 16%, to
    $10,783 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $9,264 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers, which
    contributed $605 million during the first six months of
    2006 to the year over year increase, other expenses increased by
    $914 million. The year ended December 31, 2006
    includes a $35 million contribution to the MetLife
    Foundation. The year ended December 31, 2005 included a
    $28 million benefit associated with the reduction of a
    previously established real estate transfer tax liability
    related to MLIC’s demutualization in 2000. Excluding these
    items and the acquisition of Travelers, other expenses increased
    by $851 million from the comparable 2005 period.

The International segment contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to business growth
    commensurate with the increase in revenues discussed above and
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This was driven by
    the following factors:

•

Taiwan’s other expenses increased due to an increase in
    amortization of DAC, due to a loss recognition adjustment,
    refinements associated with the implementation of a new
    valuation system and a restructuring charge.

•

Mexico’s other expenses increased due to an increase in
    commissions commensurate with the revenue growth, higher DAC
    amortization, higher expenses related to growth initiatives and
    additional expenses associated with the Mexican pension
    business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
    contingent liabilities that were established in the prior year
    related to potential employment matters and which were
    eliminated in the current year.

•

South Korea’s other expenses increased due to an increase
    in DAC amortization and general expenses, partially offset by a
    decrease in DAC amortization associated with the implementation
    of a more refined reserve valuation system.



•

Brazil’s other expenses increased due to an increase in
    litigation liabilities.

•

Other expenses associated with the home office increased due to
    an increase in expenditures for information technology projects,
    growth initiative projects and integration costs, as well as an
    increase in compensation expense.

•

In addition, expenses were incurred related to the

start-up

of
    operations in Ireland.

Corporate & Other contributed to the year over year
    variance in other expenses primarily due to higher interest
    expense, corporate support expenses, interest credited to
    bankholder deposits at MetLife Bank and legal-related costs,
    partially offset by lower integration costs.

The Reinsurance segment also contributed to the increase in
    other expenses primarily due to an increase in expenses
    associated with DAC, interest expense and minority interest, as
    well as an increase in compensation, including equity
    compensation expense and overhead-related expenses.

The Institutional segment contributed to the year over year
    increase primarily due to an increase in non-deferrable
    volume-related expenses, a charge associated with costs related
    to the sale of certain small market recordkeeping businesses, a
    charge associated with non-deferrable LTC commissions expense
    and a charge associated with costs related to a previously
    announced regulatory settlement, all within the current year,
    partially offset by the reduction in Travelers-related
    integration costs, principally incentive accruals and an
    adjustment of DAC for certain LTC products.

The Auto & Home segment contributed to the year over
    year increase primarily due to expenditures related to
    information technology, advertising and compensation costs.

Partially offsetting the increases in other expenses was a
    decrease in the Individual segment. This decrease was primarily
    due to lower DAC amortization, partially offset by higher
    general spending in the current year, despite higher corporate
    incentives. In addition, the impact of revisions to certain
    expenses, premium tax, policyholder liabilities and pension and
    postretirement liabilities, in both periods, increased other
    expenses in the current year period.

Net
    Income

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    $1,097 million, or 26% of income from continuing operations
    before provision for income tax, compared with
    $1,222 million, or 28%, of such income, for the comparable
    2005 period. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of
    Travelers, which contributed $118 million during the first
    six months of 2006, income tax expense was $979 million, or
    26%, of income from continuing operations before provision for
    income tax, compared with $1,222 million, or 28%, of such
    income, for the comparable 2005 period. The 2006 and 2005
    effective tax rates differ from the corporate tax rate of 35%
    primarily due to the impact of non-taxable investment income and
    tax credits for investments in low income housing. The 2006
    effective tax rate also includes an adjustment of a benefit of
    $33 million consisting primarily of a revision in the
    estimate of income tax for 2005, and the 2005 effective tax rate
    also includes a tax benefit of $27 million related to the
    repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to Internal Revenue
    Code Section 965 for which a U.S. deferred tax
    provision had previously been recorded and an adjustment of a
    benefit of $31 million consisting primarily of a revision
    in the estimate of income tax for 2004.

Income from discontinued operations consisted of net investment
    income and net investment gains related to real estate
    properties that the Company had classified as available-for-sale
    or had sold and, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the operations and gain upon disposal from the sale of
    SSRM on January 31, 2005 and for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the operations of MetLife Indonesia
    which was sold on September 29, 2005. Income from
    discontinued operations, net of income tax, increased by
    $1,579 million, or 96%, to $3,222 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $1,643 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. This increase is primarily due to a gain
    of $3 billion, net of income tax, on the sale of the Peter
    Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties in Manhattan, New
    York, as well as a gain of $32 million, net of income tax,
    related to the sale of SSRM during the year ended
    December 31, 2006. This increase was partially offset by
    gains during the year ended December 31, 2005 including
    $1,193 million, net of income tax, on the sales of the One
    Madison Avenue and 200 Park Avenue



properties in Manhattan, New York, as well as gains on the sales
    of SSRM and MetLife Indonesia of $177 million and
    $10 million, respectively, both net of income tax. In
    addition, there was lower net investment income and net
    investment gains from discontinued operations related to real
    estate properties sold or held-for-sale during the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Dividends on the Holding Company’s Preferred Shares issued
    in connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers
    increased by $71 million, to $134 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, from $63 million for the
    comparable 2005 period, as the preferred stock was issued in
    June 2005.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased $314 million,
    or 28%, to $1,439 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 from $1,125 million for the
    comparable 2006 period.

Included in this increase are higher earnings of
    $33 million, net of income tax, from lower net investment
    losses. In addition, higher earnings of $11 million, net of
    income tax, resulted from an increase in policyholder benefits
    and claims related to net investment gains (losses). Excluding
    the impact of net investment gains (losses), income from
    continuing operations increased by $270 million, net of
    income tax, compared to the prior year.

Interest margins increased $229 million, net of income tax,
    compared to the prior year. Management attributes this increase
    to a $146 million increase in retirement &
    savings, a $46 million increase in group life and a
    $37 million increase in non-medical health and other,
    respectively, all net of income tax. Interest margin is the



difference between interest earned and interest credited to
    policyholder account balances. Interest earned approximates net
    investment income on investable assets attributed to the segment
    with minor adjustments related to the consolidation of certain
    separate accounts and other minor non-policyholder elements.
    Interest credited is the amount attributed to insurance
    products, recorded in policyholder benefits and claims, and the
    amount credited to policyholder account balances for
    investment-type products, recorded in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances. Interest credited on insurance
    products reflects the current year impact of the interest rate
    assumptions established at issuance or acquisition. Interest
    credited to policyholder account balances is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees. This tends
    to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate
    movements, and may reflect actions by management to respond to
    competitive pressures and, therefore, generally does not
    introduce volatility in expense.

An increase in underwriting results of $89 million, net of
    income tax, compared to the prior year, contributed to the
    increase in income from continuing operations. Management
    attributes this increase primarily to the non-medical
    health & other, group life and retirement &
    savings businesses with increases of $65 million,
    $16 million and $8 million, all net of income tax,
    respectively.

Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity, or other insurance costs less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity, or
    other insurance-related experience trends, as well as the
    reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business.
    Consequently, results can fluctuate from period to period.

Partially offsetting this increase in income from continuing
    operations were higher expenses related to an increase in
    non-deferrable volume-related expenses and corporate support
    expenses of $72 million, net of income tax, as well as an
    increase in DAC amortization of $44 million, net of income
    tax, primarily due to a $40 million, net of income tax,
    charge due to the ongoing impact on DAC and VOBA amortization
    resulting from the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in the current year. This increase in expense was partially
    offset by the impact of certain revisions in both years for a
    net decrease of $34 million, net of income tax. The
    remaining increase in operating expenses was more than offset by
    the remaining increase in premiums, fees, and other revenues.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,508 million, or 7%, to $22,100 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $20,592 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Net investment income increased by $914 million. Management
    attributes $742 million of this increase to growth in the
    average asset base primarily within mortgage loans on real
    estate, fixed maturity securities, real estate joint ventures,
    other limited partnership interests, and equity securities,
    driven by continued business growth, particularly growth in the
    funding agreements and global GIC businesses. Additionally,
    management attributes $172 million of this increase in net
    investment income to an increase in yields, primarily due to
    higher returns on fixed maturity securities, improved securities
    lending results, other limited partnership interests, and equity
    securities, partially offset by a decline in yields on real
    estate and real estate joint ventures and mortgage loans.

The increase of $594 million in premiums, fees and other
    revenues was largely due to increases in the non-medical
    health & other business of $483 million,
    primarily due to growth in the dental, disability, AD&D and
    IDI businesses of $478 million. Partially offsetting these
    increases in the non-medical health & other business
    is a decline in the LTC business of $7 million, which
    includes a $66 million decrease resulting from a shift to
    deposit liability-type contracts in the current year. Excluding
    this shift, LTC premiums would have increased due to growth in
    the business. Group life increased $345 million, which
    management primarily attributes to a $262 million increase
    in term life, primarily due to growth in the business from new
    sales and an increase in reinsurance assumed, partially offset
    by the impact of an increase in experience rated refunds. In
    addition, corporate-owned life insurance and life insurance sold
    to postretirement benefit plans increased by $65 million
    and $30 million, respectively. The increase in
    corporate-owned life insurance is largely attributable to fees
    earned on a large sale in the current year. These increases in
    group life’s premiums, fees and other revenues were
    partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in the
    universal life insurance products. Partially offsetting the
    increase in premiums, fees and other revenues was a decline in
    retirement & savings’ premiums, fees and other
    revenues of $234 million, primarily from declines of



$158 million and $79 million in structured settlement
    and pension closeout premiums, respectively, partially offset by
    an increase of $3 million across several products. The
    declines in the structured settlement and pension closeout
    businesses are predominantly due to the impact of lower sales in
    the current year. Premiums, fees and other revenues from
    retirement & savings products are significantly
    influenced by large transactions and, as a result, can fluctuate
    from period to period.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $1,064 million, or 6%, to
    $19,338 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $18,274 million for the comparable 2006 period.

The increase in expenses was attributable to higher interest
    credited to policyholder account balances of $501 million,
    higher policyholder benefits and claims of $439 million and
    an increase in operating expenses of $124 million.

Management attributes the increase of $501 million in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances to a
    $352 million increase solely from growth in the average
    policyholder account balances, primarily resulting from growth
    in global GICs and funding agreements within the
    retirement & savings business and a $149 million
    increase from a rise in average crediting rates, largely due to
    the global GIC program, coupled with a rise in short-term
    interest rates in the current year.

The increase in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $439 million included a $16 million decrease related
    to net investment gains (losses). Excluding the decrease related
    to net investment gains (losses), policyholder benefits and
    claims increased by $455 million. Non-medical
    health & other’s policyholder benefits and claims
    increased by $385 million. This increase was largely due to
    a $371 million increase in the dental, disability, IDI and
    AD&D businesses, resulting from the aforementioned growth
    in business. This increase was partially offset by favorable
    claim experience in the dental business and favorable morbidity
    experience in the disability, IDI and AD&D businesses. This
    increase included charges related to certain refinements of
    $14 million in the current year in LTD and the impact of a
    $22 million disability liability reduction in the prior
    year, which contributed to the increase. An increase in LTC of
    $14 million is largely attributable to business growth and
    an increase in interest credited, partially offset by the
    aforementioned $66 million shift to deposit liability-type
    contracts and the impact of more favorable claim experience in
    the current year. Group life’s policyholder benefits and
    claims increased by $264 million due mostly to an increase
    in the term life business of $245 million, which included
    the impact of less favorable mortality in the term life product,
    partially offset by the net impact of favorable liability
    refinements of $12 million in the current year. An increase
    of $29 million in life insurance sold to postretirement
    plans and $25 million for other group life products,
    including corporate-owned life insurance, also contributed to
    the increase in policyholder benefits and claims for group life.
    The increases in term life and life insurance sold to
    postretirement benefit plans are commensurate with the
    aforementioned premiums increases. These increases were
    partially offset by a decline in universal group life products
    of $36 million, primarily due to favorable claim
    experience. Retirement & savings’ policyholder
    benefits decreased by $194 million, which was largely due
    to decreases in the pension closeout and structured settlement
    businesses of $98 million and $97 million,
    respectively. The decrease in pension closeouts was primarily
    due to the aforementioned decrease in premiums and a decrease in
    interest credited. The decline in structured settlements was
    primarily a result of the aforementioned decline in premiums,
    partially offset by an increase in interest credited and less
    favorable mortality experience in the current year. In addition,
    this decrease included the net impact of favorable liability
    refinements in the current year, which contributed a decrease of
    $20 million, and the net impact of favorable liability
    refinements in the prior year of $57 million, largely
    related to business associated with the acquisition of
    Travelers, principally in the structured settlement, pension
    closeout and general account businesses.

Higher other expenses of $124 million included an increase
    in non-deferrable volume-related expenses and corporate support
    expenses of $108 million. Non-deferrable volume-related
    expenses included those expenses associated with direct
    departmental spending, information technology, commissions and
    premium taxes. Corporate support expenses included advertising,
    corporate overhead and consulting fees. The increase in other
    expenses was also attributable to higher DAC amortization of
    $68 million, primarily due to a $61 million charge as
    a result of the ongoing impact of DAC and VOBA amortization
    resulting from the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in the current year.



In addition, a charge of $14 million related to the
    reimbursement of certain dental claims and a $15 million
    charge related to the establishment of a contingent legal
    liability in the current year contributed to the increase in
    other expenses. The impact of certain revisions in both years
    also contributed to a net increase in other expenses of
    $2 million. These increases were partially offset by a
    $13 million benefit related to a reduction of an allowance
    for doubtful accounts in the current year. Additionally, the
    prior year included the impact of a $22 million charge for
    non-deferrable LTC commissions expense, a charge of
    $24 million associated with costs related to the sale of
    certain small market recordkeeping businesses and
    $24 million related to a regulatory settlement, which
    reduced other expenses in the current year.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005 — Institutional

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased $263 million,
    or 19%, to $1,125 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $1,388 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers contributed
    $56 million during the first six months of 2006 to income
    from continuing operations, which included a decline of
    $104 million, net of income tax, of net investment gains
    (losses). Excluding the impact of Travelers, income from
    continuing operations decreased $319 million, or 23%, from
    the comparable 2005 period.

Included in this decrease was a decline of $300 million,
    net of income tax, in net investment gains (losses), as well as
    a decline of $18 million, net of income tax, resulting from
    an increase in policyholder benefits and claims related to net
    investment gains (losses). Excluding the impact of Travelers and
    the decline in net investment gains (losses), income from
    continuing operations was flat when compared to the prior year
    period.

A decrease in interest margins of $84 million, net of
    income tax, compared to the prior year period contributed to the
    decrease in income from continuing operations. Management
    attributes this decrease primarily to the group life and
    retirement & savings businesses of $60 million
    and $51 million, both net of income tax, respectively.
    Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of
    $27 million, net of income tax, in the non-medical
    health & other business. Interest margin is the
    difference between interest earned and interest credited to
    policyholder account balances. Interest earned approximates net
    investment income on investable assets attributed to the segment
    with minor adjustments related to the consolidation of certain
    separate accounts and other minor non-policyholder elements.
    Interest credited is the amount attributed to insurance
    products, recorded in policyholder benefits and claims, and the
    amount credited to policyholder account balances for
    investment-type products, recorded in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances. Interest credited on insurance
    products reflects the current period impact of the interest rate
    assumptions established at issuance or acquisition. Interest
    credited to policyholder account balances is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees. This tends
    to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate
    movements, may reflect actions by management to respond to
    competitive pressures and therefore, generally does not
    introduce volatility in expense.

The year over year variance in income from continuing operations
    included charges recorded in other expenses of $17 million,
    net of income tax, associated with costs related to the sale of
    certain small market recordkeeping businesses, $16 million,
    net of income tax, due to costs associated with a previously
    announced regulatory settlement and $15 million, net of
    income tax, associated with non-deferrable LTC commission
    expense. Partially offsetting these increases in operating
    expenses were benefits due to prior year charges of
    $28 million, net of income tax, as a result of the impact
    of Travelers’ integration costs and $14 million, net
    of income tax, related to an adjustment of DAC for certain LTC
    products.

Partially offsetting these decreases in income from continuing
    operations was an increase in underwriting results of
    $97 million, net of income tax, compared to the prior year
    period. This increase was primarily due to favorable results of
    $48 million, $38 million and $11 million, all net
    of income tax, in the group life, the non-medical
    health & other businesses and the
    retirement & savings businesses, respectively.

The results in group life were primarily due to favorable
    mortality results, predominantly in the term life business,
    which included a benefit from reserve refinements in the current
    year.

Non-medical health & other’s favorable
    underwriting results were primarily due to improvements in the
    IDI and dental businesses. The IDI results included certain
    reserve refinements in the prior year. Partially offsetting



these increases was a decrease in the AD&D and disability
    businesses. Disability’s results include the benefit of
    prior and current year reserve refinements.

Retirement & savings’ underwriting results were
    favorable with mixed underwriting across several products.
    Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity, or other insurance costs less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity, or
    other insurance-related experience trends and the reinsurance
    activity related to certain blocks of business.

The remaining increase in operating expenses more than offset
    the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,838 million, or 10%, to
    $20,592 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $18,754 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $797 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase.
    Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition, such revenues
    increased by $1,041 million, or 6%, from the comparable
    2005 period. This increase was comprised of higher net
    investment income of $583 million and growth in premiums,
    fees and other revenues of $458 million.

Net investment income increased by $583 million of which
    management attributes $463 million to growth in the average
    asset base driven by business growth throughout 2005 and 2006,
    particularly in the GIC and structured settlement businesses and
    $120 million to an increase in yields. The increase in
    yields was primarily attributable to higher yields on fixed
    maturity securities, an increase in short-term rates and higher
    returns on joint ventures. These increases were partially offset
    by a decline in securities lending results and commercial
    mortgage prepayment fees.

The increase of $458 million in premiums, fees and other
    revenues was largely due to increases in the non-medical
    health & other business of $408 million,
    primarily due to growth in the dental, disability and AD&D
    products of $255 million. In addition, continued growth in
    the LTC and IDI businesses contributed $117 million and
    $25 million, respectively. Group life increased by
    $296 million, which management primarily attributes to the
    impact of sales and favorable persistency largely in term life
    business, which includes a significant increase in premiums from
    two large customers. Partially offsetting these increases was a
    decline in retirement & savings’ premiums, fees
    and other revenues of $246 million, resulting primarily
    from a decline of $320 million in structured settlements,
    predominantly due to the impact of lower sales. This decline was
    partially offset by a $83 million increase in MTF premiums.
    Premiums, fees and other revenues from retirement &
    savings products are significantly influenced by large
    transactions and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to
    period.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $1,616 million, or 10%, to
    $18,274 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $16,658 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $551 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase.
    Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition, total
    expenses increased $1,065 million, or 6%, from the
    comparable 2005 period.

The increase in expenses was attributable to higher interest
    credited to policyholder account balances of $621 million,
    policyholder benefits and claims of $366 million and
    operating expenses of $79 million.

Management attributes the increase of $621 million in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances to
    $433 million from an increase in average crediting rates,
    which was largely due to the impact of higher short-term rates
    in the current year period and $188 million solely from
    growth in the average policyholder account balances, primarily
    resulting from GICs within the retirement & savings
    business.

The increases in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $366 million included a $27 million increase related
    to net investment gains (losses). Excluding the increase related
    to net investment gains (losses), policyholder benefits and
    claims increased by $339 million. Non-medical
    health & other’s policyholder benefits and claims
    increased by $306 million, predominantly due to the
    aforementioned growth in business, as well as unfavorable
    morbidity in



disability and unfavorable claim experience in AD&D.
    Partially offsetting these increases was favorable claim and
    morbidity experience in IDI, as well as the impact of an
    establishment of a $25 million liability for future losses
    in the prior year. In addition, favorable claim experience in
    the current year reduced dental policyholder benefits and
    claims. Additionally, disability business included a
    $22 million benefit which resulted from reserve refinements
    in the current year. The year over year variance in disability
    also includes the impact of an $18 million loss related to
    Hurricane Katrina in the prior year. Group life’s
    policyholder benefits and claims increased by $238 million,
    largely due to the aforementioned growth in the business,
    partially offset by favorable underwriting results, particularly
    in the term life business. Term life included a benefit of
    $16 million due to reserve refinements in the current year.
    Partially offsetting the increase was a retirement &
    savings’ policyholder benefits and claims decrease of
    $205 million, predominantly due to the aforementioned
    decrease in revenues, partially offset by higher FAS 60
    interest credits recorded in policyholder benefits and claims
    due to growth in structured settlements and MTF.

The increase in other expenses of $79 million was primarily
    due to an increase in the current year of $60 million in
    non-deferrable volume related expenses and corporate support
    expenses. Non-deferrable volume related expenses include those
    expenses associated with information technology, direct
    departmental spending and commission expenses. Corporate support
    expenses include advertising, corporate overhead and consulting
    fees. Also contributing to the increase was $26 million
    associated with costs related to the sale of certain small
    market recordkeeping businesses, $23 million of
    non-deferrable LTC commission expense, $24 million related
    to costs associated with a previously announced regulatory
    settlement and $11 million related to stock-based
    compensation. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits
    due to prior year charges of $43 million in
    Travelers-related integration costs, principally incentive
    accruals and $22 million related to an adjustment of DAC
    for certain LTC products.

Year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2006 — Individual

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $110 million, or 9%, to $1,356 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $1,246 million for the
    comparable 2006 period. Included in this increase was a decrease
    in net investment losses of $324 million, net of income
    tax. Excluding the impact of net investment gains (losses),
    income from continuing operations decreased by $214 million
    from the comparable 2006 period.

The decrease in income from continuing operations for the year
    was driven by the following items:

•

Higher DAC amortization of $204 million, net of income tax,
    primarily resulting from business growth, lower net investment
    losses in the current year and revisions to management’s
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    margins.

•

Unfavorable underwriting results in life products of
    $134 million, net of income tax. Underwriting results are
    generally the difference between the portion of premium and fee
    income intended to cover mortality, morbidity or other insurance
    costs less claims incurred and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or other insurance-related experience
    trends, as well as the reinsurance activity related to certain
    blocks of business. Consequently, results can fluctuate from
    period to period.

•

Higher expenses of $129 million, net of income tax. Higher
    general expenses, the impact of revisions to certain liabilities
    in both periods, and the write-off of a receivable from one of
    the Company’s joint venture partners contributed to the
    increase in other expenses.

•

An increase in the closed block-related policyholder dividend
    obligation of $75 million, net of income tax, which was
    driven by net investment gains.

•

Higher annuity benefits of $24 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to higher amortization of deferred costs,
    partially offset by lower costs of guaranteed annuity benefit
    riders and related hedging.

•

An increase in policyholder dividends of $14 million, net
    of income tax, due to growth in the business.

•

An increase in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances of $13 million, net of income tax, due primarily
    to lower amortization of the excess interest reserves on
    acquired annuity and universal life blocks of business.

These aforementioned decreases in income from continuing
    operations were partially offset by the following items:

•

Higher fee income from separate account products of
    $271 million, net of income tax, primarily related to fees
    being earned on a higher average account balance resulting from
    a combination of growth in the business and overall market
    performance.

•

Higher net investment income on blocks of business not driven by
    interest margins of $85 million, net of income tax, due to
    an increase in yields and growth in the average asset base.

•

An increase in interest margins of $18 million, net of
    income tax. Interest margins relate primarily to the general
    account portion of investment-type products. Management
    attributed a $1 million decrease to the deferred annuity
    business offset by a $19 million increase to other
    investment-type products, both net of income tax. Interest
    margin is the difference between interest earned and interest
    credited to policyholder account balances related to the general
    account on these businesses. Interest earned approximates net
    investment income on invested assets attributed to these
    businesses with net adjustments for other non-policyholder
    elements. Interest credited approximates the amount recorded in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances. Interest
    credited to policyholder account balances is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees, and may
    reflect actions by management to respond to competitive
    pressures. Interest credited to policyholder account balances
    tends to move gradually over time to reflect market interest
    rate movements, subject to any minimum guarantees and,
    therefore, generally does not introduce volatility in expense.



The change in effective tax rates between periods accounts for
    the remainder of the decrease in income from continuing
    operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $504 million, or 3%, to $15,660 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $15,156 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Premiums decreased by $20 million due to a decrease in
    immediate annuity premiums of $27 million, and an
    $89 million decline in premiums associated with the
    Company’s closed block of business, in line with
    expectations. These decreases were partially offset by growth in
    premiums from other life products of $96 million, primarily
    driven by increased sales of term life business.

Universal life and investment-type product policy fees combined
    with other revenues increased by $384 million due to a
    combination of growth in the business and improved overall
    market performance, as well as revisions to management’s
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    margins. Policy fees from variable life and annuity and
    investment-type products are typically calculated as a
    percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts. The
    value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity
    performance.

Net investment income increased by $140 million. Net
    investment income from the general account portion of
    investment-type products and other businesses increased by
    $45 million and $95 million, respectively. Management
    attributes $5 million of this increase to an increase in
    yields, primarily due to higher returns on other limited
    partnership interests. Additionally, management attributes
    $135 million to growth in the average asset base across
    various investment types.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $840 million, or 7%, to
    $13,500 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $12,660 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $312 million
    primarily due to an increase in the closed

block-related

policyholder dividend obligation of $115 million which was
    primarily driven by net investment gains. Unfavorable mortality
    in the life products, as well as revisions to policyholder
    benefits in both periods, contributed $180 million to this
    increase. Included in this increase was $72 million of
    unfavorable mortality in the closed block and a prior year net
    increase of $15 million in the excess mortality liability
    on specific blocks of life insurance policies. Higher
    amortization of sales inducements resulting from business growth
    and revisions to management’s assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits and margins, partially offset by lower
    costs of guaranteed annuity benefit riders and related hedging
    increased annuity benefits by $37 million. Partially
    offsetting these increases, policyholder benefits and claims
    decreased by $20 million commensurate with the decrease in
    premiums discussed above.

Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased by
    $5 million. Interest credited on the general account
    portion of investment-type products and other businesses
    decreased by $15 million and $10 million,
    respectively. Of the $15 million decrease on the general
    account portion of investment-type products, management
    attributed $67 million to higher crediting rates, more than
    offset by $82 million due to lower average policyholder
    account balances. Partially offsetting these decreases was lower
    amortization of the excess interest reserves on acquired annuity
    and universal life blocks of business of $20 million
    primarily driven by lower lapses in the current year.

Policyholder dividends increased by $21 million due to
    growth in the business.

Higher other expenses of $512 million include higher DAC
    amortization of $314 million resulting from business
    growth, lower net investment losses and revisions to
    management’s assumptions used to determine estimated gross
    profits and margins. The remaining increase in other expenses of
    $198 million was comprised of $167 million associated
    with business growth, information technology and other general
    expenses, $7 million due to the impact of revisions to
    certain liabilities including pension and postretirement
    liabilities and policyholder



liabilities in the prior year, and $24 million associated
    with the write-off of a receivable from one of the
    Company’s joint venture partners in the current year.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005 — Individual

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by $44 million,
    or 4%, to $1,246 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $1,202 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers contributed
    $112 million during the first six months of 2006 to income
    from continuing operations, which included $88 million, net
    of income tax, of net investment losses. Included in the
    Travelers results was a $21 million increase to the excess
    mortality liability on specific blocks of life insurance
    policies. Excluding the impact of Travelers, income from
    continuing operations decreased by $68 million, or 6%, to
    $1,134 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $1,202 million for the comparable 2005 period.

Included in this decrease were net investment losses of
    $270 million, net of income tax. Excluding the impact of
    net investment gains (losses) and the acquisition of Travelers
    for the first six months of 2006, income from continuing
    operations increased by $202 million from the comparable
    2005 period.

The increase in income from continuing operations for the year
    was driven by the following items:

•

Higher fee income from separate account products of
    $151 million, net of income tax, primarily related to fees
    being earned on a higher average account balance resulting from
    a combination of growth in the business and overall market
    performance.

•

Lower DAC amortization of $113 million, net of income tax,
    resulting from investment losses and revisions to
    management’s assumptions used to determine estimated gross
    profits and margins.

•

A decrease in the closed block-related policyholder dividend
    obligation of $68 million, net of income tax.

•

Favorable underwriting results in life products of
    $61 million, net of income tax. Underwriting results are
    generally the difference between the portion of premium and fee
    income intended to cover mortality, morbidity or other insurance
    costs less claims incurred and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or other insurance-related experience
    trends, as well as the reinsurance activity related to certain
    blocks of business. Consequently, results can fluctuate from
    period to period.

•

Higher net investment income on blocks of business that were not
    driven by interest margins of $16 million, net of income
    tax.

These aforementioned increases in income from continuing
    operations were partially offset by the following items:

•

A decline in interest margins of $58 million, net of income
    tax. Interest margins relate primarily to the general account
    portion of investment-type products. Management attributed
    $40 million of this decrease to the deferred annuity
    business and the remaining $18 million to other
    investment-type products. Interest margin is the difference
    between interest earned and interest credited to policyholder
    account balances related to the general account on these
    businesses. Interest earned approximates net investment income
    on invested assets attributed to these businesses with net
    adjustments for other non-policyholder elements. Interest
    credited approximates the amount recorded in interest credited
    to policyholder account balances. Interest credited to
    policyholder account balances is subject to contractual terms,
    including some minimum guarantees, and may reflect actions by
    management to respond to competitive pressures. Interest
    credited to policyholder account balances tends to move
    gradually over time to reflect market interest rate movements,
    subject to any minimum guarantees, and therefore, generally does
    not introduce volatility in expense.

•

Higher expenses of $52 million, net of income tax. Higher
    general spending in the current period was partially offset by
    higher corporate incentives in the prior year.

•

Higher annuity benefits of $30 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to higher costs of the guaranteed annuity benefit
    riders and the related hedging, and revisions to future
    policyholder benefits.



•

An increase in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances of $26 million, net of income tax, due primarily
    to lower amortization of the excess interest reserves on
    acquired annuity and universal life blocks of business.

•

An increase in policyholder dividends of $18 million, net
    of income tax, due to growth in the business.

The change in effective tax rates between periods accounts for
    the remainder of the increase in income from continuing
    operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,184 million, or 8%, to $15,156 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $13,972 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $1,009 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the period over period increase.
    Excluding the impact of Travelers, such revenues increased by
    $175 million, or 1%, from the comparable 2005 period.

Premiums decreased by $38 million due to a decrease in
    immediate annuity premiums of $22 million, and a
    $103 million expected decline in premiums associated with
    the Company’s closed block of business, partially offset by
    growth in premiums from other life products of $87 million.

Higher universal life and investment-type product policy fees
    combined with other revenues of $267 million resulted from
    a combination of growth in the business and improved overall
    market performance. Policy fees from variable life and annuity
    and investment-type products are typically calculated as a
    percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts. The
    value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity
    performance.

Net investment income decreased by $54 million. Net
    investment income from the general account portion of
    investment-type products decreased by $56 million which was
    partially offset by an increase of $2 million in other
    businesses. Management attributed a decrease of
    $146 million partially to lower yields in the current year
    primarily resulting from lower income from securities lending
    activities, mortgage and bond prepayment fee income, partially
    offset by higher corporate joint venture income. In addition,
    management attributed an increase of $92 million from
    growth in the average asset base primarily from equity
    securities and mortgage loans.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $534 million, or 4%, to
    $12,660 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $12,126 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $706 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the period over period increase.
    Included in the Travelers results was a $33 million
    increase to the excess mortality liability on specific blocks of
    life insurance policies. Excluding the impact of Travelers,
    total expenses decreased by $172 million, or 1%, from the
    comparable 2005 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $156 million
    primarily due to a reduction in the closed block-related
    policyholder dividend obligation of $105 million driven by
    higher net investment losses. A reduction of $49 million
    related to the excess mortality liability on a specific block of
    life insurance policies that lapsed or otherwise changed also
    contributed to the decrease. In addition, policyholder benefits
    and claims decreased by $38 million commensurate with the
    decrease in premiums discussed above. Unfavorable mortality in
    the closed block of $99 million was more than offset by
    favorable mortality in the life products of $109 million,
    contributing $10 million to the decrease in policyholder
    benefits and claims. Partially offsetting these decreases in
    policyholder benefits and claims was an increase in annuity
    benefits of $46 million primarily due to higher costs of
    the guaranteed annuity benefit riders and the related hedging,
    and revisions to future policyholder benefits.

Partially offsetting these decreases, interest credited to
    policyholder account balances increased by $51 million.
    Lower amortization of the excess interest reserves on acquired
    annuity and universal life blocks of business resulting from
    higher lapses in the prior period, as well as an update of
    assumptions in the current period contributed $40 million
    to the increase. In addition, interest credited on the general
    account portion of investment-type products increased
    $16 million, while other businesses decreased by
    $5 million. Of the $16 million increase on



the general account portion of investment-type products,
    management attributed $37 million to higher crediting
    rates, partially offset by $21 million due to lower average
    policyholder account balances.

Partially offsetting these decreases in total expenses was a
    $27 million increase in policyholder dividends associated
    with growth in the business.

Lower other expenses of $94 million include lower DAC
    amortization of $174 million resulting from changes in
    investment gains and losses of $154 million and
    $20 million related to management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross margins. The
    remaining increase in other expenses was $80 million. The
    current year included higher general spending of
    $94 million primarily due to information technology and
    travel expenses while the prior year had higher corporate
    incentives of $39 million related to the Travelers
    integration. In addition, the impact of revisions to certain
    expenses, premium tax, policyholder liabilities and pension and
    postretirement liabilities in both periods was a net increase to
    expenses of $25 million in the current period.

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $20 million, or 5%, to
    $436 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $416 million for the comparable 2006 period.

The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an
    increase in premiums of $28 million, net of income tax. The
    increase in premiums was principally due to an increase of
    $38 million, net of income tax, related to increased
    exposures, an increase of $4 million, net of income tax,
    from various voluntary and involuntary programs and an increase
    of $4 million, net of income tax, resulting from the change
    in estimate on auto rate refunds due to a regulatory
    examination. Offsetting these increases was a $14 million,
    net of income tax, decrease related to a reduction in average
    earned premium per policy and an increase in catastrophe
    reinsurance costs of $4 million, net of income tax.



In addition, net investment income increased by
    $12 million, net of income tax, due primarily to a
    realignment of economic capital and an increase in net
    investment income from higher yields, somewhat offset by a lower
    asset base. Net investment gains (losses) increased by
    $11 million, net of income tax, for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year.

In addition, other revenues increased by $16 million, net
    of income tax, due primarily to slower than anticipated claims
    payments in 2006 resulting in slower recognition of deferred
    income in 2006 related to a reinsurance contract as compared to
    2007.

Negatively impacting net income were additional policyholder
    benefits and claims of $60 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to $39 million, $20 million, and
    $16 million, all net of income tax, of losses related to
    higher claim frequencies, higher earned exposures and higher
    losses due to severity, respectively. In addition, a
    $13 million increase, net of income tax, in unallocated
    claims adjusting expenses and an increase of $12 million,
    net of income tax, from a reduction in favorable development of
    prior year losses negatively impacted net income. Offsetting
    these increases was a $41 million, net of income tax,
    decrease in catastrophe losses, which included favorable
    development of prior year catastrophe reserves of
    $10 million, net of income tax.

In addition, there was a decrease of $1 million, net of
    income tax, in policyholder dividends that positively impacted
    net income.

Also favorably impacting net income was a reduction of
    $10 million, net of income tax, in other expenses related
    to lower information technology and advertising costs.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $84 million, or 3%, to $3,207 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 from $3,123 million
    for the comparable 2006 period.

Premiums increased by $42 million due principally to a
    $59 million increase in premiums related to increased
    exposures, an increase of $5 million from various voluntary
    and involuntary programs and an increase in premiums of
    $5 million, resulting from the change in estimate on auto
    rate refunds due to a regulatory examination. Offsetting these
    increases was a $21 million decrease related to a reduction
    in average earned premium per policy and an increase in
    catastrophe reinsurance costs of $6 million.

Net investment income increased by $19 million due to a
    realignment of economic capital and an increase in net
    investment income from higher yields, somewhat offset by a lower
    asset base.

In addition, other revenues increased $23 million due
    primarily to slower than anticipated claims payments resulting
    in slower recognition of deferred income in 2006 related to a
    reinsurance contract as compared to 2007.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $73 million, or 3%, to
    $2,641 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $2,568 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $90 million
    which was primarily due to an increase of $59 million from
    higher claim frequencies, as a result of a return to normal
    weather patterns in 2007 compared to the milder weather in 2006
    across the majority of the country, and a $25 million and
    $30 million increase in losses related to higher severity
    and higher earned exposures, respectively. In addition, an
    increase of $20 million in unallocated loss adjustment
    expenses, primarily resulting from an increase in claims-related
    information technology costs, and a $19 million decrease in
    favorable development of prior year losses, representing
    $148 million of favorable development for 2007 as compared
    to $167 million for the 2006 period, increased policyholder
    benefits and claims. Offsetting these increases in losses was a
    decrease of $63 million in catastrophe losses, which
    includes $15 million of favorable loss development from
    prior year catastrophes.

Policyholder dividends decreased by $2 million in 2007 as
    compared to the prior year.

Other expenses decreased by $15 million primarily related
    to lower information technology and advertising costs, partially
    offset by minor changes in a variety of expense categories.



Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were favorable for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, although lower than the comparable
    period of 2006, as the combined ratio, excluding catastrophes,
    increased to 86.3% from 82.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $192 million, or 86%, to
    $416 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $224 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a loss
    in the third quarter of 2005 from Hurricane Katrina of
    $124 million, net of income tax, related to losses, loss
    adjusting expenses and reinstatement and additional
    reinsurance-related premiums and a loss in the fourth quarter of
    2005 related to losses and expenses from Hurricane Wilma of
    $32 million, net of income tax. Excluding the losses from
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, net income increased by
    $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    the comparable 2005 period.

Favorable development of prior year loss reserves contributed
    $72 million, net of income tax, to the increase in net
    income. In addition, an improvement in non-catastrophe loss
    experience, primarily due to improved frequencies, contributed
    $16 million, net of income tax and a reduction in loss
    adjustment expenses, primarily due to improved claims handling
    practices, contributed $13 million, net of income tax, to
    the increase. The increase in net income was offset by higher
    catastrophe losses in the current year, excluding the impact of
    Katrina and Wilma, resulting in a decrease to net income of
    $49 million, net of income tax.

Also impacting net income was a decrease in net earned premiums,
    excluding the impact of Hurricane Katrina, of $19 million,
    net of income tax, resulting primarily from an increase of
    $16 million, net of income tax, in catastrophe reinsurance
    costs and a reduction of $4 million, net of income tax, in
    involuntary assumed business, offset by an increase in premiums
    of $1 million, net of income tax, primarily from increased
    exposures, mostly offset by lower average premium per policy.

In addition, other revenues decreased by $7 million, net of
    income tax, due to slower than anticipated claims payments
    resulting in slower recognition of deferred income related to a
    reinsurance contract. Net investment income decreased by
    $3 million, net of income tax, due to a $12 million
    decrease in net investment income related to a realignment of
    economic capital, partially offset by a $9 million increase
    in income as a result of a slightly higher asset base. Net
    investment gains (losses) increased $10 million, net of
    income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared
    to the comparable 2005 period. Other expenses increased by
    $11 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    expenditures related to information technology, advertising and
    compensation costs.

The change in effective tax rates between periods accounted for
    the remainder of the increase in net income.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    decreased by $2 million, or less than 1%, to
    $3,123 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $3,125 million for the comparable 2005 period.

Premiums increased by $13 million due principally to the
    existence of a $43 million charge for reinstatement and
    additional reinsurance premiums in the third quarter of 2005
    related to Hurricane Katrina. Premiums decreased by
    $30 million year over year after giving consideration to
    this charge. This decrease resulted from $25 million in
    additional catastrophe reinsurance costs and a decrease of
    $6 million in involuntary assumed business in 2006, mainly
    associated with the Massachusetts involuntary market. These
    changes were partially offset by an increase in premiums of
    $35 million resulting from increased exposures, offset by a
    $34 million decrease in premiums from a change in the
    average earned premium per policy.

Net investment income decreased by $4 million primarily due
    to an $18 million decrease in net investment income related
    to a realignment of economic capital, mostly offset by a
    $14 million increase in income as a result of a slightly
    higher asset base with slightly higher yields.



Other revenues decreased by $11 million due to slower than
    anticipated claims payments resulting in a slower recognition of
    deferred income related to a reinsurance contract.

Expenses

Total expenses decreased by $257 million, or 9%, to
    $2,568 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $2,825 million for the comparable 2005 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $277 million
    which was primarily due to $196 million in claims and
    expenses related to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma incurred in
    2005. The remainder of the decrease in policyholder benefits and
    claims for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to
    the same period in 2005, can be attributed to $111 million
    in additional favorable development of prior year losses,
    improvements in claim frequencies of $72 million and a
    decrease of $20 million in unallocated loss expense due
    primarily to improved claims handling practices. These decreases
    in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005,
    were partially offset by $32 million of additional losses
    due to severity, $15 million of additional losses due to
    exposure growth and a $75 million increase in catastrophe
    losses, excluding Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma.

Other expenses increased by $17 million primarily due to
    expenditures related to information technology, advertising and
    compensation costs.

Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were favorable for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, as the combined ratio, excluding
    catastrophes, decreased to 82.8% from 86.7% for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $472 million, or 274%, to $644 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $172 million for the
    comparable 2006 period. This increase includes the impact of net
    investment gains of $42 million, net of income tax.

Excluding the impact of net investment gains (losses), income
    from continuing operations increased by $430 million from
    the comparable 2006 period.

Income from continuing operations increased in:

•

Argentina by $146 million, net of income tax, primarily due
    to a net reduction of liabilities by $48 million, net of
    income tax, resulting from pension reform. Additionally,
    $66 million of a valuation allowance related to a deferred
    tax asset established in connection with such pension reform
    liabilities was reduced, resulting in a commensurate increase in
    income from continuing operations. Under the reform plan, fund
    administrators are no longer liable for death and disability
    claims of the plan participants, however administrators retain
    the obligation for administering certain existing and future
    participants’ accounts for which they receive no revenue.
    Also contributing is the favorable impact of reductions in claim
    liabilities resulting from experience reviews in both the
    current and prior years, higher premiums primarily due to higher
    pension contributions attributable to higher participant
    salaries, higher net investment income resulting from capital
    contributions in the prior year, and a smaller increase in
    market indexed policyholder liabilities without a corresponding
    decrease in net investment income, partially offset by the
    reduction of cost of insurance fees as a result of the new
    pension system reform regulation, an increase in retention
    incentives related to pension reform, as well as lower trading
    portfolio income. Argentina also benefited, in both the current
    and prior years, from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards
    against which valuation allowances had previously been
    established, and in the current year from the reduction of
    valuation allowances due to expected realizability of deferred
    tax assets.

•

Mexico by $139 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities caused by a
    decrease in the unrealized investment results on invested assets
    supporting those liabilities relative to the prior year, the
    favorable impact of experience refunds during the first quarter
    of 2007 in its institutional business, a reduction in claim
    liabilities resulting from experience reviews, the adverse
    impact in the prior year of an adjustment for experience refunds
    in its institutional business, a year over year decrease in DAC
    amortization as a result of management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits in both
    the current and prior years, a decrease in liabilities based on
    a review of outstanding remittances, as well as growth in its
    institutional and universal life businesses. These increases
    were offset by lower fees resulting from management’s
    update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits,
    the favorable impact in the prior year associated with a large
    group policy that was not renewed by the policyholder, a
    decrease in various one-time revenue items, lower investment
    yields, the favorable impact in the prior year of liabilities
    related to employment matters that were reduced, and the benefit
    in the prior year from the elimination of liabilities for
    pending claims that were determined to be invalid following a
    review.

•

Taiwan by $51 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    an increase in DAC amortization in the prior year due to a loss
    recognition adjustment and prior year restructuring costs of
    $11 million associated with the termination of the agency
    distribution channel, partially offset by the favorable impact
    of liability refinements in the prior year and higher
    policyholder liabilities related to loss recognition in the
    prior year.

•

Brazil by $37 million, net of income tax, due to the
    unfavorable impact of increases in policyholder liabilities due
    to higher than expected mortality on specific blocks of business
    in the prior year, an increase in litigation liabilities in the
    prior year and the unfavorable impact of the reversal of a tax
    credit in the prior year, as well as growth of the in-force
    business.

•

Ireland by $19 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    the utilization of net operating losses for which a valuation
    allowance had been previously established as well as higher
    investment income resulting from



higher invested assets from a capital contribution, partially
    offset by higher

start-up

expenses and currency transaction losses.

•

Japan by $22 million, net of income tax, due to improved
    hedge results and business growth, partially offset by the
    impact of foreign currency transaction losses.

•

Hong Kong by $9 million, net of income tax, due to the
    acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and
    the resulting consolidation of the operation, as well as
    business growth.

•

Chile by $8 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    continued growth of the in-force business, higher joint venture
    income and higher returns on inflation indexed securities,
    partially offset by higher compensation, infrastructure and
    marketing expenses.

•

The United Kingdom by $3 million, net of income tax, due to
    a reduction of claim liabilities resulting from an experience
    review, offset by an unearned premium calculation refinement.

•

Australia by $1 million, net of income tax, due to changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates offset by higher claims and
    business growth.

Partially offsetting these increases, income from continuing
    operations decreased in:

•

The home office by $9 million, net of income tax, due to
    higher economic capital charges and investment expenses of
    $16 million, net of income tax, a $3 million increase
    in contingent tax expenses in the current year, as well as
    higher spending on growth and initiatives, partially offset by
    the elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously
    charged to the International segment and a tax benefit
    associated with a prior year income tax expense of
    $7 million related to a revision of an estimate.

•

India by $3 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    headcount increases and growth initiatives, as well as the
    impact of valuation allowances established against losses in
    both years.

•

South Korea by $4 million, net of income tax, due to a
    favorable impact in the prior year of $38 million, net of
    income tax, in DAC amortization associated with the
    implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system, as
    well as additional expenses in the current year associated with
    growth and infrastructure initiatives, partially offset by
    continued growth in its variable universal life business, lower
    DAC amortization in the variable universal life business due to
    favorable market performance and a lower increase in claim
    liabilities.

The remainder of the change in income from continuing operations
    can be attributed to contributions from the other countries.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $858 million, or 19%, to $5,362 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $4,504 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $560 million, or 16%, to $4,114 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $3,554 million for the
    comparable 2006 period.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in:

•

Mexico by $133 million primarily due to higher fees and
    growth in its institutional and universal life businesses, a
    decrease of $13 million in experience refunds during the
    first quarter of 2007 on Mexico’s institutional business,
    as well as the adverse impact in the prior year of an adjustment
    for experience refunds on Mexico’s institutional business.
    These increases were offset by lower fees resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits, and various one-time revenue items for
    which the prior year benefited by $16 million and the
    current year benefited by $4 million.

•

Hong Kong by $98 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation, as well as business growth.



•

Chile by $94 million primarily due to higher annuity sales
    resulting from a higher interest rate environment, improved
    competitive conditions and an expected rate increase in 2008,
    higher institutional premiums from its traditional and bank
    distribution channels, as well as the decrease in the prior year
    resulting from management’s decision not to match
    aggressive pricing in the marketplace.

•

South Korea by $90 million primarily due to higher fees
    from growth in its guaranteed annuity business and variable
    universal life business.

•

Brazil by $35 million primarily due to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates and business growth.

•

The Company’s Japan operation by $31 million due to an
    increase in reinsurance assumed.

•

Australia by $26 million as a result of growth in the
    institutional and reinsurance in-force business, an increase in
    retention levels and changes in the foreign currency exchange
    rates.

•

Argentina by $21 million primarily due to an increase in
    premiums and fees from higher pension contributions resulting
    from higher participant salaries and a higher salary threshold
    subject to fees and growth in bancassurance, partially offset by
    the reduction of cost of insurance fees as a result of the new
    pension system reform regulation.

•

Taiwan and India by $21 million and $11 million,
    respectively, primarily due to business growth.

Partially offsetting these increases, premiums, fees and other
    revenues decreased in:

•

The United Kingdom by $3 million due to an unearned premium
    calculation refinement partially offset by changes in foreign
    currency rates.

The remainder of the change in premiums, fees and other revenues
    can be attributed to contributions from the other countries.

Net investment income increased by $298 million, or 31%, to
    $1,248 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $950 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Net investment income increased in:

•

Chile by $148 million due to the impact of higher inflation
    rates on indexed securities, the valuations and returns of which
    are linked to inflation rates, higher joint venture income, as
    well as an increase in invested assets.

•

Mexico by $46 million due to an increase in invested
    assets, partially offset by a decrease in yields, exclusive of
    inflation.

•

Hong Kong by $43 million primarily due to the acquisition
    of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Japan by $19 million due to an increase of $52 million
    from hedging activities associated with Japan’s guaranteed
    annuity, offset by a decrease of $33 million, net of income
    tax, in the Company’s investment in Japan primarily due to
    an increase in the costs of guaranteed annuity benefits and the
    impact of foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset
    by business growth.

•

South Korea and Taiwan by $24 million and $6 million,
    respectively, primarily due to increases in invested assets.

•

Brazil by $14 million primarily due to increases in
    invested assets as well as changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates.

•

Australia by $12 million due to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates, higher yields and increases in invested assets.

•

Ireland by $9 million due to an increase in invested assets
    resulting from capital contributions.

•

India by $4 million due to an increase in invested assets,
    as well as higher yields.



Partially offsetting these increases in net investment income
    was a decrease in:

•

The home office of $25 million primarily due to an increase
    in the amount charged for economic capital and investment
    management expenses.

•

Argentina by $7 million primarily due to unfavorable
    results in the trading portfolio, partially offset by higher
    invested assets resulting from capital contributions in the
    prior year. Additionally, net investment income in the prior
    year did not decrease correspondingly with the decrease in
    policyholder benefits and claims discussed below because the
    prior year did not include interest- and inflation-indexed
    assets to support such liabilities.

The remainder of the change in net investment income can be
    attributed to contributions from the other countries.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a
    $106 million increase in total revenues, excluding net
    investment gains (losses).

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $338 million, or 8%, to
    $4,565 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $4,227 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by
    $119 million, or 4%, to $2,817 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $2,698 million for the
    comparable 2006 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased in:

•

Chile by $221 million primarily due to an increase in
    inflation indexed policyholder liabilities as well as growth in
    its annuity and institutional businesses.

•

Hong Kong by $119 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Taiwan by $65 million primarily due to a decrease of
    $14 million in the prior year from liability refinements
    associated with the conversion to a new valuation system, as
    well as higher policyholder liabilities related to loss
    recognition in the fourth quarter of 2006 and growth in the
    business.

•

South Korea by $27 million primarily due to business growth
    as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially
    offset by a lower increase in claims liabilities resulting from
    a change in the reinsurance allowance in the prior year.

•

Australia by $23 million due to higher claims, an increase
    in retention levels, business growth and changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates.

•

India by $4 million due to higher claims and business
    growth, partially offset by management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits.

Partially offsetting these increases in policyholder benefits
    and claims, policyholder dividends and interest credited to
    policyholder account balances were decreases in:

•

Argentina by $250 million primarily due to the elimination
    of liabilities for claims and premium deficiencies of
    $208 million resulting from pension reform. Under the
    reform plan, which is effective January 1, 2008, fund
    administrators are no longer liable for new death and disability
    claims of the plan participants. Also contributing is a decrease
    in interest- and market-indexed policyholder liabilities and the
    favorable impact of reductions in claim liabilities resulting
    from experience reviews in both the current and prior years.

•

Mexico by $63 million, primarily due to a decrease in
    certain policyholder liabilities of $117 million caused by
    a decrease in the unrealized investment results on the invested
    assets supporting those liabilities relative to the prior year
    and a reduction in claim liabilities resulting from experience
    reviews, offset by an increase



of $10 million due to a decrease in the prior year of
    policyholder benefits associated with a large group policy that
    was not renewed by the policyholder, an increase of
    $6 million due to a benefit in the prior year from the
    elimination of liabilities for pending claims that were
    determined to be invalid following a review, as well as business
    growth.

•

Brazil of $13 million primarily due to the impact in the
    prior year of increases in policyholder liabilities from higher
    than expected mortality on specific blocks of business,
    partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

•

The United Kingdom by $8 million, due to a reduction of
    claim liabilities based on a review of experience.

Decreases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Other expenses increased by $219 million, or 14%, to
    $1,748 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $1,529 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Other expenses increased in:

•

Argentina by $153 million, primarily due to a liability of
    $128 million for servicing obligations that was established
    as a result of pension reform. Under the reform plan, which is
    effective January 1, 2008, the Company retains the
    obligation for administering certain existing and future
    participants’ accounts for which they receive no revenue.
    Also contributing is an increase in commissions on bancassurance
    business, an increase in retention incentives related to pension
    reform, the impact of management’s update of DAC
    assumptions as a result of pension reform and growth, partially
    offset by a lower increase in liabilities due to inflation and
    exchange rate indexing.

•

South Korea by $92 million, primarily due to the favorable
    impact in the prior year of $60 million in DAC amortization
    associated with the implementation of a more refined reserve
    valuation system and additional expenses in the current year
    associated with growth and infrastructure initiatives, as well
    as business growth and higher bank insurance fees, partially
    offset by a decrease in DAC amortization related to market
    performance.

•

Mexico by $27 million primarily due to higher expenses
    related to business growth and the favorable impact in the prior
    year of liabilities related to employment matters that were
    reduced, offset by a decrease in DAC amortization resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits in both the current and prior years, and
    a decrease in liabilities based on a review of outstanding
    remittances.

•

India by $14 million primarily due to headcount increases
    and growth initiatives, partially offset by the impact of
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits.

•

Australia by $12 million primarily due to business growth
    and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Chile by $12 million primarily due to higher compensation
    costs, higher spending on infrastructure and marketing programs
    and growth, partially offset by a decrease in DAC amortization
    related to inflation indexing.

•

Hong Kong by $11 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Ireland by $10 million due to additional

start-up

costs, as well as $5 million of foreign currency
    transaction losses.

•

Brazil by $9 million primarily due to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in
    litigation liabilities in the prior year.

•

The United Kingdom by $2 million due to changes in foreign
    currency rates and higher spending on business initiatives,
    partially offset by lower DAC amortization resulting from
    calculation refinements.



Partially offsetting these increases in other expenses were
    decreases in:

•

Taiwan by $118 million primarily due to a one-time increase
    in DAC amortization in the prior year of $77 million due to
    a loss recognition adjustment resulting from low interest rates
    relative to product guarantees coupled with high persistency
    rates on certain blocks of business, an increase in DAC
    amortization in the prior year associated with the
    implementation of a new valuation system, expenses of
    $17 million in the prior year related the termination of
    the agency distribution channel and expense reductions
    recognized in the current year due to elimination of the agency
    distribution channel.

•

The home office of $4 million primarily due to the
    elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously charged
    to the International Segment, offset by higher spending on
    growth and infrastructure initiatives.

Decreases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a
    $105 million increase in total expenses.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005 — International

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased by $14 million,
    or 8%, to $172 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006 from $186 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $20 million during the
    first six months of 2006 to income from continuing operations,
    which includes $3 million, net of income tax, of net
    investment gains. Included in the Travelers results is an
    increase to policyholder benefits and claims of
    $10 million, net of income tax, resulting from the increase
    in policyholder liabilities due to higher than expected
    mortality in Brazil on specific blocks of business written in
    the Travelers entity since the acquisition, and consistent with
    the increase in the existing MetLife entity as described more
    fully below. Excluding the impact of Travelers, income from
    continuing operations decreased by $34 million, or 18%,
    from the comparable 2005 period. This decrease includes the
    impact of net investment gains (losses) of ($17) million,
    net of income tax. Excluding the impact of Travelers and of net
    investment gains (losses), income from continuing operations
    decreased by $17 million from the comparable 2005 period.

Income from continuing operations decreased in:

•

Taiwan by $59 million, net of income tax, due to a loss
    recognition adjustment (in the form of accelerated DAC
    amortization) of $50 million, net of income tax, and
    restructuring costs of $11 million, net of income tax,
    partially offset by reserve refinements of $3 million, net
    of income tax, associated with the conversion to a new valuation
    system.

•

Canada by $19 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    the realignment of economic capital in the prior year.

•

Mexico by $12 million, net of income tax, due to an
    increase in amortization of DAC resulting from management’s
    update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross margins
    in both years, higher operating expenses from the pension
    business, the net impact of an adjustment to the liability for
    experience refunds on a block of business, a decrease in various
    one-time other revenue items for which the prior year benefited
    by $13 million, net of income tax, and the current year
    benefited by $11 million, net of income tax, as well as an
    increase of $27 million in tax due to tax benefits realized
    in the prior year from the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (“AJCA”).These were partially offset by a decrease in
    certain policyholder liabilities caused by a decrease in
    unrealized investment gains on invested assets supporting those
    liabilities relative to the prior year, a decrease in
    policyholder benefits associated with a large group policy that
    was not renewed by the policyholder, a benefit in the current
    year from the elimination of liabilities for pending claims that
    were determined to be invalid following a review, the
    unfavorable impact in the prior year of contingent liabilities
    that were established related to potential employment matters in
    that year and which were eliminated in the current year as well
    as overall business growth.

•

Brazil by $7 million, net of income tax, primarily due to a
    $10 million, net of income tax, increase in policyholder
    benefits and claims related to an increase in future
    policyholder benefit liabilities on specific



blocks of business. This increase is due to significantly higher
    than expected mortality experience, of which a total of
    $20 million, net of income tax, of additional liabilities
    were recorded, $10 million, net of income tax, of which was
    associated with the acquired Travelers’ business, and of
    which $10 million, net of income tax, was related to the
    existing MetLife entities. Brazil’s income from continuing
    operations was also impacted by an increase in litigation
    liabilities, as well as adverse claim experience in the current
    year.

•

The Company’s investment in Japan by $4 million, net
    of income tax, due to variability in the hedging program.

•

The home office by $49 million primarily due to recorded
    higher infrastructure expenditures in support of segment growth
    of $39 million, net of income tax, as well as a
    $23 million, net of income tax, contingent tax liability.
    This was offset by an increase in income from continuing
    operations of $13 million, net of income tax, due to a
    reduction in the amount charged for economic capital.

•

The Company’s operation in Ireland reduced operating income
    by $34 million, net of income tax, due to

start-up

expenses in the current year. A valuation allowance was
    established against the deferred income tax benefit resulting
    from the Ireland losses.

Partially offsetting these decreases in income from continuing
    operations were increases in:

•

South Korea by $79 million, net of income tax, primarily
    due to continued growth of the in-force business, a one-time
    benefit of $38 million, net of income tax, associated with
    the implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system,
    as well as a benefit of $13 million from the impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Argentina by $61 million, net of income tax, due to higher
    net investment income resulting from capital contributions since
    the completion of the Travelers acquisition, the release of
    liabilities for pending claims that were determined to be
    invalid following a review, the favorable impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates and inflation rates on certain
    contingent liabilities, the utilization of $4 million of
    net operating losses for which a valuation allowance had been
    previously established, a $12 million increase in the prior
    year period of a deferred income tax valuation allowance
    established against tax benefits in that year, as well as
    business growth.

•

Australia by $22 million, net of income tax, primarily due
    to reserve strengthening on a block of business in the prior
    year, as well as business growth.

•

Chile by $5 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    growth in the institutional business of $2 million, as well
    as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of
    $2 million.

•

The United Kingdom by $5 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to growth of the in-force business.

The remainder of the decrease in income from continuing
    operations can be attributed to other countries. Changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates accounted for $2 million of
    the increase in income from continuing operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $925 million, or 26%, to $4,504 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $3,579 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $366 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the period over period increase.
    Excluding the impact of Travelers, such revenues increased by
    $559 million, or 16%, over the comparable 2005 period.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $469 million, or 17%, to $3,254 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $2,785 million for the
    comparable 2005 period.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in:

•

Mexico by $159 million, primarily due to higher fees and
    growth in its universal life and institutional business,
    partially offset by an adjustment for experience refunds on a
    block of business and various one-



time other revenue items for which the prior year benefited by
    $19 million and the current year benefited by
    $16 million.

•

South Korea by $156 million primarily due to business
    growth driven by strong sales of its variable universal life
    product, as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency
    exchange rates of $56 million.

•

Brazil by $49 million due to business growth and higher
    bancassurance business, as well as an increase in amounts
    retained under reinsurance arrangements.

•

Chile by $22 million primarily due to the favorable impact
    of foreign currency exchange rates of $14 million, as well
    as an increase in institutional premiums through its bank
    distribution channel, partially offset by lower annuity sales
    due in part from management’s decision not to match
    aggressive pricing in the marketplace.

•

The United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, and Taiwan by
    $21 million, $16 million, $15 million, and
    $12 million respectively, primarily due to business growth.

Increases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Net investment income increased by $90 million, or 11%, to
    $884 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $794 million for the comparable 2005 period.

Net investment income increased in:

•

Argentina by $41 million primarily due to higher invested
    assets resulting from capital contributions since the completion
    of the Travelers acquisition.

•

Mexico by $28 million primarily due to higher inflation
    rates and increases in invested assets, partially offset by
    lower average investment yields.

•

South Korea, Brazil and Taiwan by $25 million,
    $14 million and $5 million, respectively, primarily
    due to increases in invested assets, as well as the favorable
    impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $10 million.

•

Home office by $17 million primarily due to a reduction in
    the amount charged for economic capital from the prior year.

Partially offsetting these increases in net investment income
    were decreases in:

•

Chile by $8 million primarily due to a reduction in the
    inflation rate, partially offset by the favorable impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates of $8 million and increases
    in invested assets. The invested asset valuations and returns on
    these invested assets are linked to inflation rates in most of
    the Latin American countries in which the Company does business.

•

Canada by $33 million due to the realignment of economic
    capital.

Increases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable
    impact of $105 million on total revenues, excluding net
    investment gains (losses).

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $857 million, or 25%, to
    $4,227 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $3,370 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $346 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase.
    Excluding the impact of Travelers, total expenses increased by
    $511 million, or 15%, over the comparable 2005 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by
    $187 million, or 8%, to $2,560 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $2,373 million for the
    comparable 2005 period.



Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased in:

•

Mexico by $113 million primarily due to an increase in
    other policyholder benefits and claims of $108 million and
    in interest credited to policyholder account balances of
    $39 million commensurate with the growth in revenue
    discussed above. These increases in Mexico were partially offset
    by a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities of
    $18 million caused by a decrease in the unrealized
    investment gains on the invested assets supporting those
    liabilities, a $10 million benefit from a decrease in
    policyholder benefits associated with a large group policy that
    was not renewed by the policyholder, and a $6 million
    benefit in the current year from the elimination of liabilities
    for pending claims that were determined to be invalid following
    a review.

•

Brazil by $49 million primarily due to an increase in
    policyholder liabilities on these specific blocks of business as
    discussed above, an increase in amounts retained under
    reinsurance arrangements, as well as adverse claim experience in
    other lines of business.

•

South Korea by $44 million commensurate with the business
    growth discussed above, as well as the impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates of $33 million.

Partially offsetting these increases, policyholder benefits and
    claims, policyholder dividends, and interest credited to
    policyholder account balances decreased in:

•

Australia by $22 million due to reserve strengthening in
    the prior year on a block of reinsurance business.

•

Chile by $7 million primarily due to a decrease in annuity
    liabilities related to the decrease in the inflation index and
    the decrease in annuity premiums discussed above, partially
    offset by growth in the institutional business, as well as the
    impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $17 million.

•

Taiwan by $2 million primarily due to a decrease of
    $14 million from reserve refinements associated with the
    implementation of a new valuation system, partially offset by an
    increase of $12 million primarily due to business growth.

•

Argentina by $2 million primarily due to the elimination of
    liabilities for pending claims that were determined to be
    invalid following a review, partially offset by business growth.
    Increases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Other expenses increased by $324 million, or 32%, to
    $1,321 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $997 million for the comparable 2005 period.

Other expenses increased in:

•

Taiwan by $110 million primarily due to a one-time increase
    in DAC amortization of $77 million due to a loss
    recognition adjustment resulting from low interest rates
    relative to product guarantees coupled with high persistency
    rates on certain blocks of business, an increase of
    $17 million related to the termination of the agency
    distribution channel in Taiwan, an increase of $9 million
    from refinements associated with the implementation of a new
    valuation system, as well as business growth.

•

Mexico by $49 million primarily due to an increase in
    commissions commensurate with the revenue growth discussed
    above, higher DAC amortization resulting from management’s
    update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits
    in both the current and prior years, higher expenses related to
    growth initiatives, and additional expenses associated with the
    Mexican pension business, partially offset by the favorable
    impact of contingent liabilities that were established in the
    prior year related to potential employment matters and which
    were eliminated in the current year.

•

South Korea by $25 million, primarily due to an increase in
    DAC amortization and general expenses, which were both due to
    the growth in business, the impact in the prior year of an
    accrual for an early retirement program and the impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates of $15 million. These were
    partially offset by a decrease of $60 million in DAC
    amortization associated with the implementation of a more
    refined reserve valuation system.



•

Brazil by $25 million primarily due to the growth in
    business discussed above, as well as an increase in litigation
    liabilities.

•

Chile by $13 million due to increased commissions and other
    expenses associated with its institutional business, as well as
    the impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4 million.

•

The United Kingdom and Australia by $15 million and
    $3 million, respectively, primarily due to business growth.

•

Home office by $57 million primarily due to an increase in
    expenditures for information technology projects, growth
    initiative projects and integration costs, as well as an
    increase in compensation resulting from an increase in headcount
    from the comparable 2005 period.

•

Ireland by $34 million primarily related to the

start-up

of
    the Company’s operation in Ireland.

Offsetting these increases, other expenses decreased in:

•

Argentina by $9 million primarily due to the favorable
    impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation rates on
    certain contingent liabilities.

Increases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for
    $90 million of the increase in total expenses.

Year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2006 — Reinsurance

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $15 million, or 13%, to
    $133 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
    2007 from $118 million for the comparable 2006 period.

The increase in net income was attributable to a 13% increase in
    premiums while policyholder benefits and claims increased by
    14%, a 19% increase in net investment income while interest
    credited to policyholder account



balances increased by 3%, and a 17% increase in other revenues.
    The increase in premiums, net of the increase in policyholder
    benefits and claims, added $41 million to net income, net
    of income tax, which was primarily due to additional business
    in-force from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal
    premiums on existing blocks of business in the U.S. and
    international operations. Policyholder benefits and claims as a
    percentage of premiums were 81% and are comparable to the prior
    year. The increase in net investment income, net of interest
    credited to policyholder account balances, added
    $85 million to net income and was due primarily to growth
    in the invested asset base. The increases in invested assets and
    net investment income, net of interest credited to policyholder
    account balances were substantially derived from the issuance of
    notes, which also increased interest expense within other
    expenses as described below. Additionally, positive operating
    cash flows and additional policyholder account balances
    contributed to the growth in the invested asset base. The
    increase in other revenues added $7 million to net income,
    net of income tax, and was primarily related to an increase in
    investment product fees on asset-intensive business and
    financial reinsurance fees during 2007.

A decrease in other expenses added $1 million to net
    income, net of income tax. The decrease in other expenses was
    primarily related to a reduction of expenses associated with
    DAC, including reinsurance allowances paid, offset by an
    increase in interest, expense compensation and overhead-related
    expenses associated with RGA’s international expansion, and
    minority interest expense. The increase in interest expense is
    associated with the issuance of $850 million

30-year

notes in June 2006 by a subsidiary of RGA to provide long-term
    collateral for Regulation XXX statutory reserves,
    RGA’s issuance of $300 million senior notes in March
    2007, and FIN 48 interest expense.

These increases in net income were partially offset by a
    $120 million increase in net investment losses, net of
    income tax. The increase in net investment losses was primarily
    due to a decrease in the fair value of embedded derivatives
    associated with the reinsurance of annuity products on a funds
    withheld basis.

Additionally, a component of the increase in net income was a
    $4 million increase associated with foreign currency
    exchange rate movements.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $712 million, or 14%, to $5,858 million
    for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from
    $5,146 million for the comparable 2006 period.

The increase in revenues was primarily associated with growth in
    premiums of $562 million from new facultative and automatic
    treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business in
    all RGA operating segments, including the U.S., which
    contributed $221 million; Asia Pacific, which contributed
    $192 million; Europe and South Africa, which contributed
    $91 million; and Canada, which contributed
    $58 million. Premium levels are significantly influenced by
    large transactions and reporting practices of ceding companies
    and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period.

Net investment income increased by $139 million primarily
    due to growth in the invested asset base from net proceeds from
    the aforementioned notes offerings by RGA and its subsidiary,
    positive cash flows from operations, additional deposits
    associated with the coinsurance of annuity products, and a
    realignment of economic capital. The investment yield also
    increased slightly over the comparable prior year.

Other revenues increased by $11 million primarily due to an
    increase in surrender charges on asset-intensive business
    reinsured and an increase in fees associated with financial
    reinsurance.

Additionally, a component of the increase in total revenues,
    excluding net investment gains (losses), was a $128 million
    increase associated with foreign currency exchange rate
    movements.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $506 million, or 10%, to
    $5,477 million for the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2007 from $4,971 million for the
    comparable 2006 period.

This increase in total expenses was primarily attributable to an
    increase of $499 million in policyholder benefits and
    claims, primarily associated with a growth in insurance in-force
    of $179 billion, and an increase of



$8 million in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances. This increase in interest credited to policyholder
    account balances was more than offset by an increase in net
    investment income. In addition to the in-force growth, favorable
    mortality in the prior year in the international operations
    added to the increase in policyholder benefits and claims.

Other expenses decreased by $1 million due to a
    $79 million decrease in expenses associated with DAC,
    including reinsurance allowances paid, offset by a
    $41 million increase in interest expense associated with
    the aforementioned notes offerings by RGA and its subsidiary and
    the application of FIN 48, and an $7 million increase
    in minority interest expense. Included in the $79 million
    decrease in expenses associated with DAC was a $113 million
    reduction of DAC amortization due to the change in the value of
    embedded derivatives associated with modified coinsurance
    arrangements as a result of the impact of widening credit
    spreads in the U.S. debt markets. An offsetting increase of
    $30 million was primarily due to compensation and
    overhead-related expenses associated with RGA’s
    international expansion and general growth in operations,
    including equity compensation expense.

Additionally, a component of the increase in total expenses, was
    a $121 million increase associated with foreign currency
    exchange rate movements.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005 — Reinsurance

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $26 million, or 28%, to
    $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $92 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in net income was attributable to a 12% increase in
    premiums while policyholder benefits and claims increased by 9%,
    a 21% increase in net investment income while interest credited
    to policyholder account balances increased by 15%, and a 14%
    increase in other revenues. The increase in premiums, net of the
    increase in policyholder benefits and claims, added
    $127 million to net income which was primarily due to added
    business in-force from facultative and automatic treaties and
    renewal premiums on existing blocks of business in the
    U.S. and international operations. The increase in
    policyholder benefits and claims was partially offset by
    unfavorable mortality and an increase in the liabilities
    associated with RGA’s Argentine pension business, both in
    the prior-year period. The increase in net investment income and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances added
    $60 million to net income and was due to growth in the
    invested asset base. The increase in invested assets, and net
    investment income, substantially derived from the issuance of
    notes and a collateral financing facility, which increased
    interest expense within other expenses as described below. The
    increase in other revenues added $5 million to net income
    and was primarily related to an increase in investment product
    fees on asset-intensive business and financial reinsurance fees
    during 2006, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency
    transaction gains in the prior-year period.

These increases in net income were partially offset by a
    $153 million increase in other expenses and a
    $10 million decrease in net investment gains (losses), all
    net of income tax. Additionally, a higher effective tax rate in
    2006 reduced net income by $3 million. The increase in
    other expenses was primarily related to expenses associated with
    DAC, including reinsurance allowances paid, interest expense
    associated with RGA’s issuance of $850 million

30-year

notes to provide long-term collateral for Regulation XXX
    statutory reserves in June 2006 and $400 million of junior
    subordinated notes in December 2005, minority interest expense,
    and equity compensation expense.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $613 million, or 14%, to $5,146 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $4,533 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in such revenues was primarily associated with
    growth in premiums of $479 million from new facultative and
    automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of
    business in all RGA operating segments, including the U.S.,
    which contributed $220 million; Asia Pacific, which
    contributed $138 million; Canada, which contributed
    $86 million; and Europe and South Africa, which contributed
    $35 million. Premium



levels were significantly influenced by large transactions and
    reporting practices of ceding companies and, as a result, can
    fluctuate from period to period.

Net investment income increased by $126 million, primarily
    due to growth in the invested asset base from net proceeds of
    RGA’s $850 million

30-year

notes offering in June 2006 and $400 million junior
    subordinated note offering in December 2005, positive operating
    cash inflows and additional deposits associated with the
    coinsurance of annuity products. Investment yields were down
    slightly compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net
    investment income was partially offset by a decrease related to
    a realignment of economic capital.

Other revenues increased by $8 million primarily due to an
    increase in investment product fees on asset-intensive business
    and financial reinsurance fees during 2006, partially offset by
    a decrease in foreign currency transaction gains.

Additionally, a component of the increase in total revenues,
    excluding net investment gains (losses), was a $36 million
    increase associated with foreign currency exchange rate
    movements.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $554 million, or 13%, to
    $4,971 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $4,417 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in total expenses was commensurate with the growth
    in revenues and was primarily attributable to an increase of
    $284 million in policyholder benefits and claims, primarily
    associated with growth in insurance in-force of
    $245 billion, and a $34 million increase in interest
    credited due to growth in policyholder account balances
    associated with the coinsurance of annuity products, which is
    generally offset by a corresponding increase in net investment
    income. The increase in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $284 million was partially offset by favorable underwriting
    results in RGA’s international operations in the current
    year period, unfavorable mortality experience in the
    U.S. and the United Kingdom in the prior-year period, and a
    $33 million increase in the liabilities associated with the
    Argentine pension business in the prior year period.

Other expenses increased by $236 million due to a
    $92 million increase in expenses associated with DAC,
    including reinsurance allowances paid, a $47 million
    increase in interest expense primarily associated with
    RGA’s issuance of $850 million

30-year

notes in June 2006 and $400 million of junior subordinated
    notes in December 2005, as well as a $47 million increase
    in minority interest expense on the larger earnings base in the
    current period. The remaining increase of $50 million was
    primarily related to overhead-related expenses associated with
    RGA’s international expansion and general growth in
    operations, including equity compensation expense.

Additionally, a component of the increase in total expenses was
    a $33 million increase associated with foreign currency
    exchange rate movements.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $278 million, to a gain of $272 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from a loss of $6 million for
    the comparable 2006 period. Included in this increase were lower
    net investment losses of $132 million, net of income tax,
    resulting in a net investment gain. Excluding the impact of net
    investment gains (losses), income from continuing operations
    increased by $146 million.

The increase in income from continuing operations was primarily
    attributable to higher net investment income, lower corporate
    expenses, higher other revenues, integration costs incurred in
    the prior year, and lower legal cost of $269 million,
    $56 million, $19 million, $17 million, and
    $7 million, respectively, each of which were net of income
    tax. This was partially offset by higher interest expense on
    debt, higher interest on tax contingencies, and higher interest
    credited to bankholder deposits of $86 million,
    $23 million, and $3 million respectively, each of
    which were net of income tax. Tax benefits decreased by
    $103 million over the comparable 2006 period due to the
    Company’s implementation of FIN 48, the difference of
    finalizing the Company’s 2006 tax return in 2007 when
    compared to finalizing the Company’s 2005 tax return in
    2006 and the difference between the actual and the estimated tax
    rate allocated to the various segments.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $443 million, or 40%, to $1,558 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $1,115 million for the comparable 2006 period. This
    increase was primarily due to increased net investment income of
    $414 million, mainly on fixed maturity securities, driven
    by a higher asset base related to the reinvestment of proceeds
    from the sale of the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town
    properties during the fourth quarter of 2006 and the investment
    of proceeds from issuances of junior subordinated debt in
    December 2006 and December 2007 and collateral financing
    arrangements to support statutory



reserves in May 2007 and December 2007. Net investment income
    also increased on other limited partnerships, real estate and
    real estate joint ventures, and mortgage loans. Other revenues
    increased by $29 million primarily related to the
    resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the 2000
    acquisition of GALIC, offset by an adjustment of surrender
    values on corporate-owned life insurance policies. Also included
    as a component of total revenues was the elimination of
    intersegment amounts which was offset within total expenses.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $61 million, or 4%, to
    $1,447 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $1,386 million for the comparable 2006 period.
    Interest expense was higher by $133 million due to the
    issuances of junior subordinated debt in December 2006 and
    December 2007 and collateral financing arrangements in May 2007
    and December 2007, respectively, and from settlement fees on the
    prepayment of shares subject to mandatory redemption in October
    2007, partially offset by the maturity of senior notes in
    December 2006 and the reduction of commercial paper outstanding.
    Interest on tax contingencies was higher by $35 million as
    a result of an increase in published Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) interest rates and a change in the method of
    estimating interest expense on tax contingencies associated with
    the Company’s implementation of FIN 48. As a result of
    higher interest rates, interest credited on bank deposits
    increased by $5 million at MetLife Bank. Corporate expenses
    are lower by $86 million primarily due to lower corporate
    support expenses of $63 million, which included
    advertising,

start-up

costs for new products and information technology costs, and
    lower costs from reductions of MetLife Foundation contributions
    of $23 million. Integration costs incurred in 2006 period
    were $25 million. Legal costs were lower by
    $11 million primarily due to a reduction in the current
    year of $35 million of legal liabilities resulting from the
    settlement of certain cases, lower other legal costs of
    $3 million partially offset by higher amortization and
    valuation of an asbestos insurance recoverable of
    $27 million. Also included as a component of total expenses
    were the elimination of intersegment amounts which were offset
    within total revenues.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005 — Corporate &
    Other

Income
    (Loss) from Continuing Operations

Income (loss) from continuing operations increased by
    $15 million, or 71%, to ($6) million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from ($21) million for the
    comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers, excluding
    Travelers financing and integration costs incurred by the
    Company, contributed $111 million during the first six
    months of 2006 to income (loss) from continuing operations,
    which included $3 million, net of income tax, of net
    investment losses. Excluding the impact of Travelers, income
    (loss) from continuing operations decreased by $96 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the comparable
    2005 period. Included in this decrease were higher investment
    losses of $66 million, net of income tax. Excluding the
    impact of Travelers and the increase of net investment losses,
    income (loss) from continuing operations decreased by
    $30 million.

The increase in income (loss) from continuing operations was
    primarily attributable to higher net investment income, lower
    integration costs and higher other revenues of
    $104 million, $62 million, and $4 million,
    respectively, all of which were net of income tax. This was
    partially offset by higher interest expense on debt (principally
    associated with the issuance of debt to finance the Travelers
    acquisition), corporate support expenses, interest credited to
    bankholder deposits, policyholder benefits and claims and
    legal-related liabilities of $125 million,
    $111 million, $55 million, $30 million and
    $5 million, respectively, all of which were net of income
    tax. Tax benefits increased by $113 million over the
    comparable 2005 period due to the difference of finalizing the
    Company’s 2005 tax return in 2006 when compared to
    finalizing the Company’s 2004 tax return in 2005 and the
    difference between the actual and the estimated tax rate
    allocated to the various segments.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $363 million, or 48%, to $1,115 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $752 million
    for the comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers
    contributed $200 million during the first six months of
    2006 to the period over period increase. Excluding the impact of
    Travelers, revenues increased by $163 million, or 22%, from
    the comparable 2005 period. This increase was primarily
    attributable to increased net investment income of
    $171 million primarily from increases in



income on fixed maturity securities due to improved yields from
    lengthening of the duration and a higher asset base, and the
    impact of higher short-term interest rates on cash equivalents
    and short-term investments. The increase also resulted from a
    higher asset base invested in mortgage loans on real estate,
    real estate joint ventures, and other limited partnership
    interests and was partially offset by a decline in securities
    lending results and leveraged leases. The remainder of the
    increase was primarily attributable to increased other revenues
    of $5 million, which primarily consisted of increased
    surrender values on corporate owned life insurance policies.
    Also included as a component of total revenues were the
    intersegment eliminations which were offset within total
    expenses.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $446 million, or 47%, to
    $1,386 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $940 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers, excluding Travelers financing and
    integration costs, contributed $59 million during the first
    six months of 2006 to the period over period increase. Excluding
    the impact of Travelers, total expenses increased by
    $387 million, or 41%, for the year ended December 31,
    2006 from the comparable 2005 period.

This increase was primarily attributable to higher interest
    expense of $192 million. The principal reason was a result
    of the issuance of senior notes in 2005, which included
    $119 million of expenses from the financing of the
    acquisition of Travelers. Additionally, as a result of the
    issuance of commercial paper, short-term interest expense
    increased by $67 million. Corporate support expenses were
    higher by $170 million primarily due to higher corporate
    support expenses of $107 million, which included
    advertising,

start-up

costs for new products and information technology costs, a
    $35 million MetLife foundation contribution in the 2006
    period and a $28 million benefit, in the 2005 period,
    associated with the reduction of a previously established real
    estate transfer tax liability related to MLIC’s
    demutualization in 2000. As a result of growth in the business
    and higher interest rates, interest credited to bankholder
    deposits increased by $85 million at MetLife Bank.
    Policyholder benefits and claims increased $47 million from
    a 2005 period benefit associated with a reduction of a
    previously established liability for settlement death benefits
    related to the Company’s sales practices class action
    settlement recorded in 1999. Legal-related costs were higher by
    $8 million, predominantly from the reduction of previously
    established liabilities related to legal disputes during the
    2005 period. Integration costs were lower by $95 million.
    Also included as a component of total expenses were the
    elimination of intersegment amounts which were offset within
    total revenues.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The
    Company

Capital

RBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the
    National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) and the state insurance departments to
    identify companies that merit further regulatory action. RBC is
    based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various
    asset, premium and statutory reserve items. The formula takes
    into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including
    asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk
    and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an
    early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately
    capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory
    action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These
    rules apply to each of the Holding Company’s domestic
    insurance subsidiaries. State insurance laws provide insurance
    regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take
    various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital
    does not exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most
    recent annual statutory financial statements filed with
    insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of
    these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those RBC levels.

Asset/Liability
    Management

The Company actively manages its assets using an approach that
    balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching,
    liquidity and investment return. The goals of the investment
    process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted
    investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring
    that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and
    duration basis. The asset/liability management process is the
    shared responsibility of the Portfolio Management Unit, the
    Financial Management and Oversight Asset/Liability



Management Unit, and the operating business segments under the
    supervision of the various product line specific Asset/Liability
    Management Committees (“ALM Committees”). The ALM
    Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving target
    portfolios on a periodic basis, establishing investment
    guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the
    asset/liability management process. The portfolio managers and
    asset sector specialists, who have responsibility on a
    day-to-day basis for risk management of their respective
    investing activities, implement the goals and objectives
    established by the ALM Committees.

The Company establishes target asset portfolios for each major
    insurance product, which represent the investment strategies
    used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels
    of risk. These strategies are monitored through regular review
    of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve
    sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration
    and credit quality. In executing these asset/liability matching
    strategies, management regularly reevaluates the estimates used
    in determining the approximate amounts and timing of payments to
    or on behalf of policyholders for insurance liabilities. Many of
    these estimates are inherently subjective and could impact the
    Company’s ability to achieve its asset/liability management
    goals and objectives.

Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate
    adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. The Company’s
    liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents and short-term
    investments, excluding securities lending) was
    $12.3 billion and $7.7 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Liquidity needs are determined from
    a rolling

12-month

forecast by portfolio and are monitored daily. Asset mix and
    maturities are adjusted based on forecast. Cash flow testing and
    stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity. The
    Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its
    cash needs under various scenarios that include the potential
    risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. The
    Company includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many
    of its products, including general account institutional pension
    products (generally group annuities, including GICs, and certain
    deposit fund liabilities) sold to employee benefit plan
    sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from
    making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product.

In the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements
    beyond normal liquidity, the Company has multiple alternatives
    available based on market conditions and the amount and timing
    of the liquidity need. These options include cash flows from
    operations, the sale of liquid assets, global funding sources
    and various credit facilities.

The Company’s ability to sell investment assets could be
    limited by accounting rules including rules relating to the
    intent and ability to hold impaired securities until the market
    value of those securities recovers.

In extreme circumstances, all general account assets within a
    statutory legal entity are available to fund any obligation of
    the general account within that legal entity.

A disruption in the financial markets could limit the Holding
    Company’s access to or cost of liquidity.

Liquidity
    Sources

Cash Flows from Operations.

The Company’s
    principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from
    insurance premiums, annuity considerations and deposit funds. A
    primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows is
    the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.

The Company’s principal cash inflows from its investment
    activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from
    maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income.
    The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash
    inflows are the risk of default by debtors and market
    volatilities. The Company closely monitors and manages these
    risks through its credit risk management process.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, and marketable fixed maturity and equity
    securities. Liquid assets exclude assets relating to securities
    lending activities. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company had $188.4 billion and $186.5 billion in
    liquid assets, respectively.

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of both short-term and long-term
    instruments, including repurchase agreements, commercial paper,
    medium- and long-term debt, junior



subordinated debt securities, shares subject to mandatory
    redemption, capital securities and stockholders’ equity.
    The diversity of the Company’s funding sources enhances
    funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one source of
    funds and generally lowers the cost of funds.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had outstanding
    $667 million and $1.4 billion in short-term debt,
    respectively, and at December 31, 2007 and 2006, had
    outstanding $9.6 billion and $9.1 billion in long-term
    debt, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company had outstanding $5.7 billion and $850 million
    in collateral financing arrangements, respectively. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had outstanding
    $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, in junior
    subordinated debt and $159 million and $278 million,
    respectively, in shares subject to mandatory redemption.

Debt Issuances.

In December 2007, MetLife
    Capital Trust IV (“Trust IV”), a variable
    interest entity (“VIE”)  consolidated by the Company,
    issued exchangeable surplus trust securities (the
    “Trust Securities”) with a face amount of
    $700 million and a discount of $6 million
    ($694 million). The Trust Securities will be exchanged
    into a like amount of Holding Company junior subordinated
    debentures on December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption
    date; mandatorily under certain circumstances; and at any time
    upon the Holding Company exercising its option to redeem the
    securities. The Trust Securities will be exchanged for
    junior subordinated debentures prior to repayment. The final
    maturity of the debentures is December 15, 2067. The
    Holding Company may cause the redemption of the
    Trust Securities or debentures (i) in whole or in
    part, at any time on or after December 15, 2032 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or
    in part, prior to December 15, 2032 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest on the
    Trust Securities or debentures is payable semi-annually at
    a fixed rate of 7.875% up to, but not including,
    December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption date. In the
    event the Trust Securities or debentures are not redeemed
    on or before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue
    at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 3.96%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    Trust Securities or debentures for a period up to ten
    years. Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If
    interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, the
    Holding Company may be required to use proceeds from the sale of
    its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy its
    obligation. In connection with the issuance of the
    Trust Securities, the Holding Company entered into a
    replacement capital covenant (“RCC”). As a part of the
    RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem,
    or purchase the debentures on or before December 15, 2057,
    unless, subject to certain limitations, it has received proceeds
    from the sale of specified capital securities. The RCC will
    terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including an
    acceleration of the debentures due to the occurrence of an event
    of default. The RCC is not intended for the benefit of holders
    of the debentures and may not be enforced by them. The RCC is
    for the benefit of holders of one or more other designated
    series of its indebtedness (which will initially be its
    5.70% senior notes due June 15, 2035). The Holding
    Company also entered into a replacement capital obligation which
    will commence in 2037 and under which the Holding Company must
    use reasonable commercial efforts to raise replacement capital
    through the issuance of certain qualifying capital securities.

In December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block
    liabilities to MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston
    (“MRC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In
    connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors
    placed by an unaffiliated financial institution,
    $2.5 billion of

35-year

surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the
    assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes
    accrues at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus 55 basis points, payable quarterly. The ability
    of MRC to make interest and principal payments on the surplus
    notes is contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval.
    Simultaneous with issuing the surplus notes, the Holding Company
    entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated financial
    institution, under which the Holding Company is entitled to the
    interest paid by MRC on the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 55 basis points in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 112 basis points, payable quarterly. Under this
    agreement, the Holding Company may also be required to make
    payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to
    any decline in the market value of the surplus notes and in
    connection with any early termination of this agreement. A
    majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus notes
    were placed in trust to support MRC’s statutory obligations
    associated with the assumed closed block liabilities. The trust
    is a VIE which is consolidated



by the Company. At December 31, 2007, the Company held
    assets in trust of $1.9 billion associated with the
    transaction.

In May 2007, the Holding Company and MetLife Reinsurance Company
    of South Carolina (“MRSC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of the Company, entered into a

30-year

collateral financing arrangement with an unaffiliated financial
    institution that provides up to $3.5 billion of statutory
    reserve support for MRSC associated with reinsurance obligations
    under intercompany reinsurance agreements. Such statutory
    reserves are associated with universal life secondary guarantees
    and are required under U.S. Valuation of Life Policies
    Model Regulation (commonly referred to as

Regulation A-XXX).

At December 31, 2007, $2.4 billion had been drawn upon
    under the collateral financing arrangement. The collateral
    financing arrangement may be extended by agreement of the
    Holding Company and the unaffiliated financial institution on
    each anniversary of the closing. Proceeds from the collateral
    financing arrangement were placed in trust to support
    MRSC’s statutory obligations associated with the
    reinsurance of secondary guarantees. The trust is a VIE which is
    consolidated by the Company. The unaffiliated financial
    institution is entitled to the return on the investment
    portfolio held by the trust. Simultaneous with entering into the
    collateral financing arrangement, the Holding Company entered
    into an agreement with the same unaffiliated financial
    institution under which the Holding Company is entitled to the
    return on the investment portfolio held by the trust established
    in connection with this collateral financing arrangement in
    exchange for the payment of a stated rate of return to the
    unaffiliated financial institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 70 basis points, payable quarterly. The Holding
    Company may also be required to make payments to the
    unaffiliated financial institution, for deposit into the trust,
    related to any decline in the market value of the assets held by
    the trust, as well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early
    termination of the collateral financing arrangement. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company held assets in trust of
    $2.3 billion associated with this transaction.

In March 2007, RGA issued $300 million of

10-year

senior notes with a fixed rate of 5.625%, payable semiannually.
    RGA used $50 million of the net proceeds of the offering to
    repay existing debt during the year ended December 31, 2007.

In December 2006, the Holding Company issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $1.25 billion. The
    debentures are scheduled for redemption on December 15,
    2036; the final maturity of the debentures is December 15,
    2066. The Holding Company may redeem the debentures (i) in
    whole or in part, at any time on or after December 15, 2031
    at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to
    the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances,
    in whole or in part, prior to December 15, 2031 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest is
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.40% up to, but not
    including, December 15, 2036, the scheduled redemption
    date. In the event the debentures are not redeemed on or before
    the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an annual
    rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.205%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for a period up to ten years. Interest compounds
    during such periods of deferral. If interest is deferred for
    more than five consecutive years, the Holding Company may be
    required to use proceeds from the sale of its common stock or
    warrants on common stock to satisfy its obligation. In
    connection with the issuance of the debentures, the Holding
    Company entered into a RCC. As part of the RCC, the Holding
    Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the
    debentures on or before December 15, 2056, unless, subject
    to certain limitations, it has received proceeds from the sale
    of specified capital securities. The RCC will terminate upon the
    occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration of the
    debentures due to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC
    is not intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and
    may not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of
    holders of one or more other designated series of its
    indebtedness (which will initially be its 5.70% senior
    notes due June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered
    into a replacement capital obligation which will commence in
    2036 and under which the Holding Company must use reasonable
    commercial efforts to raise replacement capital through the
    issuance of certain qualifying capital securities.

In June 2006, Timberlake Financial L.L.C., (“Timberlake
    Financial”), a subsidiary of RGA, completed an offering of
    $850 million of Series A Floating Rate Insured Notes
    due June 2036 in a private placement. Interest on the notes
    accrues at an annual rate of

1-month

LIBOR plus 29 basis points payable monthly. The payment of
    interest and principal on the notes is insured through a
    financial guaranty insurance policy with a third party. The
    notes represent senior, secured indebtedness of Timberlake
    Financial with no recourse to RGA or its other subsidiaries.



Up to $150 million of additional notes may be offered in
    the future. In order to make payments of principal and interest
    on the notes, Timberlake Financial will rely upon the receipt of
    interest and principal payments on surplus note and dividend
    payments from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Timberlake
    Reinsurance Company II (“Timberlake Re”), a South
    Carolina captive insurance company. The ability of Timberlake Re
    to make interest and principal payments on the surplus note and
    dividend payments to Timberlake Financial is contingent upon
    South Carolina regulatory approval and the performance of
    specified term life insurance policies with guaranteed level
    premiums retroceded by RGA’s subsidiary, RGA Reinsurance
    Company (“RGA Reinsurance”), to Timberlake Re.
    Proceeds from the offering of the notes, along with a
    $113 million direct investment by RGA, collateralize the
    notes and are not available to satisfy the general obligations
    of RGA or the Company. Most of these assets were placed in a
    trust and provide long-term collateral as support for statutory
    reserves required by U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model
    Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX) on term
    life insurance policies with guaranteed level premium periods
    reinsured by RGA Reinsurance. The trust is consolidated by
    Timberlake Re which in-turn is consolidated by Timberlake
    Financial. Timberlake Financial is considered to be a VIE and
    RGA is considered to be the primary beneficiary. As such, the
    results of Timberlake Financial have been consolidated by RGA
    and ultimately by the Company. At December 31, 2007, the
    Company held assets in trust of $899 million associated
    with the transaction. In addition the Company held
    $50 million in custody as of December 31, 2007.

MetLife Bank has entered into several repurchase agreements with
    the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLB of
    NY”) whereby MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements
    in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been
    granted a blanket lien on MetLife Bank’s residential
    mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to collateralize
    MetLife Bank’s obligations under the repurchase agreements.
    The repurchase agreements and the related security agreement
    represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of
    default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is
    limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the
    outstanding repurchase agreements. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, MetLife Bank received
    advances totaling $390 million, $260 million and
    $775 million, respectively, from the FHLB of NY, which were
    included in long-term debt. MetLife Bank also made repayments of
    $175 million, $117 million and $25 million to the
    FHLB of NY during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The amount of the Company’s
    liability for repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY was
    $1.2 billion and $998 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in long-term debt.

In December 2005, RGA issued junior subordinated debentures with
    a face amount of $400 million. Interest is payable
    semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.75% up to but not including
    the scheduled redemption date, December 15, 2015. The
    debentures may be redeemed (i) in whole or in part, at any
    time on or after December 15, 2015 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in whole or in part, prior to
    December 15, 2015 at their principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, a
    make-whole price. In the event the debentures are not redeemed
    on or before the scheduled redemption date of December 15,
    2015, interest on these debentures will accrue at an annual rate
    of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.665%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The final maturity of the debentures is
    December 15, 2065. RGA has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for a period up to ten years. Upon an optional or
    mandatory deferral of interest payments, RGA is generally not
    permitted to pay common stock dividends or make payments of
    interest or principal on securities which rank equal or junior
    to the subordinated debentures, until the accrued and unpaid
    interest on the subordinated debentures is paid. Interest
    compounds during periods of deferral.

In June 2005, the Company issued, in connection with the common
    equity units more fully described in “— Liquidity
    and Capital Resources — The Holding
    Company — Liquidity Sources — Common Equity
    Units”, $1,067 million 4.82% Series A and
    $1,067 million 4.91% Series B junior subordinated
    debentures due no later than February 15, 2039 and
    February 15, 2040, respectively, for a total of
    $2,134 million.

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued 400 million pounds
    sterling ($729.2 million at issuance) aggregate principal
    amount of 5.25% senior notes due June 29, 2020 at a
    discount of 4.5 million pounds sterling ($8.1 million
    at issuance), for aggregate proceeds of 395.5 million
    pounds sterling ($721.1 million at issuance). The senior
    notes were initially offered and sold outside the United States
    in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).



In June 2005, the Holding Company issued $1.0 billion
    aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due
    June 15, 2015 at a discount of $2.7 million
    ($997.3 million), and $1.0 billion aggregate principal
    amount of 5.70% senior notes due June 15, 2035 at a
    discount of $2.4 million ($997.6 million).

    unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect the
    Company’s actual future cash funding requirements.

Separate account liabilities are excluded from the table above.
    Separate account liabilities represent the fair market value of
    the funds that are separately administered by the Company.
    Generally, the separate account owner, rather than the Company,
    bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account
    liabilities are legally segregated and are not subject to the
    claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. Net
    deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized
    capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not
    reflected in the consolidated statements of income. The separate
    account liabilities will be fully funded by cash flows from the
    separate account assets.

The Company also enters into agreements to purchase goods and
    services in the normal course of business; however, these
    purchase obligations are not material to its consolidated
    results of operations or financial position as of
    December 31, 2007.

Additionally, the Company has agreements in place for services
    it conducts, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to
    insurance, reinsurance, loans, and capitalization. Intercompany
    transactions have appropriately been eliminated in
    consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance
    subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the
    appropriate departments of insurance as required.

Support Agreements.

The Holding Company and
    several of its subsidiaries (each, an “Obligor”) are
    parties to various capital support commitments, guarantees and
    contingent reinsurance agreements with certain subsidiaries of
    the Holding Company and a corporation in which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under these arrangements, each
    Obligor, with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to
    cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels,
    has guaranteed certain contractual obligations or has agreed to
    provide, upon the occurrence of certain contingencies,
    reinsurance for such entity’s insurance liabilities or for
    certain policies reinsured by such entity. Management does not
    anticipate that these arrangements will place any significant
    demands upon the Company’s liquidity resources.

Litigation.

Putative or certified class action
    litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments
    against the Company, in addition to those discussed elsewhere
    herein and those otherwise provided for in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of
    the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, in
    connection with its activities as an insurer, employer,
    investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state
    insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state
    authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations
    concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable
    insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome
    of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses except as noted elsewhere
    herein in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to herein, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcome of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Other.

Based on management’s analysis of
    its expected cash inflows from operating activities, the
    dividends it receives from subsidiaries, including MLIC, that
    are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory
    approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other
    anticipated cash flows, management believes there will be
    sufficient liquidity to enable the Company to make payments on
    debt, make cash dividend payments on its common and preferred
    stock, pay all operating expenses, and meet its cash needs. The
    nature of the Company’s diverse product portfolio and
    customer base lessens the likelihood that normal operations will
    result in any significant strain on liquidity.

Consolidated Cash Flows.

Net cash provided by
    operating activities increased by $3.4 billion to
    $10.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 as
    compared to $6.6 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher net investment
    income and premiums, fees and other revenues.



Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by
    $1.4 billion to $6.6 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $8.0 billion for the
    comparable 2005 period. The decrease in operating cash flows was
    primarily due to reinsurance receivables related to the sale of
    certain small market recordkeeping businesses. Partially
    offsetting the decrease was an increase in operating cash flows
    in 2006 over the comparable 2005 period primarily attributable
    to the acquisition of Travelers.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.9 billion
    and $15.4 billion for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities decreased by $11.5 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year.
    Net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily as
    a result of a decrease of $13.0 billion in the amount of
    securities lending cash collateral received in connection with
    the Company’s securities lending program and other cash
    collateral, $1.2 billion of an increase in shares acquired
    under the Company’s common stock repurchase program, a
    decrease in short-term debt borrowings of $0.8 billion and
    a decrease of $0.6 billion in net cash provided by
    policyholder account balances. In addition, net cash provided by
    financing activities was $0.5 billion lower than the
    comparable 2006 period due to the issuance of $0.7 billion
    of junior subordinated debt securities in 2007 as compared to
    $1.2 billion issued in 2006. These decreases were partially
    offset by an increase in the issuance of collateral financing
    arrangements of $4.0 billion and an increase in net
    issuances versus net repayments of long-term debt of
    $0.9 billion.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $15.4 billion
    and $14.5 billion for the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities increased by $0.9 billion primarily as
    a result of an increase of $7.2 billion in the amount of
    securities lending cash collateral received in connection with
    the securities lending program, a decrease in long-term debt
    repayments of $0.7 billion, an increase in the issuance of
    collateral financing arrangements of $0.9 billion and an
    increase in short-term debt borrowings of $0.1 billion.
    Such increases were offset by decreases in financing cash flows
    resulting from a decrease in issuance of preferred stock, junior
    subordinated debt securities, and long-term debt aggregating
    $6.6 billion which were principally used to finance the
    acquisition of Travelers in 2005, combined with a decrease of
    $0.9 billion associated with a decrease in net policyholder
    account balance deposits and an increase of $0.5 billion of
    shares acquired under the Company’s common stock repurchase
    program which was resumed in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Net cash used in investing activities was $10.6 billion and
    $18.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Accordingly, net cash used in investing
    activities decreased by $8.3 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to prior year. In the current
    year, cash available for the purchase of invested assets
    decreased by $11.5 billion as a result of the reduction in
    cash provided by financing activities discussed above. Also,
    partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of
    $3.4 billion in net cash provided by operating activities
    discussed above. The lower amount of cash available for
    investing activities resulted in a decrease in net purchases of
    fixed maturity securities of $15.9 billion, other invested
    assets of $1.4 billion, and a decrease in net origination
    of mortgage and consumer loans of $0.6 billion. This was
    partially offset by increases in the net purchases of real
    estate and real estate joint ventures of $6.3 billion,
    equity securities of $1.4 billion and other limited
    partnership interests of $0.8 billion. Also, there was a
    decrease in cash provided by short-term investments of
    $0.5 billion. In addition, the 2007 period includes the
    sale of MetLife Australia’s annuities and pension
    businesses and the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in
    MetLife Fubon of $0.7 billion, while the 2006 period
    includes additional consideration paid related to purchases of
    businesses $0.1 billion.

Net cash used in investing activities was $18.9 billion and
    $22.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Accordingly, net cash used in investing
    activities decreased by $3.7 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to prior year. Net cash used
    in investing activities in the prior year included cash used to
    acquire Travelers of $11.0 billion, less cash acquired of
    $0.9 billion for a net total cash paid of
    $10.1 billion, which was funded by $6.8 billion in
    securities issuances and $4.2 billion of cash provided by
    operations and the sale of invested assets. During the current
    year, cash available for investment as a result of cash
    collateral received in connection with the securities lending
    program increased by $7.2 billion. Cash available from
    operations and available for investment decreased by
    $1.4 billion. Cash available for the purchase of invested
    assets increased by $4.3 billion as a result of the
    increase in securities lending activities of $7.2 billion
    as well as a decrease in the cash required for acquisitions of
    $4.2 billion, offset by the decrease in issuance of
    preferred stock, junior subordinated debt securities, and
    long-term debt aggregating $6.6 billion as well as the
    decrease in cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion. Cash
    available for investing activities was used to increase
    purchases of fixed maturity



securities, other invested assets, and short-term investments,
    as well as increase the origination of mortgage and consumer
    loans and decrease net sales of real estate and real estate
    joint ventures and equity securities.

Capital

Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies and
    Financial Holding Companies —
    Capital.

The Holding Company and its insured
    depository institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank, are subject to
    risk-based and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal
    banking regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding
    companies. The federal banking regulatory agencies are required
    by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect
    to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. As
    of their most recently filed reports with the federal banking
    regulatory agencies, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank met the
    minimum capital standards as per federal banking regulatory
    agencies with all of MetLife Bank’s risk-based and leverage
    capital ratios meeting the federal banking regulatory
    agencies’ “well capitalized” standards and all of
    MetLife, Inc.’s risk-based and leverage capital ratios
    meeting the “adequately capitalized” standards.

Liquidity

Liquidity is managed to preserve stable, reliable and
    cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future
    financial obligations and is provided by a variety of sources,
    including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of
    short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale
    financial markets and the ability to borrow through committed
    credit facilities. The Holding Company is an active participant
    in the global financial markets through which it obtains a
    significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as
    cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of the
    Holding Company’s liquidity management. Decisions to access
    these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views
    of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile. A
    disruption in the financial markets could limit the Holding
    Company’s access to liquidity.

The Holding Company’s ability to maintain regular access to
    competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current
    high credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies.
    Management views its capital ratios, credit quality, stable and
    diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and its
    liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining high
    credit ratings.



Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity
    risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid
    asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow
    obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and
    debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on the
    Holding Company’s liquidity.

Liquidity
    Sources

Dividends.

The primary source of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity is dividends it receives from its
    insurance subsidiaries. The Holding Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the
    payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their
    respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries is based on the surplus to
    policyholders as of the immediately preceding calendar year and
    statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding
    calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by
    insurance regulators of various states in which the Company
    conducts business, differ in certain respects from accounting
    principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity
    with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment
    of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment
    reserves, reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus
    notes. Management of the Holding Company cannot provide
    assurances that the Holding Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries will have statutory earnings to support payment of
    dividends to the Holding Company in an amount sufficient to fund
    its cash requirements and pay cash dividends and that the
    applicable insurance departments will not disapprove any
    dividends that such insurance subsidiaries must submit for
    approval.

The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by
    the respective insurance subsidiary without insurance regulatory
    approval and the respective dividends paid:

For the year ended December 31, 2007, $190 million in
    dividends from other subsidiaries were paid, of which
    $176 million were returns of capital, to the Holding
    Company. MetLife Mexico S.A. paid $116 million in dividends
    to the Holding Company for the year ended December 31,
    2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, there were
    returns of capital of $154 million to the Holding Company
    from other subsidiaries.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and marketable fixed maturity securities.
    Liquid assets exclude assets relating to securities lending
    activities. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Holding
    Company had $2.3 billion and $3.9 billion in liquid
    assets, respectively.

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of both short-term and long-term
    instruments, commercial paper, medium- and long-term debt,
    junior subordinated debt securities, collateral financing
    arrangements, capital securities and stockholders’ equity.
    The diversity of the Holding Company’s funding sources
    enhances funding flexibility and limits dependence on any one
    source of funds and generally lowers



the cost of funds. Other sources of the Holding Company’s
    liquidity include programs for short- and long-term borrowing,
    as needed.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Holding Company had
    $310 million and $616 million in short-term debt
    outstanding, respectively. At both December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Holding Company had $7.0 billion of unaffiliated
    long-term debt outstanding. At both December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Holding Company had $500 million of affiliated
    long-term debt outstanding. At both December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Holding Company had $3.4 billion of junior
    subordinated debt securities outstanding. At December 31,
    2007, the Holding Company had $2.4 billion in collateral
    financing arrangements outstanding. The Holding Company did not
    have any collateral financing arrangements outstanding at
    December 31, 2006.

In November 2007, the Holding Company filed a shelf registration
    statement (the “2007 Registration Statement”) with the
    SEC, which was automatically effective upon filing, in
    accordance with SEC rules which also allow for pay-as-you-go
    fees and the ability to add securities by filing automatically
    effective amendment for companies, such as the Holding Company,
    which qualify as “Well-Known Seasoned Issuers.” The
    2007 Registration Statement registered an unlimited amount of
    debt and equity securities and supersedes the shelf registration
    statement that the Holding Company filed in April 2005. The
    terms of any offering will be established at the time of the
    offering.

Debt Issuances.

As described more fully in
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity Sources — Debt
    Issuances”, during December 2007, Trust IV issued
    Trust Securities with a face amount of $700 million
    and a discount of $6 million ($694 million) and a
    fixed rate of interest of 7.875% up to, but not including,
    December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption date. The
    beneficial interest of Trust IV held by the Holding Company
    is not represented by an investment in Trust IV but rather
    by a financing agreement between the Holding Company and
    Trust IV. The assets of Trust IV are $700 million
    of 7.375% surplus notes of MLIC, which are scheduled to mature
    December 15, 2037, and rights under the financing
    agreement. Under the financing agreement, the Holding Company
    has the obligation to make payments (i) semiannually at a
    fixed rate of 0.50% of the surplus notes outstanding and owned
    by Trust IV or if greater (ii) equal to the difference
    between the Trust Securities interest payment and the
    interest received by Trust IV on the surplus notes. The
    ability of MLIC to make interest and principal payments on the
    surplus notes to the Holding Company is contingent upon
    regulatory approval. The Trust Securities, will be
    exchanged into a like amount of Holding Company junior
    subordinated debentures on December 15, 2037, the scheduled
    redemption date; mandatorily under certain circumstances; and at
    any time upon the Holding Company exercising its option to
    redeem the securities. The Trust Securities will be
    exchanged for junior subordinated debentures prior to repayment
    and the Holding Company is ultimately responsible for repayment
    of the junior subordinated debentures. The Holding
    Company’s other rights and obligations as it relates to the
    deferral of interest, redemption, replacement capital obligation
    and replacement capital covenant associated with the issuance of
    the Trust Securities are more fully described in
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity Sources — Debt
    Issuances.”

As described more fully in “— Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity
    Sources — Debt Issuances”:

•

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRC’s
    reinsurance of the closed block liabilities, entered into an
    agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under which
    the Holding Company is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on
    the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 55 basis points in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 112 basis points, payable quarterly. Under this
    agreement, the Holding Company may also be required to make
    payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to
    any decline in the market value of the surplus notes and in
    connection with any early termination of this agreement. The
    Holding Company’s net cost of 57 basis points has been
    allocated to MRC. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    this amount was immaterial.

•

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC’s
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, entered into
    an agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under
    which the Holding Company is entitled to the return on the
    investment portfolio held by the trust established in connection
    with this collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the
    payment of a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial
    institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 70 basis



points, payable quarterly. The Holding Company may also be
    required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution, for deposit into the trust, related to any decline
    in the market value of the assets held by the trust, as well as
    amounts outstanding upon maturity or early termination of the
    collateral financing arrangement. As a result of this agreement,
    the Holding Company effectively assumed the $2.4 billion
    liability under the collateral financing arrangement along with
    a beneficial interest in the trust holding the associated
    assets. The Holding Company simultaneously contributed to MRSC
    its beneficial interest in the trust, along with any return to
    be received on the investment portfolio held by the trust. The
    Holding Company allocates the financing costs associated with
    the collateral financing arrangement to MRSC.

In December 2006, the Holding Company issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $1.25 billion. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity Sources — Debt
    Issuances” for further information.

In September 2006, the Holding Company issued $204 million
    of affiliated long-term debt with an interest rate of 6.07%
    maturing in 2016.

In March 2006, the Holding Company issued $10 million of
    affiliated long-term debt with an interest rate of 5.70%
    maturing in 2016.

In December 2005, the Holding Company issued $286 million
    of affiliated long-term debt with an interest rate of 5.24%
    maturing in 2015.

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued $1.0 billion
    aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due
    June 15, 2015 at a discount of $2.7 million
    ($997.3 million), and $1.0 billion aggregate principal
    amount of 5.70% senior notes due June 15, 2035 at a
    discount of $2.4 million ($997.6 million).

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued 400 million pounds
    sterling ($729.2 million at issuance) aggregate principal
    amount of 5.25% senior notes due June 29, 2020 at a
    discount of 4.5 million pounds sterling ($8.1 million
    at issuance), for aggregate proceeds of 395.5 million
    pounds sterling ($721.1 million at issuance). These notes
    were initially offered and sold outside the United States in
    reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Preferred Stock.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Holding Company issued no new
    preferred stock.



In June 2005, the Holding Company issued 24 million shares
    of Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A
    (the “Series A preferred shares”) with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $600 million.

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued 60 million shares
    of 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the
    “Series B preferred shares,” together with the
    Series A preferred shares, collectively, the
    “Preferred Shares”) with a $0.01 par value per
    share, and a liquidation preference of $25 per share for
    aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion.

The Preferred Shares rank senior to the common stock with
    respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Dividends on the
    Preferred Shares are not cumulative. Holders of the Preferred
    Shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments only when,
    as and if declared by the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors or a duly authorized committee of the board. If
    dividends are declared on the Series A preferred shares,
    they will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual rate of
    the greater of: (i) 1.00% above

3-month

LIBOR on the related LIBOR determination date; or
    (ii) 4.00%. Any dividends declared on the Series B
    preferred shares will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an
    annual fixed rate of 6.50%. Accordingly, in the event that
    dividends are not declared on the Preferred Shares for payment
    on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to
    accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the
    dividend payment date, the Holding Company has no obligation to
    pay dividends accrued for that dividend period whether or not
    dividends are declared and paid in future periods. No dividends
    may, however, be paid or declared on the Holding Company’s
    common stock — or any other securities ranking junior
    to the Preferred Shares — unless the full dividends
    for the latest completed dividend period on all Preferred
    Shares, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or
    provided for.

The Holding Company is prohibited from declaring dividends on
    the Preferred Shares if it fails to meet specified capital
    adequacy, net income and shareholders’ equity levels. In
    addition, under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Holding
    Company may not be able to pay dividends if it does not earn
    sufficient operating income.

The Preferred Shares do not have voting rights except in certain
    circumstances where the dividends have not been paid for an
    equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or
    not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the
    holders of the Preferred Shares have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company.

The Preferred Shares are not subject to any mandatory
    redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or
    similar provisions. The Preferred Shares are redeemable, but not
    prior to September 15, 2010. On and after that date,
    subject to regulatory approval, the Preferred Shares will be
    redeemable at the Holding Company’s option in whole or in
    part, at a redemption price of $25 per Preferred Share, plus
    declared and unpaid dividends.

See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    Uses — Dividends” for dividends paid on the
    Company’s preferred stock.

Common Equity Units.

In connection with
    financing the acquisition of Travelers on July 1, 2005, the
    Holding Company distributed and sold 82.8 million 6.375%
    common equity units for $2,070 million in proceeds in a
    registered public offering on June 21, 2005.

Each common equity unit has an initial stated amount of $25 per
    unit and consists of:

•

a 1/80, or 1.25% ($12.50), undivided beneficial ownership
    interest in a series A trust preferred security of MetLife
    Capital Trust II (“Series A Trust”), with an
    initial liquidation amount of $1,000.

•

a 1/80, or 1.25% ($12.50), undivided beneficial ownership
    interest in a series B trust preferred security of MetLife
    Capital Trust III (“Series B Trust” and,
    together with the Series A Trust, the “Capital
    Trusts”), with an initial liquidation amount of $1,000.

•

a stock purchase contract under which the holder of the common
    equity unit will purchase and the Holding Company will sell, on
    each of the initial stock purchase date and the subsequent stock
    purchase date, a variable number of shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for a
    purchase price of $12.50.



The Holding Company issued $1,067 million 4.82%
    Series A and $1,067 million 4.91% Series B junior
    subordinated debt securities due no later than February 15,
    2039 and February 15, 2040, respectively, for a total of
    $2,134 million, in exchange for $2,070 million in
    aggregate proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred
    securities by the Capital Trusts and $64 million in trust
    common securities issued equally by the Capital Trusts. The
    common and preferred securities of the Capital Trusts, totaling
    $2,134 million, represent undivided beneficial ownership
    interests in the assets of the Capital Trusts, have no stated
    maturity and must be redeemed upon maturity of the corresponding
    series of junior subordinated debt securities — the
    sole assets of the respective Capital Trusts. The Series A
    Trust and Series B Trust will each make quarterly
    distributions on the common and preferred securities at an
    annual rate of 4.82% and 4.91%, respectively.

The Holding Company has directly guaranteed the repayment of the
    trust preferred securities to the holders thereof to the extent
    that there are funds available in the Capital Trusts. The
    guarantee will remain in place until the full redemption of the
    trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities held
    by the common equity unit holders are pledged to the Holding
    Company to collateralize the obligation of the common equity
    unit holders under the related stock purchase contracts. The
    common equity unit holder may substitute certain zero coupon
    treasury securities in place of the trust preferred securities
    as collateral under the stock purchase contract.

The trust preferred securities have remarketing dates which
    correspond with the initial and subsequent stock purchase dates
    to provide the holders of the common equity units with the
    proceeds to exercise the stock purchase contracts. The initial
    stock purchase date is expected to be August 15, 2008, but
    could be deferred for quarterly periods until February 15,
    2009, and the subsequent stock purchase date is expected to be
    February 15, 2009, but could be deferred for quarterly
    periods until February 15, 2010. At the remarketing date,
    the remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the
    interest rate on the trust preferred securities to generate
    sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the common equity
    unit holder’s obligation under the stock purchase contract,
    subject to a reset cap for each of the first two attempted
    remarketings of each series. The interest rate on the supporting
    junior subordinated debt securities issued by the Holding
    Company will be reset at a commensurate rate. If the initial
    remarketing is unsuccessful, the remarketing agent will attempt
    to remarket the trust preferred securities, as necessary, in
    subsequent quarters through February 15, 2009 for the
    Series A trust preferred securities and through
    February 15, 2010 for the Series B trust preferred
    securities. The final attempt at remarketing will not be subject
    to the reset cap. If all remarketing attempts are unsuccessful,
    the Holding Company has the right, as a secured party, to apply
    the liquidation amount on the trust preferred securities to the
    common equity unit holders obligation under the stock purchase
    contract and to deliver to the common equity unit holder a
    junior subordinated debt security payable on August 15,
    2010 at an annual rate of 4.82% and 4.91% on the Series A
    and Series B trust preferred securities, respectively, in
    payment of any accrued and unpaid distributions.

Each stock purchase contract requires (i) the Holding
    Company to pay the holder of the common equity unit quarterly
    contract payments on the stock purchase contracts at the annual
    rate of 1.510% on the stated amount of $25 per stock purchase
    contract until the initial stock purchase date and at the annual
    rate of 1.465% on the remaining stated amount of $12.50 per
    stock purchase contract thereafter; and (ii) the holder of
    the common equity unit to purchase, and the Holding Company to
    sell, for $12.50, on each of the initial stock purchase date and
    the subsequent stock purchase date, a number of newly issued or
    treasury shares of the Holding Company’s common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, equal to the applicable settlement rate.
    The settlement rate at the respective stock purchase date will
    be calculated based on the closing price of the common stock
    during a specified

20-day

period immediately preceding the applicable stock purchase date.
    Accordingly, upon settlement in the aggregate, the Holding
    Company will receive proceeds of $2,070 million and issue
    between 39.0 million and 47.8 million shares of its
    common stock. The stock purchase contract may be exercised at
    the option of the holder at any time prior to the settlement
    date. However, upon early settlement, the holder will receive
    the minimum settlement rate.

Credit Facilities.

In June 2007, the Holding
    Company and MetLife Funding entered into a $3.0 billion
    credit agreement with various financial institutions, the
    proceeds of which are available to be used for general corporate
    purposes, to support their commercial paper programs and for the
    issuance of letters of credit. All borrowings under the credit
    agreement must be repaid by June 2012, except that letters of
    credit outstanding upon termination may remain outstanding until
    June 2013. The borrowers and the lenders under this facility may
    agree to extend the term of all or part of the facility to no
    later than June 2014, except that letters of credit outstanding
    upon termination may remain outstanding until June 2015. The
    $1.5 billion credit agreement, with an April 2009
    expiration, and the



$1.5 billion credit agreement, with an April 2010
    expiration, were both terminated in June 2007 and replaced by
    the aforementioned facility.

At December 31, 2007, $1.5 billion of letters of
    credit have been issued under these unsecured credit facilities
    on behalf of the Holding Company.

Letters of Credit.

At December 31, 2007,
    the Holding Company had $1.5 billion in outstanding letters
    of credit, all of which are associated with the aforementioned
    credit facilities, from various financial institutions. As

    arrangements may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily
    reflect the Holding Company’s actual future cash funding
    requirements.

    earnings, expected medium- and long-term earnings, financial
    condition, regulatory capital position, and applicable
    governmental regulations and policies. Furthermore, the payment
    of dividends and other distributions to the Holding Company by

Affiliated Capital Transactions.

During the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Holding Company
    invested an aggregate of $2.8 billion and
    $1.8 billion, respectively, in various affiliates.

In December 2005, RGA repurchased 1.6 million shares of its
    outstanding common stock at an aggregate price of
    $76 million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement
    with a major bank. The bank borrowed the stock sold to RGA from
    third parties and purchased the shares in the open market over
    the subsequent few months to return to the lenders. RGA would
    either pay or receive an amount based on the actual amount paid
    by the bank to purchase the shares. These repurchases resulted
    in an increase in the Company’s ownership percentage of RGA
    to approximately 53% at December 31, 2005 from
    approximately 52% at December 31, 2004. In February 2006,
    the final purchase price was determined, resulting in a cash
    settlement substantially equal to the aggregate cost. RGA
    recorded the initial repurchase of shares as treasury stock and
    recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the cost of the
    treasury stock. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s
    ownership was approximately 52% of RGA.



The Holding Company lends funds, as necessary, to its
    affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital
    requirements. Such loans are included in loans to affiliates and

Debt Repayments.

The Holding Company repaid a

    December 2006 and a $1,006 million 3.911% senior note
    which matured in May 2005.

Share Repurchase.

In October 2004, the Holding
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion
    common stock repurchase program. In February 2007, the Holding
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional
    $1 billion common stock repurchase program. In September
    2007, the Holding Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase program
    which began after the completion of the $1 billion common
    stock repurchase program authorized in February 2007. In January
    2008, the Holding Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase program,
    which began after the completion of the September 2007 program.
    (See “— Subsequent Events”). Under these
    authorizations, the Holding Company may purchase its common
    stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market
    (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading plan
    meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act and in privately negotiated transactions.

The Holding Company has entered into the following accelerated
    common stock repurchase agreements:

•

In December 2007, the Holding Company entered into an
    accelerated common stock repurchase agreement with a major bank.
    Under the terms of the agreement, the Holding Company paid the
    bank $450 million in cash in January 2008 in exchange for
    6.6 million shares of its outstanding common stock that the
    bank borrowed from third parties. Also, in January 2008, the
    bank delivered 1.1 million additional shares of Holding
    Company’s common stock to the Holding Company resulting in
    a total of 7.7 million shares being repurchased under the
    agreement. At December 31, 2007, the Holding Company
    recorded the obligation to pay $450 million to the bank as
    a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Upon settlement with
    the bank, the Holding Company increased additional paid-in
    capital and reduced treasury stock.

•

In November 2007, the Holding Company repurchased
    11.6 million shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    initial cost of $750 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties and
    purchased the common stock in the open market to return to such
    third parties. Also, in November 2007, the Holding Company
    received a cash adjustment of $19 million based on the
    trading price of the common stock during the repurchase period,
    for a final purchase price of $731 million. The Holding
    Company recorded the shares initially repurchased as treasury
    stock and recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the
    cost of the treasury stock.

•

In March 2007, the Holding Company repurchased 11.9 million
    shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of
    $750 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the common stock
    sold to the Holding Company from third parties and purchased
    common stock in the open market to return to such third parties.
    In June 2007, the Holding Company paid a cash adjustment of
    $17 million for a final purchase price of
    $767 million. The Holding Company recorded the shares
    initially repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount
    paid as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.



•

In December 2006, the Holding Company repurchased
    4.0 million shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $232 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the common stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties
    and purchased the common stock in the open market to return to
    such third parties. In February 2007, the Holding Company paid a
    cash adjustment of $8 million for a final purchase price of
    $240 million. The Holding Company recorded the shares
    initially repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount
    paid as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

•

In December 2004, the Holding Company repurchased
    7.3 million shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $300 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties and
    purchased the common stock in the open market to return to such
    third parties. In April 2005, the Holding Company received a
    cash adjustment of $7 million based on the actual amount
    paid by the bank to purchase the common stock, for a final
    purchase price of $293 million. The Holding Company
    recorded the shares initially repurchased as treasury stock and
    recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the cost of the
    treasury stock.

The Company also repurchased 3.1 million and
    4.6 million shares through open market purchases for
    $200 million and $268 million, respectively, during
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Cumulatively, the Company repurchased 26.6 million and
    8.6 million shares of its common stock for
    $1.7 billion and $500 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company did
    not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the year
    ended December 31, 2005. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, 3.9 million,
    3.1 million and 25.0 million shares of common stock
    were issued from treasury stock for $172 million,
    $102 million and $819 million, respectively, of which
    22.4 million shares with a market value of $1 billion
    were issued in connection with the acquisition of Travelers of
    July 1, 2005.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $216 million
    remaining on the October 2004 common stock repurchase program
    which was subsequently reduced by $8 million to
    $208 million after the February 2007 cash adjustment to the
    December 2006 accelerated common stock repurchase agreement. The
    February 2007 stock repurchase program authorization was fully
    utilized during 2007. At December 31, 2007,
    $511 million remained on the Company’s September 2007
    common stock repurchase program. The $511 million remaining
    on the September 2007 common stock repurchase program was
    reduced by $450 million to $61 million upon settlement
    of the accelerated stock repurchase agreement executed during
    December 2007 but for which no settlement occurred until January
    2008. Subsequent to the January 2008 authorization, the amount
    remaining under these repurchase programs was
    $1,061 million. After execution of the accelerated stock
    repurchase agreement in February 2008 and certain open market
    purchases as more fully described in
    “— Subsequent Events”, the Company’s
    remaining authorization is $261 million.

Future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon several
    factors, including the Company’s capital position, its
    financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions
    and the price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock.

See “—  Subsequent Events” for further
    information relating to common stock repurchases subsequent to
    December 31, 2007.

Support Agreements.

The Holding Company is
    party to various capital support commitments with certain of its
    subsidiaries and a corporation in which it owns 50% of the
    equity. Under these arrangements, the Holding Company has agreed
    to cause each such entity to meet specified capital and surplus
    levels. Management does not anticipate that these arrangements
    will place any significant demands upon the Holding
    Company’s liquidity resources.

Based on management’s analysis and comparison of its
    current and future cash inflows from the dividends it receives
    from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior
    insurance regulatory approval, its portfolio of liquid assets,
    anticipated securities issuances and other anticipated cash
    flows, management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to
    enable the Holding Company to make payments on debt, make cash
    dividend payments on its common and preferred stock, contribute
    capital to its subsidiaries, pay all operating expenses and meet
    its cash needs.



Subsequent
    Events

Dividends

On February 19, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    announced dividends of $0.3785745 per share, for a total of
    $9 million, on its Series A preferred shares, and
    $0.4062500 per share, for a total of $24 million, on its
    Series B preferred shares, subject to the final
    confirmation that it has met the financial tests specified in
    the Series A and Series B preferred shares, which the
    Company anticipates will be made on or about March 5, 2008,
    the earliest date permitted in accordance with the terms of the
    securities. Both dividends will be payable March 17, 2008
    to shareholders of record as of February 29, 2008.

Acquisitions

On February 1, 2008, the Company announced its completion
    of the acquisition of SafeGuard Health Enterprises, Inc.
    (“Safeguard”) for approximately $190 million.
    Safeguard is primarily involved in providing dental and vision
    benefit plans, including health maintenance and preferred
    provider organization plan designs and administrative services.

On January 2, 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of
    AFORE Actinver, S.A. de C.V. (“Actinver”) for
    approximately $125 million. Actinver manages retirement accounts
    for approximately 1.1 million individuals in Mexico.

Stock
    Repurchases

On January 15, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized a $1 billion common stock repurchase program,
    which began after the completion of an earlier $1 billion
    authorization that was announced in September 2007.

As previously described, in December 2007, the Company entered
    into an accelerated common stock repurchase agreement with a
    major bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid
    the bank $450 million in cash in January 2008 in exchange
    for 6.6 million shares of the Company’s outstanding
    common stock that the bank borrowed from third parties. Also, in
    January 2008, the bank delivered 1.1 million additional
    shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company
    resulting in a total of 7.7 million shares being
    repurchased under the agreement. Upon settlement with the bank,
    the Company increased additional paid-in capital and reduced
    treasury stock.

In February 2008, the Company entered into an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. Under the
    agreement, the Company paid the bank $711 million in cash and
    the bank delivered an initial amount of 11.2 million shares of
    the Company’s outstanding common stock that the bank
    borrowed from third parties. Final settlement of the agreement
    is scheduled to take place during the first half of 2008. The
    final number of shares the Company is repurchasing under the
    terms of the agreement and the timing of the final settlement
    will depend on, among other things, prevailing market conditions
    and the market prices of the common stock during the repurchase
    period. The Company recorded the consideration paid as a
    reduction to stockholders’ equity.

From January 1, 2008 to February 25, 2008, the Company
    also repurchased 1.6 million of its shares through open market
    purchases for $89 million.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. The
    amounts of these unfunded commitments were $5.3 billion and
    $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company anticipates that these amounts will be
    invested in partnerships over the next five years. There are no
    other obligations or liabilities arising from such arrangements
    that are reasonably likely to become material.



Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan
    commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $4.0 billion at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. The
    purpose of these loans is to enhance the Company’s total
    return on its investment portfolio. There are no other
    obligations or liabilities arising from such arrangements that
    are reasonably likely to become material.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts
    of these unfunded commitments were $1.2 billion and
    $1.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The purpose of these commitments and any related
    fundings is to enhance the Company’s total return on its
    investment portfolio. There are no other obligations or
    liabilities arising from such arrangements that are reasonably
    likely to become material.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and
    sublease agreements for office space, data processing and other
    equipment. The Company’s commitments under such lease
    agreements are included within the contractual obligations
    table. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Liquidity
    Uses — Investment and Other.”

Credit
    Facilities and Letters of Credit

The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities
    and letters of credit with various financial institutions. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity Sources — Credit
    Facilities” and “— Letters of Credit”
    for further descriptions of such arrangements.

Share-Based
    Arrangements

In connection with the issuance of common equity units, the
    Holding Company issued forward stock purchase contracts under
    which the Holding Company will issue, in 2008 and 2009, between
    39.0 and 47.8 million shares of its common stock, depending
    upon whether the share price is greater than $43.35 and less
    than $53.10. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    Sources — Common Equity Units.”

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as
    third party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to
    time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $800 million, with a cumulative maximum
    of $2.3 billion, while in other cases such limitations are
    not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations
    are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe
    that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    that could become due under these guarantees in the future.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the



Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the
    maximum potential amount that could become due under these
    indemnities in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded a $1 million liability with respect to a guarantee
    previously provided to MLII, a former subsidiary. The
    Company’s recorded liabilities at December 31, 2007
    and 2006 for indemnities, guarantees and commitments were
    $6 million and $5 million, respectively.

In connection with synthetically created investment
    transactions, the Company writes credit default swap obligations
    that generally require payment of principal outstanding due in
    exchange for the referenced credit obligation. If a credit
    event, as defined by the contract, occurs the Company’s
    maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of the referenced
    credits becomes worthless, was $1.7 billion at
    December 31, 2007. The credit default swaps expire at
    various times during the next ten years.

Other
    Commitments

    default by MICC, the FHLB of Boston’s recovery on the
    collateral is limited to the amount of MICC’s liability to
    the FHLB of Boston. The amount of the Company’s liability
    for funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston was
    $726 million and $926 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in policyholder
    account balances. The advances on these funding agreements are
    collateralized by residential mortgage-backed securities with
    fair values of $901 million and $1.1 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

MLIC is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds $339 million
    and $136 million of common stock of the FHLB of NY at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included

    agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby MLIC has issued such
    funding agreements in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB
    of NY has been granted a lien on certain MLIC assets, including
    residential mortgage-backed securities to collateralize
    MLIC’s obligations under the funding agreements. MLIC
    maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use,
    commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral
    as long as there is no event of default and the remaining
    qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral
    maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MLIC, the FHLB
    of NY’s recovery on the collateral is limited to the amount
    of MLIC’s liability to the FHLB of NY. The amount of the
    Company’s liability for funding agreements with the FHLB of
    NY was $4.6 billion at December 31, 2007, which is
    included in policyholder account balances. The advances on these
    agreements are collateralized by residential mortgage-backed
    securities with fair values of $4.8 billion at
    December 31, 2007. MLIC did not have any funding agreements
    with the FHLB of NY at December 31, 2006.

MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds
    $64 million and $54 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of NY at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    which is included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also
    entered into repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for
    cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket
    lien on MetLife Bank’s residential mortgages and
    mortgage-backed securities to collateralize MetLife Bank’s
    obligations under the repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank
    maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use,
    commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral
    as long as there is no event of default and the remaining
    qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral
    maintenance level. The repurchase agreements and the related
    security agreement represented by this blanket lien provide that
    upon any event of default by MetLife Bank,



the FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the amount of
    MetLife Bank’s liability under the outstanding repurchase
    agreements. The amount of the Company’s liability for
    repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY was $1.2 billion
    and $998 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which is included in long-term debt. The advances
    on these repurchase agreements are collateralized by residential
    mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans with
    fair values of $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2007
    and 2006.

    deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or repledged, and
    which has not been recorded on its consolidated balance sheets.
    The amount of this collateral was $40 million and
    $100 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Description
    of Plans

Plan
    Description Overview

The Subsidiaries sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula.
    The traditional formula provides benefits based upon years of
    credited service and either final average or career average
    earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical or
    notional accounts, which credit participants with benefits equal
    to a percentage of eligible pay, as well as earnings credits,
    determined annually based upon the average annual rate of
    interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. As of
    December 31, 2007, virtually all of the Subsidiaries’
    obligations have been calculated using the traditional formula.
    The non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits,
    in excess of amounts permitted by governmental agencies, to
    certain executive level employees.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for a covered subsidiary, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

Financial
    Summary

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

(“SFAS 87”), as amended, establishes the
    accounting for pension plan obligations. Under SFAS 87, the
    projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested
    and non-vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary
    levels. The accumulated pension benefit obligation
    (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of vested and
    non-vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary
    levels. The PBO and ABO of the pension plans are set forth in
    the following section.

Prior to December 31, 2006, SFAS 87 also required the
    recognition of an additional minimum pension liability and an
    intangible asset (limited to unrecognized prior service cost) if
    the market value of pension plan assets was less than the ABO at
    the measurement date. The excess of the additional minimum
    pension liability over the allowable intangible asset was
    charged, net of taxes, to accumulated other comprehensive
    income. The Company’s additional minimum pension liability
    was $78 million, and the intangible asset was
    $12 million, at December 31, 2005. The excess of the
    additional minimum pension liability over the intangible asset
    of $66 million ($41 million, net of income tax) was
    recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
    income. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s additional
    minimum pension liability was $92 million. The additional
    minimum pension liability of $59 million, net of income tax
    of $33 million, was recorded as a reduction of accumulated
    other comprehensive income.



SFAS No. 106,

Employers Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions,

as amended,
    (“SFAS 106”), establishes the accounting for
    expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) which represents the actuarial present value
    of all postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents. Unlike the PBO for
    pensions, the EPBO is not recorded in the financial statements
    but is used in measuring the periodic expense. The accumulated
    postretirement plan benefit obligation (“APBO”)
    represents the actuarial present value of future postretirement
    benefits attributed to employee services rendered through a
    particular date. The APBO is recorded in the financial
    statements and is set forth below.

As described more fully in “— Adoption of New
    Accounting Pronouncements”, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

—

an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and SFAS No. 132(r)

(“SFAS 158”), effective December 31,
    2006. Upon adoption, the Company was required to recognize in
    the consolidated balance sheet the funded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Funded status is
    measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
    and the benefit obligation, which is the PBO for pension plans
    and the APBO for other postretirement plans. The change to
    recognize funded status eliminated the additional minimum
    pension liability provisions of SFAS 87. In addition, the
    Company recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, net of income tax, those amounts of
    actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and
    the remaining net transition asset or obligation that had not
    yet been included in net periodic benefit cost at the date of
    adoption. The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction
    of $744 million, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which is included as a component of total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity. The following table
    summarizes the adjustments to the December 31, 2006
    consolidated balance sheet in order to effect the adoption of
    SFAS 158.

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

Pension
    Plan Obligations

Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit pension
    plans are determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions,
    from which actual results may vary. Some of the more significant
    of these assumptions include the discount rate used to determine
    the present value of future benefit payments, the expected rate
    of compensation increases and average expected retirement age.

Assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations were as
    follows:

December 31,



Weighted average discount rate

6.65%

6.00%

Rate of compensation increase

3.5% - 8%

3% - 8%

Average expected retirement age



The discount rate is determined annually based on the yield,
    measured on a yield to worst basis, of a hypothetical portfolio
    constructed of high-quality debt instruments available on the
    valuation date, which would provide the necessary future cash
    flows to pay the aggregate PBO when due. The yield of this
    hypothetical portfolio, constructed of bonds rated AA or better
    by Moody’s Investors Services (“Moody’s) resulted
    in a discount rate of approximately 6.65% and 6.00% for the
    defined pension plans as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

A decrease (increase) in the discount rate increases (decreases)
    the PBO. This increase (decrease) to the PBO is amortized into
    earnings as an actuarial loss (gain). Based on the
    December 31, 2007 PBO, a 25 basis point decrease
    (increase) in the discount rate would result in an increase
    (decrease) in the PBO of $159 million.

At the end of 2007, total net actuarial losses were
    $623 million as compared to $1,123 million in 2006. In
    2007, the majority of the reduction in the actuarial losses is
    due to the increase in the discount rate to 6.65% in 2007 from
    6.00% in 2006. These losses will be amortized on a straight-line
    basis over the average remaining service period of active
    employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plans.
    At the end of 2007, the average remaining service period of
    active employees was 8.2 years for the pension plans.

As the benefits provided under the defined pension plans are
    calculated as a percentage of future earnings, an assumption of
    future compensation increases is required to determine the
    projected benefit obligation. These rates are derived through
    periodic analysis of historical demographic data conducted by an
    independent actuarial firm. The last review of such data was
    conducted using salary information through 2006 and the Company
    believes that no circumstances have subsequently occurred that
    would result in a material change to the compensation rate
    assumptions.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

The APBO is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions,
    from which actual results may vary. Some of the more significant
    of these assumptions include the discount rate, the healthcare
    cost trend rate and the average expected retirement age. The
    determination of the discount rate and the average expected
    retirement age are substantially consistent with the
    determination described previously for the pension plans.



The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO and net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

December 31,



Pre-Medicare eligible claims

8.5% down to 5% in 2014

9.0% down to 5% in 2014

Medicare eligible claims

10.5% down to 5% in 2018

11.0% down to 5% in 2018

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates may have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans. A
    one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend
    rates would have the following effects:

A decrease (increase) in the discount rate increases (decreases)
    the APBO. This increase (decrease) to the APBO is amortized into
    earnings as an actuarial loss (gain). Based on the
    December 31, 2007 APBO, a 25 basis point decrease
    (increase) in the discount rate would result in an increase
    (decrease) in the APBO of $44 million.

At the end of 2007, total net actuarial gains were
    $112 million as compared to net actuarial losses of
    $328 million in 2006. The majority of the net actuarial
    gains are due to the increase in the discount rate, an increased
    number of retirees opting out of plan benefits and lower than
    expected medical inflation. These gains will be amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
    active employees expected to receive benefits under the other
    postretirement benefit plans. At the end of 2007, the average
    remaining service period of active employees was 8.3 years
    for the other postretirement benefit plans.

In 2004, the Company adopted the guidance in

FSP 106-2

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of

(“FSP 106-2”),

to account for future subsidies to be received under the
    Prescription Drug Act. The Company began receiving these
    subsidies during 2006. A summary of the reduction to the APBO
    and related reduction to the components of net periodic other
    postretirement benefit cost is as follows:

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Pension
    Cost

Net periodic pension cost is comprised of the following:

i)

Service Cost — Service cost is the increase in the
    projected pension benefit obligation resulting from benefits
    payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service rendered
    during the current year.

ii)

Interest Cost on the Liability — Interest cost is the
    time value adjustment on the projected pension benefit
    obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    pension fund assets in a particular year.

iv)

Amortization of Prior Service Cost — This cost relates
    to the increase or decrease to pension benefit cost for service
    provided in prior years due to amendments in plans or initiation
    of new plans. As the economic benefits of these costs are
    realized in the future periods, these costs are amortized to
    pension expense over the expected service years of the employees.

v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains or Losses —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on pension plan
    assets or projected pension benefit obligation during a
    particular period. These gains and losses are accumulated and,
    to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected
    pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan
    assets, they are amortized into pension expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.

The Subsidiaries recognized pension expense of $98 million
    in 2007 as compared to $180 million in 2006 and
    $146 million in 2005. The major components of net periodic
    pension cost described above were as follows:

$


The increase in expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily a result
    of both increases in service and interest cost and amortization
    of net actuarial losses resulting largely from lower discount
    rates, partially offset by the impact of an increase in the
    expected return on plan assets due to a larger plan assets base.

The decrease in expense from 2006 to 2007 was primarily the
    result of an increase in the expected return on plan assets and
    a decrease in amortization of net actuarial losses resulting
    from the $350 million contribution made in 2006. The
    increase in the interest cost resulted from the increase in the
    discount rate.

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service cost for
    the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit
    cost over the next year are both $14 million.

The weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net
    periodic pension cost was 6.00%, 5.82% and 5.83% for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan
    assets used to calculate the net periodic pension cost for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 8.25%,
    8.25% and 8.50%, respectively. The expected rate of return on
    plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various
    asset sectors in which the plan invests, weighted by target
    allocation percentages. Anticipated future performance is based
    on long-term



historical returns of the plan assets by sector, adjusted for
    the Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on the performance
    of the markets. While the precise expected return derived using
    this approach will fluctuate from year to year, the
    Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term assumption
    constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from
    the derived rate. The actual net return on the investments has
    been an approximation of the estimated return for the pension
    plan in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Based on the December 31, 2007 asset balances, a
    25 basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of
    return on plan assets would result in a decrease (increase) in
    net periodic benefit cost of $15 million for the pension
    plans.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Cost

The net periodic other postretirement benefit cost consists of
    the following:

i)

Service Cost — Service cost is the increase in the
    expected postretirement plan benefit obligation resulting from
    benefits payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service
    rendered during the current year.

ii)

Interest Cost on the Liability — Interest cost is the
    time value adjustment on the expected postretirement benefit
    obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    other postretirement fund assets in a particular year.

iv)

Amortization of Prior Service Cost — This cost relates
    to the increase or decrease to other postretirement benefit cost
    for service provided in prior years due to amendments in plans
    or initiation of new plans. As the economic benefits of these
    costs are realized in the future periods these costs are
    amortized to other postretirement benefit expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.

v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains or Losses —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on other
    postretirement benefit plan assets or expected postretirement
    plan benefit obligation during a particular year. These gains
    and losses are accumulated and, to the extent they exceed 10% of
    the greater of the accumulated postretirement plan benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, they are
    amortized into other postretirement benefit expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.

The Subsidiaries recognized other postretirement benefit expense
    of $9 million in 2007 as compared to $60 million in
    2006 and $77 million in 2005. The major components of net
    periodic other postretirement benefit cost described above were
    as follows:

The decrease in benefit cost from 2005 to 2006 was due to
    changes in plan benefits resulting in decreased service and
    interest cost and increases in amortization of prior service
    costs. The continued decrease from 2006 to 2007 primarily
    resulted from a change in the Medicare integration methodology
    for certain retirees.



The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service credit for
    the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized
    from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next year are less than $1 million
    and $37 million, respectively.

The weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net
    periodic postretirement cost was 6.00%, 5.82% and 5.98% for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used
    to calculate the net other postretirement benefit cost for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 7.47%,
    7.42% and 7.51%, respectively. The expected rate of return on
    plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various
    asset sectors in which the plan invests, weighted by target
    allocation percentages. Anticipated future performance is based
    on long-term historical returns of the plan assets by sector,
    adjusted for the Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on
    the performance of the markets. While the precise expected
    return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to
    year, the Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term
    assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable
    tolerance from the derived rate. The actual net return on the
    investments has been an approximation of the estimated return
    for the other postretirement plans in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Based on the December 31, 2007 asset balances, a
    25 basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of
    return on plan assets would result in a decrease (increase) in
    net periodic benefit cost of $3 million for the other
    postretirement plans.

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

Pension
    Plan Assets

Substantially all assets of the pension plans are invested
    within group annuity and life insurance contracts issued by the
    Subsidiaries. The majority of assets are held in separate
    accounts established by the Subsidiaries. The account values of
    assets held with the Subsidiaries were $6,440 million and
    $6,205 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The terms of these contracts are consistent in all
    material respects with those the Subsidiaries offer to
    unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated.

Net assets invested in separate accounts are stated at the
    aggregate fair value of units of participation. Such value
    reflects accumulated contributions, dividends and realized and
    unrealized investment gains or losses apportioned to such
    contributions, less withdrawals, distributions, allocable
    expenses relating to the purchase, sale and maintenance of the
    assets and an allocable part of such separate accounts’
    investment expenses.

Separate account investments in fixed income and equity
    securities are generally carried at published market value, or
    if published market values are not readily available, at
    estimated market values. Investments in short-term fixed income
    securities are generally reflected as cash equivalents and
    carried at fair value. Real estate investments are carried at
    estimated fair value based on appraisals performed by
    third-party real estate appraisal firms, and generally,
    determined by discounting projected cash flows over periods of
    time and at interest rates deemed appropriate for each
    investment. Information on the physical value of the property
    and the sales prices of comparable properties is used to
    corroborate fair value estimates. Estimated fair value of hedge
    fund net assets is generally determined by third-party pricing
    vendors using quoted market prices or through the use of pricing
    models which are affected by changes in interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads,
    market supply and demand, market volatility and liquidity.

Target allocations of assets are determined with the objective

    through adequate asset diversification. Adjustments are made to
    target allocations based on an assessment of the impact of
    economic factors and market conditions.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

Substantially all assets of the other postretirement benefit
    plans are invested within life insurance and reserve contracts
    issued by the Subsidiaries. The majority of assets are held in
    separate accounts established by the Subsidiaries. The account
    values of assets held with the Subsidiaries were
    $1,125 million and $1,116 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The terms of
    these contracts are consistent in all material respects with
    those the Subsidiaries offer to unaffiliated parties that are
    similarly situated.

The valuation of separate accounts and the investments within
    such separate accounts invested in by the other postretirement
    plans are similar to that described in the preceding section on
    pension plans.

Funding
    and Cash Flows of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Obligations

Pension
    Plan Obligations

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plans to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of ERISA, as amended. In accordance with such
    practice, no contributions were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 or 2006. No contributions will be
    required for 2008. The Subsidiaries did not make any
    discretionary contributions to the qualified pension plans
    during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the Subsidiaries made
    discretionary contributions of $350 million. The
    Subsidiaries expect to make additional discretionary
    contributions of $150 million in 2008.



Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as they become
    due under the provision of the plans. These payments totaled
    $50 million and $38 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These benefit
    payments are expected to be at approximately the same level in
    2008.

Gross pension benefit payments for the next ten years, which
    reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to
    be as follows:

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

Other postretirement benefits represent a non-vested,
    non-guaranteed obligation of the Subsidiaries and current
    regulations do not require specific funding levels for these
    benefits. While the Subsidiaries have funded such plans in
    advance, it has been the Subsidiaries’ practice to
    primarily use their general assets, net of participants’
    contributions, to pay claims as they come due in lieu of
    utilizing plan assets. Total payments equaled $174 million
    and $152 million for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

The Subsidiaries’ expect to make contributions of
    $116 million, net of participants’ contributions,
    towards the other postretirement plan obligations in 2008. As
    noted previously, the Subsidiaries expect to receive subsidies
    under the Prescription Drug Act to partially offset such
    payments.

Gross other postretirement benefit payments for the next ten

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require insurers doing business within the
    jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are
    organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer



engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover
    assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.
    Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments are as
    follows:

    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material
    effect on its consolidated results of operations, except insofar
    as inflation may affect interest rates.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Income
    Taxes

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48.
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    tax recognized in a company’s financial statements.
    FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is
    “more likely than not” that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities
    before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial
    statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
    measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties,
    along with any related interest and penalties. Previously
    recorded income tax benefits that no longer meet this standard
    are required to be charged to earnings in the period that such
    determination is made.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized a $52 million increase in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, a $4 million decrease in the
    interest liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and a
    corresponding reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of
    retained earnings of $37 million, net of $11 million
    of minority interest.

Insurance
    Contracts

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted

SOP 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

.

SOP 05-1

which provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises
    for DAC on internal replacements of insurance and investment
    contracts other than those specifically described in SFAS
    No. 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.

SOP 05-1

defines an internal replacement and is effective for internal
    replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. In addition, in February 2007, the
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) issued related Technical Practice Aids
    (“TPAs”) to provide further clarification of

SOP 05-1.

The TPAs became effective concurrently with the adoption of

SOP 05-1.



As a result of the adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs, if an internal replacement modification
    substantially changes a contract, then the DAC is written off
    immediately through income and any new deferrable costs
    associated with the new replacement are deferred. If a contract
    modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC
    amortization on the original contract will continue and any
    acquisition costs associated with the related modification are
    immediately expensed.

The adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs resulted in a reduction to DAC and VOBA on
    January 1, 2007 and an acceleration of the amortization
    period relating primarily to the Company’s group life and
    health insurance contracts that contain certain rate reset
    provisions. Prior to the adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts was amortized over the expected renewable
    life of the contract. Upon adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts is to be amortized over the rate reset
    period. The impact as of January 1, 2007 was a cumulative
    effect adjustment of $292 million, net of income tax of
    $161 million, which was recorded as a reduction to retained
    earnings.

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 158. The pronouncement revises financial reporting
    standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans by requiring the:

(i)

recognition in the statement of financial position of the funded
    status of defined benefit plans measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation for
    pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation for other postretirement plans;

(ii)

recognition as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net of income tax, those amounts of actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and net asset
    or obligation at transition that have not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit costs as of the end of the year of adoption;

(iii)

recognition of subsequent changes in funded status as a
    component of other comprehensive income;

(iv)

measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations as of the
    date of the statement of financial position; and

(v)

disclosure of additional information about the effects on the
    employer’s statement of financial position.

The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of
    $744 million, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which is included as a component of total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity. As the Company’s
    measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans is already December 31 there was no impact of
    adoption due to changes in measurement date. See also
    “Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”

Stock
    Compensation Plans

As described previously, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123(r) including supplemental
    application guidance issued by the SEC in Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

(“SAB 107”) — using the modified
    prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, results for prior periods have
    not been restated. SFAS 123(r) requires that the cost of
    all stock-based transactions be measured at fair value and
    recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to
    provide goods or services in exchange for the award. The Company
    had previously adopted the fair value method of accounting for
    stock-based awards as prescribed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”) on a prospective basis effective
    January 1, 2003, and prior to January 1, 2003,
    accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25. The Company did not
    modify the substantive terms of any existing awards prior to
    adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation
    expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards granted beginning January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r).



The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant
    impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations as all stock-based awards accounted for under the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 had vested prior to
    the adoption date and the Company had adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1, 2003.

SFAS 123 allowed forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    recognized as a reduction of compensation expense in the period
    in which the forfeiture occurred. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123(r), the Company changed its policy and now
    incorporates an estimate of future forfeitures into the
    determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense
    over the requisite service period. The impact of this change in
    accounting policy was not significant to the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations as of the date of
    adoption.

Additionally, for awards granted after adoption, the Company
    changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock-based
    awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such
    expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the
    period to attainment of retirement-eligibility.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(r), the Company presented
    tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
    options within operating cash flows in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows. SFAS 123(r) requires tax benefits
    resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options be classified and reported as a
    financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has adopted guidance relating to derivative
    financial instruments as follows:

•

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
    Hybrid Instruments

(“SFAS 155”).
    SFAS 155 amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging

(“SFAS 133”) and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 allows financial
    instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for
    as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative
    from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole
    instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other
    changes, SFAS 155:

(i)

clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
    are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133;

(ii)

establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
    financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding
    derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that
    contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;

(iii)

clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
    subordination are not embedded derivatives; and

(iv)

amends SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a
    qualifying special-purpose entity (“QSPE”) from
    holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
    beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
    interest.

The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,

Embedded
    Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized
    Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets

(“Issue
    B40”). Issue B40 clarifies that a securitized interest in
    prepayable financial assets is not subject to the conditions in
    paragraph 13(b) of SFAS 133, if it meets both of the
    following criteria: (i) the right to accelerate the
    settlement if the securitized interest cannot be controlled by
    the investor; and (ii) the securitized interest itself does
    not contain an embedded derivative (including an interest
    rate-related derivative) for which bifurcation would be required
    other than an embedded derivative that results solely from the
    embedded call options in the underlying financial assets. The
    adoption of Issue B40 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B38,

Embedded Derivatives: Evaluation of Net Settlement with
    Respect to the Settlement of a Debt Instrument



through Exercise of an Embedded Put Option or Call Option

(“Issue B38”) and SFAS 133 Implementation Issue
    No. B39,

Embedded Derivatives: Application of
    Paragraph 13(b) to Call Options That Are Exercisable Only
    by the Debtor

(“Issue B39”). Issue B38 clarifies
    that the potential settlement of a debtor’s obligation to a
    creditor occurring upon exercise of a put or call option meets
    the net settlement criteria of SFAS 133. Issue B39
    clarifies that an embedded call option, in which the underlying
    is an interest rate or interest rate index, that can accelerate
    the settlement of a debt host financial instrument should not be
    bifurcated and fair valued if the right to accelerate the
    settlement can be exercised only by the debtor (issuer/borrower)
    and the investor will recover substantially all of its initial
    net investment. The adoption of Issues B38 and B39 did not have
    a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Other

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Staff
    Position (“FSP”) Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”)

00-19-2,

Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements

(“FSP

EITF 00-19-2”).

FSP

EITF 00-19-2

specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies.

The adoption of FSP

EITF 00-19-2

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of
    Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction

(“FSP 13-2”).

FSP 13-2

amends SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, to
    require that a lessor review the projected timing of income tax
    cash flows generated by a leveraged lease annually or more
    frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a change in
    timing has occurred or is projected to occur. In addition,

FSP 13-2

requires that the change in the net investment balance resulting
    from the recalculation be recognized as a gain or loss from
    continuing operations in the same line item in which leveraged
    lease income is recognized in the year in which the assumption
    is changed. The adoption of

FSP 13-2

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). Among other
    requirements, SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a
    servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes
    an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a
    servicing contract in certain situations. The adoption of
    SFAS 156 did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective November 15, 2006, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”).
    SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements
    should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
    year financial statements for purposes of assessing materiality.
    SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using
    both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement
    that, when relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
    considered, is material. SAB 108 permits companies to
    initially apply its provisions by either restating prior
    financial statements or recording a cumulative effect adjustment
    to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2006 with an offsetting adjustment to retained
    earnings for errors that were previously deemed immaterial but
    are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively EITF Issue

No. 05-7,

Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded
    in Debt Instruments and Related Issues

(“EITF 05-7”).

EITF 05-7

provides guidance on whether a modification of conversion
    options embedded in debt results in an extinguishment of that
    debt. In certain situations, companies may change the terms of
    an embedded conversion option as part of a debt modification.
    The EITF concluded that the change in the fair value of an
    embedded conversion option upon modification should be included
    in the analysis of EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

, to determine whether a modification or
    extinguishment has occurred and that a change in the fair value
    of a conversion option should be recognized



upon the modification as a discount (or premium) associated with
    the debt, and an increase (or decrease) in additional paid-in
    capital. The adoption of

EITF 05-7

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-8,

Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a
    Beneficial Conversion Feature

(“EITF 05-8”).

EITF 05-8

concludes that: (i) the issuance of convertible debt with a
    beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that
    should be accounted for as a temporary difference; and
    (ii) the establishment of the deferred tax liability for
    the basis difference should result in an adjustment to
    additional paid-in capital.

EITF 05-8

was applied retrospectively for all instruments with a
    beneficial conversion feature accounted for in accordance with
    EITF Issue

No. 98-5,

Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios

, and EITF Issue

No. 00-27,

Application of Issue

No. 98-5

to Certain Convertible Instruments.

The adoption of

EITF 05-8

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
    Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
    Statement No. 3

(“SFAS 154”).
    SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior
    periods’ financial statements for a voluntary change in
    accounting principle unless it is deemed impracticable. It also
    requires that a change in the method of depreciation,
    amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets
    be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate rather than
    a change in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS 154
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”).

EITF 04-5

provides a framework for determining whether a general partner
    controls and should consolidate a limited partnership or a
    similar entity in light of certain rights held by the limited
    partners. The consensus also provides additional guidance on
    substantive rights.

EITF 04-5

was effective after June 29, 2005 for all newly formed
    partnerships and for any pre-existing limited partnerships that
    modified their partnership agreements after that date. For all
    other limited partnerships,

EITF 04-5

required adoption by January 1, 2006 through a cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle recorded in opening
    equity or applied retrospectively by adjusting prior period
    financial statements. The adoption of the provisions of

EITF 04-5

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective November 9, 2005, the Company prospectively
    adopted the guidance in FSP

No. FAS 140-2,

Clarification of the Application of Paragraphs 40(b) and
    40(c) of FAS 140

(“FSP 140-2”).

FSP 140-2

clarified certain criteria relating to derivatives and
    beneficial interests when considering whether an entity
    qualifies as a QSPE. Under

FSP 140-2,

the criteria must only be met at the date the QSPE issues
    beneficial interests or when a derivative financial instrument
    needs to be replaced upon the occurrence of a specified event
    outside the control of the transferor. The adoption of

FSP 140-2

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an
    amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

(“SFAS 153”). SFAS 153 amended prior
    guidance to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of
    similar productive assets and replaced it with a general
    exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
    commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial
    substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
    change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions
    of SFAS 153 were required to be applied prospectively for
    fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption
    of SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-6,

Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold
    Improvements

(“EITF 05-6”).

EITF 05-6

provides guidance on determining the amortization period for
    leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or
    acquired subsequent to lease inception. As required by

EITF 05-6,

the Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis which
    had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.



In June 2005, the FASB completed its review of EITF Issue

No. 03-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
    Application to Certain Investments

(“EITF 03-1”).

EITF 03-1

provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when
    an impairment of debt and marketable equity securities and
    investments accounted for under the cost method should be
    considered other-than-temporary and recognized in income.

EITF 03-1

also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures
    for debt and marketable equity securities classified as
    available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under
    SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities

, that are impaired at the balance
    sheet date but for which an other-than-temporary impairment has
    not been recognized. The FASB decided not to provide additional
    guidance on the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment but
    has issued FSP Nos.

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its
    Application to Certain Investments

(“FSP 115-1”),

which nullifies the accounting guidance on the determination of
    whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired as set
    forth in

EITF 03-1.

As required by

FSP 115-1,

the Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis, which
    had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, and has provided the required disclosures.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
    Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of

(“FSP 109-2”).

The AJCA introduced a one-time dividend received deduction on
    the repatriation of certain earnings to a U.S. taxpayer.

FSP 109-2

provides companies additional time beyond the financial
    reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the
    AJCA on their plans to repatriate foreign earnings for purposes
    of applying SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes.

During 2005, the Company recorded a $27 million
    income tax benefit related to the repatriation of foreign
    earnings pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 965 for
    which a U.S. deferred income tax provision had previously
    been recorded. As of January 1, 2006, the repatriation
    provision of the AJCA no longer applies to the Company.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

Fair
    Value

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about
    fair value measurements. Effective January 1, 2008, the
    Company adopted SFAS 157 and applied the provisions of the
    statement prospectively to assets and liabilities measured and
    disclosed at fair value. In addition to new disclosure
    requirements, the adoption of SFAS 157 changes the
    valuation of certain freestanding derivatives by moving from a
    mid to bid pricing convention as well as changing the valuation
    of embedded derivatives associated with annuity contracts. The
    change in valuation of embedded derivatives associated with
    annuity contracts results from the incorporation of risk margins
    and the Company’s own credit standing in their valuation.
    While the Company does not expect such changes in valuation to
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements at January 1, 2008, the addition of risk margins
    and the Company’s own credit spread in the valuation of
    embedded derivatives associated with annuity contracts may
    result in significant volatility in the Company’s
    consolidated net income.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities
    the option to measure most financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value at specified election dates and to
    report related unrealized gains and losses in earnings. The fair
    value option is generally applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is generally an irrevocable election. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company has elected the fair value
    option on fixed maturity securities backing certain pension
    products sold in Brazil. Previously, these fixed maturity
    securities were accounted for as available-for-sale securities
    in accordance with FAS 115. The Company’s insurance
    joint venture in Japan also elected the fair value option for
    its single premium deferred annuities and supporting assets.
    These elections are not expected to have a material impact on
    the Company’s retained earnings or equity as of
    January 1, 2008.

In June 2007, the AICPA issued

SOP 07-1,

Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide
    Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and
    Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment
    Companies

(“SOP 07-1”)

. Upon adoption of

SOP 07-1,

the Company must also adopt the provisions of FASB Staff
    Position No. FSP

FIN 46(r)-7,

Application of FASB Interpretation No. 46 to Investment
    Companies

(“FSP

FIN 46(r)-7”),

which permanently exempts investment companies from applying the
    provisions of FIN No. 46(r),

Consolidation of



Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

, and its
    December 2003 revision (“FIN 46(r)”) to
    investments carried at fair value.

SOP 07-1

provides guidance for determining whether an entity falls within
    the scope of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide

Investment
    Companies

and whether investment company accounting should
    be retained by a parent company upon consolidation of an
    investment company subsidiary or by an equity method investor in
    an investment company. In certain circumstances,

SOP 07-1

precludes retention of specialized accounting for investment
    companies (i.e., fair value accounting), when similar direct
    investments exist in the consolidated group and are measured on
    a basis inconsistent with that applied to investment companies.
    Additionally,

SOP 07-1

precludes retention of specialized accounting for investment
    companies if the reporting entity does not distinguish through
    documented policies the nature and type of investments to be
    held in the investment companies from those made in the
    consolidated group where other accounting guidance is being
    applied. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. SOP
    7-1-1,

Effective Date of AICPA Statement of Position 07-1,

which delays indefinitely the effective date of SOP 07-1.
    The Company is closely monitoring further FASB developments.

In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP

No. FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

(“FSP 39-1”).

FSP 39-1

amends FIN No. 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to
    Certain Contracts

(“FIN 39”), to permit a
    reporting entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the
    right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the
    obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) against fair
    value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed
    with the same counterparty under the same master netting
    arrangement that have been offset in accordance with
    FIN 39.

FSP 39-1

also amends FIN 39 for certain terminology modifications.

FSP 39-1

applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.

FSP 39-1

will be applied retrospectively, unless it is impracticable to
    do so. Upon adoption of

FSP 39-1,

the Company is permitted to change its accounting policy to
    offset or not offset fair value amounts recognized for
    derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. The
    adoption of

FSP 39-1

will not have an impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations — A
    Replacement of FASB Statement No. 141

(“SFAS 141(r)”) and SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”) which are effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008. Under
    SFAS 141(r) and SFAS 160:

•

All business combinations (whether full, partial, or
    “step” acquisitions) result in all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at fair
    value, with limited exceptions.

•

Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred;
    restructuring costs associated with a business combination are
    generally expensed as incurred subsequent to the acquisition
    date.

•

The fair value of the purchase price, including the issuance of
    equity securities, is determined on the acquisition date.

•

Certain acquired contingent liabilities are recorded at fair
    value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at
    either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under
    existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies.

•

Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income
    tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect
    income tax expense.

•

Noncontrolling interests (formerly known as “minority
    interests”) are valued at fair value at the acquisition
    date and are presented as equity rather than liabilities.

•

When control is attained on previously noncontrolling interests,
    the previously held equity interests are remeasured at fair
    value and a gain or loss is recognized.

•

Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a
    change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.

•

When control is lost in a partial disposition, realized gains or
    losses are recorded on equity ownership sold and the remaining
    ownership interest is remeasured and holding gains or losses are
    recognized.



The pronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008 and apply prospectively to
    business combinations. Presentation and disclosure requirements
    related to noncontrolling interests must be retrospectively
    applied. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS 141(r) on its accounting for future acquisitions and
    the impact of SFAS 160 on its consolidated financial
    statements.

Other

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140-3,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase
    Financing Transactions

(“FSP 140-3”). FSP 140-3
    provides guidance for evaluating whether to account for a
    transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing as a
    single transaction or as two separate transactions. FSP 140-3 is
    effective prospectively for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company
    is currently evaluating the impact of FSP FAS 140-3 on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In January 2008, the FASB cleared SFAS 133 Implementation
    Issue E23,

Clarification of the Application of the Shortcut
    Method

(“Issue E23”). Issue E23 amends
    SFAS 133 by permitting interest rate swaps to have a
    non-zero fair value at inception, as long as the difference
    between the transaction price (zero) and the fair value (exit
    price), as defined by SFAS 157, is solely attributable to a
    bid-ask spread. In addition, entities would not be precluded
    from assuming no ineffectiveness in a hedging relationship of
    interest rate risk involving an interest bearing asset or
    liability in situations where the hedged item is not recognized
    for accounting purposes until settlement date as long as the
    period between trade date and settlement date of the hedged item
    is consistent with generally established conventions in the
    marketplace. Issue E23 is effective for hedging relationships
    designated on or after January 1, 2008. The Company does
    not expect the adoption of Issue E23 to have a material impact
    on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified as final the consensus on
    EITF Issue

No. 07-6,

Accounting for the Sale of Real Estate When the Agreement
    Includes a Buy-Sell Clause

(“EITF 07-6”).

EITF 07-6

addresses whether the existence of a buy-sell arrangement would
    preclude partial sales treatment when real estate is sold to a
    jointly owned entity. The consensus concludes that the existence
    of a buy-sell clause does not necessarily preclude partial sale
    treatment under current guidance.

EITF 07-6

applies prospectively to new arrangements entered into and
    assessments on existing transactions performed in fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of

EITF 07-6

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In November 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 109,

Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value through
    Earnings

(“SAB 109”), which amends
    SAB No. 105,

Application of Accounting Principles
    to Loan Commitments

. SAB 109 provides guidance on:
    (i) incorporating expected net future cash flows when
    related to the associated servicing of a loan when measuring
    fair value; and (ii) broadening the SEC staff’s view
    that internally-developed intangible assets should not be
    recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative loan
    commitment or to written loan commitments that are accounted for
    at fair value through earnings. Internally-developed intangible
    assets are not considered a component of the related
    instruments. SAB 109 is effective for derivative loan
    commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning
    after December 15, 2007. The adoption of SAB 109 will
    not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Investments

The Company’s primary investment objective is to optimize,
    net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and
    risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and
    liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The
    Company is exposed to three primary sources of investment risk:

•

credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the
    continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of
    principal and interest;

•

interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow
    variability associated with changes in market interest
    rates; and

•

market valuation risk.



The Company manages risk through in-house fundamental analysis
    of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and
    real estate properties. The Company also manages credit risk and
    market valuation risk through industry and issuer
    diversification and asset allocation. For real estate and
    agricultural assets, the Company manages credit risk and market
    valuation risk through geographic, property type and product
    type diversification and asset allocation. The Company manages
    interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management
    strategies; product design, such as the use of market value
    adjustment features and surrender charges; and proactive
    monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of
    its products, such as the resetting of credited interest and
    dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. The
    Company also uses certain derivative instruments in the
    management of credit and interest rate risks.

Fixed
    Maturity and Equity Securities Available-for-Sale

Fixed maturity securities consisted principally of publicly
    traded and privately placed debt securities, and represented 70%
    and 73% of total cash and invested assets at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Based on estimated fair value,
    public fixed maturity securities represented
    $205.4 billion, or 85%, and $209.2 billion, or 86%, of
    total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Based on estimated fair value, private fixed
    maturity securities represented $36.8 billion, or 15%, and
    $32.7 billion, or 14%, of total fixed maturity securities
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair
    values are estimated using present value or valuation
    techniques. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market information and
    judgments about the financial instruments, including estimates
    of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the
    credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors
    considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate,
    maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
    requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer and
    quoted market prices of comparable securities.

The Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed
    maturity investments of insurers for regulatory reporting
    purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment
    categories called “NAIC designations.” The NAIC
    ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the
    Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations
    (“NRSROs”) for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2
    include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated
    “Baa3” or higher by Moody’s, or rated
    “BBB-” or higher by Standard & Poor’s
    (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Insurance Group
    (“Fitch”)), by such rating organizations. NAIC ratings
    3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment
    grade (rated “Ba1” or lower by Moody’s, or rated
    “BB+” or lower by S&P and Fitch).

The following table presents the Company’s total fixed
    maturity securities by NRSRO designation and the equivalent
    ratings of the NAIC, as well as the percentage, based on
    estimated fair value, that each designation is comprised of at:

Amounts presented are based on rating agency designations.
    Comparisons between NAIC ratings and rating agency designations
    are published by the NAIC. The rating agency designations are
    based on availability and the midpoint of the applicable ratings
    among Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. If no rating is
    available from a rating agency, then the MetLife rating is used.

The Company held fixed maturity securities at estimated fair
    values that were below investment grade or not rated by an
    independent rating agency that totaled $17.7 billion and
    $17.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. These securities had net unrealized gains (losses)
    of ($108) million and $627 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Non-income
    producing fixed maturity securities were $13 million and
    $16 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Net unrealized gains associated with non-income
    producing fixed maturity securities were $12 million and
    $4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Equity securities primarily consist of investments in common and
    preferred stocks and mutual fund interests. Such securities
    include private equity securities with an estimated fair value
    of $599 million and $238 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company is not exposed to any significant concentrations of
    credit risk in its equity securities portfolio. The Company is
    exposed to concentrations of credit risk related to
    U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of
    U.S. government corporations and agencies. Additionally, at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had exposure to
    fixed maturity securities backed by sub-prime mortgages with
    estimated fair values of $2.2 billion and
    $3.0 billion, respectively, and unrealized losses of
    $219 million and $5 million, respectively. These
    securities are classified within asset-backed securities in the
    immediately preceding table. At December 31, 2007, 32% have
    been guaranteed by financial guarantors, of which 55% was
    guaranteed by financial guarantors who remain Aaa rated in 2008.
    Overall, at December 31, 2007, $6.7 billion of the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed maturity
    securities were credit enhanced by financial guarantors of which
    $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.7 billion at
    December 31, 2007, are included within state and political
    subdivisions, corporate securities and asset-backed securities,
    respectively, and 80% were guaranteed by financial guarantors
    who remain Aaa rated in 2008.

Fixed Maturity and Equity Security
    Impairment.

The Company classifies all of its
    fixed maturity and equity securities as available-for-sale and
    marks them to market through other comprehensive income, except
    for non-marketable private equities, which are generally carried
    at cost and trading securities which are carried at fair value
    with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net
    investment income. All securities with gross unrealized losses
    at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the
    Company’s process for identifying other-than-temporary
    impairments. The Company writes down to fair value securities
    that it deems to be other-than-temporarily impaired in the
    period the securities are deemed to be so impaired. The
    assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on
    management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair
    value. Management considers a wide range of factors, as
    described in “— Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Investments,” about the security
    issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the
    decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in
    assessing the prospects for near-term recovery.



Inherent in management’s evaluation of the security are
    assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and
    its future earnings potential.

The Company’s review of its fixed maturity and equity
    securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total
    gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%;
    (ii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for
    less than six months; and (iii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater. While
    all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment,
    the Company’s experience indicates that the first two
    categories do not present as great a risk of impairment and,
    often, fair values recover over time as the factors that caused
    the declines improve.

The Company records impairments as investment losses and adjusts
    the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities
    accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis
    for subsequent recoveries in value. Impairments of fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $106 million,
    $82 million and $64 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    Company’s credit-related impairments of fixed maturity and
    equity securities were $86 million, $82 million and
    $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company’s three largest
    impairments totaled $19 million, $33 million and
    $40 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The circumstances that gave rise to
    these impairments were financial restructurings, bankruptcy
    filings or difficult underlying operating environments for the
    entities concerned. During the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company sold or disposed of fixed
    maturity and equity securities at a loss that had a fair value
    of $46.8 billion, $70.3 billion and
    $93.9 billion, respectively. Gross losses excluding
    impairments for fixed maturity and equity securities were
    $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The following tables present the cost or amortized cost, gross
    unrealized loss and number of securities for fixed maturity and
    equity securities, where the estimated fair value had declined

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, $4.3 billion and
    $2.3 billion, respectively, of unrealized losses related to
    securities with an unrealized loss position of less than 20% of
    cost or amortized cost, which represented 4% and 2%,
    respectively, of the cost or amortized cost of such securities.

At December 31, 2007, $577 million of unrealized
    losses related to securities with an unrealized loss position of
    20% or more of cost or amortized cost, which represented 29% of
    the cost or amortized cost of such securities. Of such
    unrealized losses of $577 million, $555 million
    related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position
    for a period of less than six months. At December 31, 2006,
    $24 million of unrealized losses related to securities with
    an unrealized loss position of 20% or more of cost or amortized
    cost, which represented 30% of the cost or amortized cost of
    such securities. Of such unrealized losses of $24 million,
    $12 million related to securities that were in an
    unrealized loss position for a period of less than six months.

The Company held 30 fixed maturity and equity securities, each
    with a gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2007 of
    greater than $10 million. These securities represented 9%,
    or $459 million in the aggregate, of the gross unrealized
    loss on fixed maturity and equity securities. The Company held
    eight fixed maturity and equity securities, each with a gross
    unrealized loss at December 31, 2006 of greater than
    $10 million. These securities represented 7%, or
    $169 million in the aggregate, of the gross unrealized loss
    on fixed maturity and equity securities.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
    $4.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of gross
    unrealized losses related to its fixed maturity and equity
    securities. These securities are concentrated, calculated as a
    percentage of gross unrealized loss, as follows:

As described previously, the Company performs a regular
    evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its investment holdings in accordance with its
    impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such securities
    are other-than-temporarily impaired. One of the criteria which
    the Company considers in its other-than-temporary impairment
    analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of their
    value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized
    cost. The Company’s intent and ability to hold securities
    considers broad portfolio management objectives such as
    asset/liability duration management, issuer and industry segment
    exposures, interest rate views and the overall total return
    focus. In following these portfolio management objectives,
    changes in facts and circumstances that were present in past



reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell securities that
    were held in prior reporting periods. Decisions to sell are
    based on current conditions or the Company’s need to shift
    the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management objectives
    including liquidity needs or duration targets on asset/liability
    managed portfolios. The Company attempts to anticipate these
    types of changes and if a sale decision has been made on an
    impaired security and that security is not expected to recover
    prior to the expected time of sale, the security will be deemed
    other-than-temporarily impaired in the period that the sale
    decision was made and an other-than-temporary impairment loss
    will be recognized.

Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of the
    securities in accordance with its impairment policy, the cause
    of the decline being principally attributable to the general
    rise in interest rates during the holding period, and the
    Company’s current intent and ability to hold the fixed
    maturity and equity securities with unrealized losses for a
    period of time sufficient for them to recover, the Company has
    concluded that the aforementioned securities are not
    other-than-temporarily impaired.

The Company maintains a diversified corporate fixed maturity
    portfolio across industries and issuers. The portfolio does not
    have exposure to any single issuer in excess of 1% of the total
    invested assets of the portfolio. At December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Company’s combined holdings in the ten issuers to
    which it had the greatest exposure totaled $7.8 billion and
    $6.8 billion, respectively, each less than 3% of the
    Company’s total invested assets at such dates. The exposure
    to the largest single issuer of corporate fixed maturity
    securities held at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
    $1.2 billion and $970 million, respectively.

The Company has hedged all of its material exposure to foreign
    currency risk in its corporate fixed maturity portfolio. In the
    Company’s international insurance operations, both its
    assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local
    currencies.

The majority of the residential mortgage-backed securities are
    guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National
    Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
    or the Government National Mortgage Association. Alternative
    residential mortgage loans (“Alt-A”) are a
    classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the
    borrower falls between prime and sub-prime. At December 31,
    2007 and 2006, $56.2 billion and $51.0 billion,
    respectively, or 99% for both, of the residential
    mortgage-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody’s,
    S&P or Fitch. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company’s Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities
    exposure was $6.4 billion and $4.8 billion,
    respectively, with an unrealized loss of $143 million and
    $4 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, $15.5 billion and
    $13.7 billion, respectively, or 87% and 83%, respectively,
    of the commercial mortgage-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA
    by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch.

The Company’s asset-backed securities are diversified both
    by sector and by issuer. Credit card receivables and automobile
    receivables, accounting for about 36% and 11% of the total
    asset-backed holdings, respectively, constitute the largest
    exposures in the Company’s asset-backed securities
    portfolio. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, $6.0 billion
    and $7.9 billion, respectively, or 54% and 57%,
    respectively, of total asset-backed securities were rated
    Aaa/AAA by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch.

The Company’s asset-backed securities included in the
    structured securities table above include exposure to sub-prime
    residential mortgage-backed securities. Sub-prime mortgage
    lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to
    customers with weak credit profiles. The Company is not an
    originator of below-prime mortgages. The Company’s exposure
    exists through investment in asset-backed securities which are
    supported by sub-prime mortgages. The slowing U.S. housing
    market, greater use of affordable mortgage products, and relaxed
    underwriting standards for some originators of below-prime loans
    have recently led to higher delinquency and loss rates,
    especially within the 2006 vintage year. These factors have
    caused a pull-back in market liquidity and repricing of risk,
    which has led to an increase in unrealized losses from
    December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. Based upon the
    analysis of the Company’s exposure to sub-prime mortgages
    through its investment in asset-backed securities, the Company
    expects to receive payments in accordance with the contractual
    terms of the securities.

The following table shows the Company’s exposure to
    asset-backed securities supported by sub-prime mortgage loans by
    credit quality:

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
    $2.2 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of
    asset-backed securities supported by sub-prime mortgage loans as
    outlined in the tables above. At December 31, 2007,
    approximately 96% of the portfolio is rated Aaa, Aa or better of
    which 80% was in vintage year 2005 and prior. At
    December 31, 2006, approximately 91% of the portfolio was
    rated Aaa, Aa or better of which 87% was in vintage year 2005
    and prior. These older vintages benefit from better
    underwriting, improved enhancement levels and higher house price
    appreciation.

Asset-backed securities also include collateralized debt
    obligations backed by sub-prime mortgages at an aggregate cost
    of $64 million with a fair value of $48 million at
    December 31, 2007 and an aggregate cost of $93 million
    with a fair value of $92 million at December 31, 2006,
    which are not included in the tables above.

Assets
    on Deposit and Held in Trust and Assets Pledged as
    Collateral

The Company had investment assets on deposit with regulatory
    agencies with a fair market value of $1.8 billion and
    $1.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, consisting primarily of fixed maturity and equity
    securities. Company securities held in trust to satisfy
    collateral requirements had a cost or amortized cost of
    $7.1 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, consisting primarily of fixed
    maturity and equity securities.

Certain of the Company’s fixed maturity securities are
    pledged as collateral for various transactions as described in
    “ — Composition of Investment Portfolio
    Results — Derivative Financial Instruments —
    Credit Risk.” Additionally, the Company has pledged certain
    of its fixed maturity securities in support of its debt and
    funding agreements as described in “ —
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements — Other
    Commitments.”

Trading
    Securities

The Company has a trading securities portfolio to support
    investment strategies that involve the active and frequent
    purchase and sale of securities, the execution of short sale
    agreements and asset and liability matching strategies for
    certain insurance products. Trading securities and short sale
    agreement liabilities are recorded at fair value with subsequent
    changes in fair value recognized in net investment income
    related to fixed maturity securities.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, trading securities were
    $779 million and $759 million, respectively, and
    liabilities associated with the short sale agreements in the
    trading securities portfolio, which were included in other
    liabilities, were $107 million and $387 million,
    respectively. The Company had pledged $407 million and
    $614 million of its assets, primarily consisting of trading
    securities, as collateral to secure the liabilities associated
    with the short sale agreements in the trading securities
    portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    interest and dividends earned on trading securities in addition
    to the net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on
    the trading securities and the related short sale agreement
    liabilities included within net investment income totaled
    $50 million, $71 million and $14 million,
    respectively. Included within unrealized gains (losses) on such
    trading securities and short sale agreement



liabilities, are changes in fair value of ($4) million,
    $26 million and less than $1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As part of the acquisition of Travelers on July 1, 2005,
    the Company acquired Travelers’ investment in Tribeca
    Citigroup Investments Ltd. (“Tribeca”). Tribeca was a
    feeder fund investment structure whereby the feeder fund invests
    substantially all of its assets in the master fund, Tribeca
    Global Convertible Instruments Ltd. The primary investment
    objective of the master fund is to achieve enhanced
    risk-adjusted return by investing in domestic and foreign
    equities and equity-related securities utilizing such strategies
    as convertible securities arbitrage. At December 31, 2005,
    MetLife was the majority owner of the feeder fund and
    consolidated the fund within its consolidated financial
    statements. Net investment income related to the trading
    activities of Tribeca, which included interest and dividends
    earned on trading securities in addition to the net realized and
    unrealized gains, was $12 million and $6 million for
    the six months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

During the second quarter of 2006, MetLife’s ownership
    interests in Tribeca declined to a position whereby Tribeca is
    no longer consolidated and, as of June 30, 2006, was
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The equity
    method investment at December 31, 2006 of $82 million
    was included in other limited partnership interests. Net
    investment income related to the Company’s equity method
    investment in Tribeca was $9 million for the six months
    ended December 31, 2006.

Mortgage
    and Consumer Loans

The Company’s mortgage and consumer loans are principally
    collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential
    properties, as well as automobiles. Mortgage and consumer loans
    comprised 13.6% and 12.7% of the Company’s total cash and
    invested assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The carrying value of mortgage and consumer loans
    is stated at original cost net of repayments, amortization of
    premiums, accretion of discounts and valuation allowances. The

Restructured, Potentially Delinquent, Delinquent or Under
    Foreclosure.

The Company monitors its mortgage
    loan investments on an ongoing basis, including reviewing loans
    that are restructured, potentially delinquent, delinquent or
    under foreclosure. These loan classifications are consistent
    with those used in industry practice.



The Company defines restructured mortgage loans as loans in
    which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the
    debtor’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the
    debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The Company defines
    potentially delinquent loans as loans that, in management’s
    opinion, have a high probability of becoming delinquent. The
    Company defines delinquent mortgage loans, consistent with
    industry practice, as loans in which two or more interest or
    principal payments are past due. The Company defines mortgage
    loans under foreclosure as loans in which foreclosure
    proceedings have formally commenced.

The Company reviews all mortgage loans on an ongoing basis.
    These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial
    statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property
    inspections, market analysis and tenant creditworthiness.

The Company records valuation allowances for certain loans that
    it deems impaired. The Company’s valuation allowances are
    established both on a loan specific basis for those loans where
    a property or market specific risk has been identified that
    could likely result in a future default, as well as for pools of
    loans with similar high risk characteristics where a property
    specific or market risk has not been identified. Loan specific
    valuation allowances are established for the excess carrying
    value of the mortgage loan over the present value of expected
    future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original
    effective interest rate, the value of the loan’s
    collateral, or the loan’s market value if the loan is being
    sold. Valuation allowances for pools of loans are established
    based on property types and loan to value risk factors. The
    Company records valuation allowances as investment losses. The
    Company records subsequent adjustments to allowances as
    investment gains (losses).

Agricultural Mortgage Loans.

The Company
    diversifies its agricultural mortgage loans by both geographic
    region and product type.

Of the $10.5 billion of agricultural mortgage loans
    outstanding at December 31, 2007, 58%, were subject to rate
    resets prior to maturity. A substantial portion of these loans
    has been successfully renegotiated and remain outstanding to
    maturity. The process and policies for monitoring the
    agricultural mortgage loans and classifying them by performance
    status are generally the same as those for the commercial loans.

Real
    Estate Holdings

The Company’s real estate holdings consist of commercial
    properties located primarily in the United States. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of the
    Company’s real estate, real estate joint ventures and real
    estate held-for-sale was $6.8 billion and
    $5.0 billion, respectively, or 2.0% and 1.5%, of total cash
    and invested assets, respectively. The carrying value of real
    estate is stated at depreciated cost net of impairments and
    valuation allowances. The carrying value of real estate joint
    ventures is stated at the Company’s equity in the real
    estate joint ventures net of impairments and valuation
    allowances.

The Company’s real estate holdings are primarily located in
    the United States. At December 31, 2007, 22%, 11%, 10% and
    9% of the Company’s real estate holdings were located in
    California, New York, Florida and Texas, respectively.

Certain of the Company’s investments in real estate joint
    ventures meet the definition of a VIE under FIN 46(r). See
    “— Composition of Investment Portfolio
    Results — Variable Interest Entities.”

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company sold its Peter Cooper
    Village and Stuyvesant Town properties located in Manhattan, New
    York for $5.4 billion. The Peter Cooper Village and
    Stuyvesant Town properties together



make up the largest apartment complex in Manhattan, New York
    totaling over 11,000 units, spread over 80 contiguous
    acres. The properties were owned by the Holding Company’s
    subsidiary, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company. The sale
    resulted in a gain of $3 billion, net of income tax, and is
    included in income from discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of income.

In the second quarter of 2005, the Company sold its One Madison
    Avenue and 200 Park Avenue properties in Manhattan, New York for
    $918 million and $1.72 billion, respectively,
    resulting in gains, net of income tax, of $431 million and
    $762 million, respectively, and is included in income from
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    income. In connection with the sale of the 200 Park Avenue
    property, the Company has retained rights to existing signage
    and is leasing space for associates in the property for
    20 years with optional renewal periods through 2205.

Other
    Limited Partnership Interests

The carrying value of other limited partnership interests (which
    primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment
    funds that make private equity investments in companies in the
    United States and overseas) was $6.2 billion and
    $4.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Included within other limited partnership
    interests at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are
    $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of hedge
    funds. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, net investment income from other limited partnership
    interests included $89 million, $98 million and
    $24 million, respectively, related to hedge funds. The
    Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in
    limited partnership interests in which it has more than a minor
    interest, has influence over the partnership’s operating
    and financial policies, but does not have a controlling interest
    and is not the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the cost
    method for minor interest investments and when it has virtually
    no influence over the partnership’s operating and financial
    policies. The Company’s investments in other limited
    partnership interests represented 1.8% and 1.4% of cash and
    invested assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Management anticipates that investment income and the related
    yields on other limited partnership interests may decline during
    2008 due to increased volatility in the equity and credit
    markets during 2007.



Some of the Company’s investments in other limited
    partnership interests meet the definition of a VIE under
    FIN 46(r). See “— Composition of Investment
    Portfolio Results — Variable Interest Entities.”

Other
    Invested Assets

The Company’s other invested assets consisted principally
    of leveraged leases of $2.2 billion and $1.3 billion,
    funds withheld at interest of $4.5 billion and
    $4.0 billion, and standalone derivatives with positive fair
    values and the fair value of embedded derivatives related to
    funds withheld and modified coinsurance contracts of
    $4.1 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The leveraged leases are recorded
    net of non-recourse debt. The Company participates in lease
    transactions, which are diversified by industry, asset type and
    geographic area. The Company regularly reviews residual values
    and writes down residuals to expected values as needed. Funds
    withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by ceding
    companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. For
    agreements written on a modified coinsurance basis and certain
    agreements written on a coinsurance basis, assets supporting the
    reinsured policies equal to the net statutory reserves are
    withheld and continue to be legally owned by the ceding company.
    Interest accrues to these funds withheld at rates defined by the
    treaty terms and may be contractually specified or directly
    related to the investment portfolio. The Company’s other
    invested assets represented 3.7% and 3.2% of cash and invested
    assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company uses a variety of derivatives, including swaps,
    forwards, futures and option contracts, to manage its various
    risks. Additionally, the Company uses derivatives to
    synthetically create investments as permitted by its insurance
    subsidiaries’ Derivatives Use Plans approved by the
    applicable state insurance departments.

    futures are included in financial futures in the preceding
    table. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company owned
    695,485 and 225,000 equity variance swaps, respectively. Fair
    values of equity variance swaps are included in financial
    forwards in the preceding table. At December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Company owned 77,374,937 and 74,864,483 equity
    options, respectively. Fair values of equity options are
    included in options in the preceding table.



Credit Risk.

The Company may be exposed to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to derivative financial instruments. Generally,
    the current credit exposure of the Company’s derivative
    contracts is limited to the fair value at the reporting date.
    The credit exposure of the Company’s derivative
    transactions is represented by the fair value of contracts with
    a net positive fair value at the reporting date.

The Company manages its credit risk related to over-the-counter
    derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was obligated to
    return cash collateral under its control of $833 million
    and $428 million, respectively. This unrestricted cash
    collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents and the
    obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral
    under securities loaned and other transactions in the
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Company had also accepted collateral consisting of
    various securities with a fair market value of $678 million
    and $453 million, respectively, which are held in separate
    custodial accounts. The Company is permitted by contract to sell
    or repledge this collateral, but as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, none of the collateral had been sold or repledged.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company provided
    collateral of $162 million and $80 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities in
    the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has
    exchange traded futures, which require the pledging of
    collateral. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    pledged collateral of $167 million and $105 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities.
    The counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or repledge
    this collateral.

    assets would have been reflected on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet had the Company consolidated the VIE
    from the date of its initial investment in the entity.



Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in a securities lending program whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity and
    equity securities, are loaned to third parties, primarily major
    brokerage firms. The Company requires a minimum of 102% of the
    fair value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained
    as collateral for the loans. Securities with a cost or amortized
    cost of $41.1 billion and $43.3 billion and an
    estimated fair value of $42.1 billion and
    $44.1 billion were on loan under the program at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Securities loaned
    under such transactions may be sold or repledged by the
    transferee. The Company was liable for cash collateral under its
    control of $43.3 billion and $45.4 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Security
    collateral of $40 million and $100 million on deposit
    from customers in connection with the securities lending
    transactions at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    may not be sold or repledged and is not reflected in the
    consolidated financial statements.

Separate
    Accounts

The Company held $160.2 billion and $144.4 billion in
    separate accounts, for which the Company does not bear
    investment risk, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company manages each separate account’s
    assets in accordance with the prescribed investment policy that
    applies to that specific separate account. The Company
    establishes separate accounts on a single client and
    multi-client commingled basis in compliance with insurance laws.
    Effective with the adoption of

SOP 03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
    Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
    Accounts

, on January 1, 2004, the Company reported
    separately, as assets and liabilities, investments held in
    separate accounts and liabilities of the separate accounts if:

•

such separate accounts are legally recognized;

•

assets supporting the contract liabilities are legally insulated
    from the Company’s general account liabilities;

•

investments are directed by the contractholder; and

•

all investment performance, net of contract fees and
    assessments, is passed through to the contractholder.

The Company reports separate account assets meeting such
    criteria at their fair value. Investment performance (including
    investment income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in
    unrealized gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts
    credited to contractholders of such separate accounts are offset
    within the same line in the consolidated statements of income.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges. Separate accounts not



meeting the above criteria are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company must effectively manage, measure and monitor the
    market risk associated with its invested assets and interest
    rate sensitive insurance contracts. It has developed an
    integrated process for managing risk, which it conducts through
    its Corporate Risk Management Department, ALM Committees and
    additional specialists at the business segment level. The
    Company has established and implemented comprehensive policies
    and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level
    to minimize the effects of potential market volatility.

The Company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate,
    equity market and foreign currency exchange risks. As a result
    of that analysis, the Company has determined that the fair value
    of its interest rate sensitive invested assets is materially
    exposed to changes in interest rates. The equity and foreign
    currency portfolios do not expose the Company to material market
    risks (as described below).

MetLife generally uses option adjusted duration to manage
    interest rate risk and the methods and assumptions used are
    generally consistent with those used by the Company in 2006. The
    Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models,
    including multi-scenario cash flow projection models that
    forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting
    investments, including derivative instruments. The Company uses
    a variety of strategies to manage interest rate, equity market,
    and foreign currency exchange risk, including the use of
    derivative instruments.

Market
    Risk Exposures

The Company has exposure to market risk through its insurance
    operations and investment activities. For purposes of this
    disclosure, “market risk” is defined as the risk of
    loss resulting from changes in interest rates, equity market
    prices and foreign currency exchange rates.

Interest Rates.

The Company’s exposure to
    interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of
    fixed maturity securities, as well as its interest rate
    sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities include
    U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by
    government agencies, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed
    securities, all of which are mainly exposed to changes in
    medium- and long-term treasury rates. The interest rate
    sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include
    GICs and annuities, which have the same type of interest rate
    exposure (medium- and long-term treasury rates) as fixed
    maturity securities. The Company employs product design, pricing
    and asset/liability management strategies to reduce the adverse
    effects of interest rate movements. Product design and pricing
    strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions
    on withdrawals in some products. Asset/liability management
    strategies include the use of derivatives, the purchase of
    securities structured to protect against prepayments, prepayment
    restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent
    monitoring of the pricing of the Company’s products in
    order to better match the duration of the assets and the
    liabilities they support. See “Risk Factors —
    Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our
    Profitability.”

Equity Market Prices.

The Company’s
    investments in equity securities and equity-based fixed maturity
    securities expose it to changes in equity prices, as do certain
    liabilities that involve long-term guarantees on equity
    performance. It manages this risk on an integrated basis with
    other risks through its asset/liability management strategies.
    The Company also manages equity market price risk through
    industry and issuer diversification, asset allocation techniques
    and the use of derivatives.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.

The
    Company’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from its
    holdings in

non-U.S. dollar

denominated fixed maturity securities, equity securities and
    liabilities, as well as through its investments in foreign
    subsidiaries. The principal currencies that create foreign
    currency exchange rate risk in the Company’s investment
    portfolios are the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the British
    pound. The Company mitigates its fixed maturity securities’
    foreign currency exchange rate risk through the utilization of
    foreign currency swaps and forward contracts. Through its
    investments in foreign subsidiaries, the Company is primarily
    exposed to the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Australian
    dollar, the



Argentinean peso, the South Korean won, the Chilean peso, the
    Taiwanese dollar and the Japanese yen. The Company has matched
    substantially all of its foreign currency liabilities in its
    foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency
    assets, thereby reducing its risk to currency exchange rate
    fluctuation. Selectively, the Company uses U.S. dollar
    assets to support certain long duration foreign currency
    liabilities. Additionally, in some countries, local surplus is
    held entirely or in part in U.S. dollar assets which
    further minimizes exposure to exchange rate fluctuation risk.

Risk
    Management

Corporate Risk Management.

MetLife has
    established several financial and non-financial senior
    management committees as part of its risk management process.
    These committees manage capital and risk positions, approve
    asset/liability management strategies and establish appropriate
    corporate business standards.

MetLife also has a separate Corporate Risk Management
    Department, which is responsible for risk throughout MetLife and
    reports to MetLife’s Chief Financial Officer. The Corporate
    Risk Management Department’s primary responsibilities
    consist of:

•

implementing a Board of Directors-approved corporate risk
    framework, which outlines the Company’s approach for
    managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis;

•

developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring and
    monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk
    framework;

•

establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels;

•

deploying capital on an economic capital basis; and

•

reporting on a periodic basis to the Governance Committee of the
    Holding Company’s Board of Directors and various financial
    and non-financial senior management committees.

Asset/Liability Management.

The Company
    actively manages its assets using an approach that balances
    quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity
    and investment return. The goals of the investment process are
    to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income
    and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets
    and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis.
    The asset/liability management process is the shared
    responsibility of the Portfolio Management Unit, the Financial
    Management and Oversight Asset/Liability Management Unit, and
    the operating business segments under the supervision of the
    various product line specific ALM Committees. The ALM
    Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving target
    portfolios on a periodic basis, establishing investment
    guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the
    asset/liability management process. The portfolio managers and
    asset sector specialists, who have responsibility on a
    day-to-day basis for risk management of their respective
    investing activities, implement the goals and objectives
    established by the ALM Committees.

Each of MetLife’s business segments has an asset/liability
    officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment
    department to monitor investment, product pricing, hedge
    strategy and liability management issues. MetLife establishes
    target asset portfolios for each major insurance product, which
    represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its
    liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. These strategies
    are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics, such
    as effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity,
    liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.

To manage interest rate risk, the Company performs periodic
    projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the
    potential sensitivity of its investments and liabilities to
    interest rate movements. These projections involve evaluating
    the potential gain or loss on most of the Company’s
    in-force business under various increasing and decreasing
    interest rate environments. Department regulations require that
    MetLife perform some of these analyses annually as part of
    MetLife’s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory
    reserves. For several of its legal entities, the Company
    maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for
    the purpose of asset/liability management and the allocation of
    investment income to product lines. For each segment, invested
    assets greater than or equal to the GAAP liabilities less the
    DAC asset and any non-invested assets allocated to the segment
    are maintained, with any excess swept to the surplus segment.
    The operating segments may reflect differences in legal



entity, statutory line of business and any product market
    characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy
    with respect to duration, liquidity or credit quality of the
    invested assets. Certain smaller entities make use of
    unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy
    reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those
    entities. The Company measures relative sensitivities of the
    value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key
    assumptions utilizing Company models. These models reflect
    specific product characteristics and include assumptions based
    on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality
    and interest crediting rates. In addition, these models include
    asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments,
    sinking fund payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage
    prepayments and defaults.

Common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, are
    also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and
    liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the
    duration of liabilities, consideration is given to all
    policyholder guarantees and to how the Company intends to set
    indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or
    dividends. Each asset portfolio has a duration constraint based
    on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that
    portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity
    of available assets, as is the case with certain retirement and
    non-medical health products, the Company may support such
    liabilities with equity investments or curve mismatch strategies.

Hedging Activities.

To reduce interest rate
    risk, MetLife’s risk management strategies incorporate the
    use of various interest rate derivatives to adjust the overall
    duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios
    to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its
    liabilities. Such instruments include financial futures,
    financial forwards, interest rate and credit default swaps,
    caps, floors and options. MetLife also uses foreign currency
    swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated
    fixed income investments.

Risk
    Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis

The Company measures market risk related to its holdings of
    invested assets and other financial instruments, including
    certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts, based on
    changes in interest rates, equity market prices and currency
    exchange rates, utilizing a sensitivity analysis. This analysis
    estimates the potential changes in fair value based on a
    hypothetical 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest
    rates, equity market prices and currency exchange rates. The
    Company believes that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in
    these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the
    near-term. In performing this analysis, the Company used market
    rates at December 31, 2007 to re-price its invested assets
    and other financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis
    separately calculated each of MetLife’s market risk
    exposures (interest rate, equity market price and foreign
    currency exchange rate) related to its trading and non-trading
    invested assets and other financial instruments. The sensitivity
    analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings
    described above. The Company modeled the impact of changes in
    market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested
    assets as follows:

•

the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures
    resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest
    rates;

•

the market value of its equity positions due to a 10% change
    (increase or decrease) in equity prices; and

•

the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of the Company’s
    currency exposures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in
    currency exchange rates.

The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed
    as predictive of the Company’s future financial
    performance. The Company cannot assure that its actual losses in
    any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the
    table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis
    include:

•

the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and
    parameters established in creating the related sensitivity
    analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages;

•

for derivatives that qualify as hedges, the impact on reported
    earnings may be materially different from the change in market
    values;

•

the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and
    liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts; and

•

the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities
    remains unchanged throughout the year.



Accordingly, the Company uses such models as tools and not
    substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate
    risk and asset/liability management personnel. Based on its
    analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or decrease) in
    market rates and prices, MetLife has determined that such a
    change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of
    its interest rate sensitive invested assets. The equity and
    foreign currency portfolios do not expose the Company to
    material market risk.

The table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of
    the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments
    at December 31, 2007. In addition, the potential loss with
    respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the
    Company’s equity price sensitive positions at
    December 31, 2007 is set forth in the table below.

The potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure
    of the Company’s portfolio at December 31, 2007 was:

This quantitative measure of risk has decreased by
    $805 million, or 13%, to $5,170 million at
    December 31, 2007 from $5,975 million at
    December 31, 2006. A decrease in the yield curve has
    decreased our sensitivity by $1.5 billion. This decrease
    was partially offset by $140 million due to increased asset
    size, $270 million due to increased derivative usage and
    $285 million due to duration charges and other.

In addition to the analysis above, as part of its asset
    liability management program, the Company also performs an
    analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates,
    including both insurance liabilities and financial instruments.
    As of December 31, 2007, a hypothetical instantaneous 10%
    decrease in interest rates applied to the Company’s
    liabilities, insurance and associated asset portfolios would
    reduce the fair value of equity by $12 million. Management
    does not expect that this sensitivity would produce a liquidity
    strain on the Company.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedules listed in the Index to Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Schedules. These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
    also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for deferred acquisition costs and for income taxes
    as required by accounting guidance adopted on January 1,
    2007, and changed its method of accounting for defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans as required by accounting
    guidance adopted on December 31, 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report, dated February 28, 2008,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

Business,
    Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), and its subsidiaries, including
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). MetLife
    is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services
    with operations throughout the United States and the regions of
    Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Through its domestic
    and international subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife offers
    life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners insurance,
    retail banking and other financial services to individuals, as
    well as group insurance, reinsurance and retirement &
    savings products and services to corporations and other
    institutions.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of (i) the Holding Company and its subsidiaries;
    (ii) partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company
    has control; and (iii) variable interest entities
    (“VIEs”) for which the Company is deemed to be the
    primary beneficiary. Closed block assets, liabilities, revenues
    and expenses are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular
    item. See Note 9. Intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated.

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments
    in equity securities in which it has more than a 20% interest
    and for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests in which it has more than a minor equity interest or
    more than a minor influence over the joint venture’s or
    partnership’s operations, but does not have a controlling
    interest and is not the primary beneficiary. The Company uses
    the cost method of accounting for investments in real estate
    joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which
    it has a minor equity investment and virtually no influence over
    the joint venture’s or partnership’s operations.

Minority interest related to consolidated entities included in
    other liabilities was $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Certain amounts in the prior year periods’ consolidated
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
    2007 presentation. Such reclassifications include
    $850 million relating to long-term debt reclassified to
    collateral financing arrangements on the consolidated balance
    sheet at December 31, 2006 and the consolidated statement
    of cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006. See
    Note 11 for a description of the transaction. See also
    Note 23 for reclassifications related to discontinued
    operations.

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from Citigroup
    Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”), which is described in
    Note 2. The acquisition was accounted for using the
    purchase method of accounting. Travelers’ assets,
    liabilities and results of operations were included in the
    Company’s results beginning July 1, 2005. The
    accounting policies of Travelers were conformed to those of
    MetLife upon acquisition.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. The most critical estimates include those used in
    determining:

(i)

the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market
    values;

(ii)

investment impairments;

F-7


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(iii)

the recognition of income on certain investments;

(iv)

the application of the consolidation rules to certain
    investments;

(v)

the fair value of and accounting for derivatives;

(vi)

the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy
    acquisition costs (“DAC”) and the establishment and
    amortization of value of business acquired (“VOBA”);

(vii)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

(viii)

the liability for future policyholder benefits;

(ix)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

(x)

accounting for reinsurance transactions;

(xi)

accounting for employee benefit plans; and

(xii)

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

A description of such critical estimates is incorporated within
    the discussion of the related accounting policies which follow.
    The application of purchase accounting requires the use of
    estimation techniques in determining the fair values of assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed — the most
    significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical
    estimates. In applying these policies, management makes
    subjective and complex judgments that frequently require
    estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of
    these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in
    the insurance and financial services industries; others are
    specific to the Company’s businesses and operations. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Investments

The Company’s principal investments are in fixed maturity
    and equity securities, mortgage and consumer loans, policy
    loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnerships, short-term investments, and other invested assets.
    The accounting policies related to each are as follows:

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities.

The
    Company’s fixed maturity and equity securities are
    classified as

available-for-sale,

except for trading securities, and are reported at their
    estimated fair value. Unrealized investment gains and losses on
    these securities are recorded as a separate component of other
    comprehensive income or loss, net of policyholder related
    amounts and deferred income taxes. All security transactions are
    recorded on a trade date basis. Investment gains and losses on
    sales of securities are determined on a specific identification
    basis.

Interest income on fixed maturity securities is recorded when
    earned using an effective yield method giving effect to
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividends
    on equity securities are recorded when declared. These dividends
    and interest income are recorded as part of net investment
    income.

Included within fixed maturity securities are loan-backed
    securities including mortgage-backed and asset-backed
    securities. Amortization of the premium or discount from the
    purchase of these securities considers the estimated timing and
    amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. Actual prepayment
    experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields are
    recalculated when differences arise between the prepayments
    originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and
    currently anticipated. Prepayment assumptions for single class
    and multi-class mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are
    obtained from broker-dealer survey values or internal estimates.
    For credit-sensitive mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities
    and certain prepayment-sensitive securities, the effective yield
    is recalculated on a prospective basis. For all other
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, the effective yield
    is recalculated on a retrospective basis.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for
    impairments in value deemed to be

other-than-temporary

in the period in which the determination is made. These
    impairments are included within net investment gains (losses)
    and the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities
    is reduced accordingly. The Company does not change the revised
    cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on
    management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair
    value. The Company’s review of its fixed maturity and
    equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the
    total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%;
    (ii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for
    less than six months; and (iii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater.

Additionally, management considers a wide range of factors about
    the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions
    and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the
    impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to:
    (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market
    value has been below cost or amortized cost; (ii) the
    potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the
    potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically
    depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for
    impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or
    industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has
    exhausted natural resources; (vi) the Company’s
    ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time
    sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount
    equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost (See also
    Note 3); (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash
    flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and
    (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations
    and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

The Company purchases and receives beneficial interests in
    special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which enhance the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio
    principally by providing equity-based returns on debt
    securities. These investments are generally made through
    structured notes and similar instruments (collectively,
    “Structured Investment Transactions”). The Company has
    not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the
    SPEs and its exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value
    of the beneficial interests in the SPEs. The Company does not
    consolidate such SPEs as it has determined it is not the primary
    beneficiary. These Structured Investment Transactions are
    included in fixed maturity securities and their income is
    generally recognized using the retrospective interest method.
    Impairments of these investments are included in net investment
    gains (losses).

Trading Securities.

The Company’s trading
    securities portfolio, principally consisting of fixed maturity
    and equity securities, supports investment strategies that
    involve the active and frequent purchase and sale of securities
    and the execution of short sale agreements, and supports asset
    and liability matching strategies for certain insurance
    products. Trading securities and short sale agreement
    liabilities are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes
    in fair value recognized in net investment income. Related
    dividends and investment income are also included in net
    investment income.

Securities Lending.

Securities loaned
    transactions are treated as financing arrangements and are
    recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company obtains
    collateral in an amount equal to 102% of the fair value of the
    securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of the
    securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral
    obtained as necessary. Substantially all of the Company’s
    securities loaned transactions are with large brokerage firms.
    Income and expenses associated with securities loaned

F-9


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

transactions are reported as investment income and investment
    expense, respectively, within net investment income.

Mortgage and Consumer Loans.

Mortgage and
    consumer loans are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted
    for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or
    expenses, net of valuation allowances. Interest income is
    accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the
    loan’s contractual interest rate. Amortization of premiums
    and discounts is recorded using the effective yield method.
    Interest income, amortization of premiums and discounts, and
    prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. Loans are
    considered to be impaired when it is probable that, based upon
    current information and events, the Company will be unable to
    collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan
    agreement. Valuation allowances are established for the excess
    carrying value of the loan over the present value of expected
    future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original
    effective interest rate, the value of the loan’s collateral
    if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise
    collateral dependent, or the loan’s market value if the
    loan is being sold. The Company also establishes allowances for
    loan losses when a loss contingency exists for pools of loans
    with similar characteristics, such as mortgage loans based on
    similar property types or loan to value risk factors. A loss
    contingency exists when the likelihood that a future event will
    occur is probable based on past events. Interest income earned
    on impaired loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan
    based on the loan’s contractual interest rate. However,
    interest ceases to be accrued for loans on which interest is
    generally more than 60 days past due

and/or

where
    the collection of interest is not considered probable. Cash
    receipts on such impaired loans are recorded as a reduction of
    the recorded investment. Gains and losses from the sale of loans
    and changes in valuation allowances are reported in net
    investment gains (losses).

Policy Loans.

Policy loans are stated at
    unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is
    recorded as earned using the contractually agreed upon interest
    rate. Generally, interest is capitalized on the policy’s
    anniversary date.

Real Estate.

Real estate

held-for-investment,

including related improvements, is stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
    (typically 20 to 55 years). Rental income is recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.
    The Company classifies a property as

held-for-sale

if it commits to a plan to sell a property within one year and
    actively markets the property in its current condition for a
    price that is reasonable in comparison to its fair value. The
    Company classifies the results of operations and the gain or
    loss on sale of a property that either has been disposed of or
    classified as

held-for-sale

as discontinued operations, if the ongoing operations of the
    property will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
    Company and if the Company will not have any significant
    continuing involvement in the operations of the property after
    the sale. Real estate

held-for-sale

is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less
    expected disposition costs. Real estate is not depreciated while
    it is classified as

held-for-sale.

The Company periodically reviews its properties

held-for-investment

for impairment and tests properties for recoverability whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
    of the asset may not be recoverable and the carrying value of
    the property exceeds its fair value. Properties whose carrying
    values are greater than their undiscounted cash flows are
    written down to their fair value, with the impairment loss
    included in net investment gains (losses). Impairment losses are
    based upon the estimated fair value of real estate, which is
    generally computed using the present value of expected future
    cash flows from the real estate discounted at a rate
    commensurate with the underlying risks. Real estate acquired
    upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans
    is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the carrying
    value of the mortgage loan at the date of foreclosure.

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership
    Interests.

The Company uses the equity method of
    accounting for investments in real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests in which it has more than a
    minor equity interest or more than a minor influence over the
    joint ventures or

F-10


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

partnership’s operations, but does not have a controlling
    interest and is not the primary beneficiary. The Company uses
    the cost method of accounting for investments in real estate
    joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which
    it has a minor equity investment and virtually no influence over
    the joint ventures or the partnership’s operations. In
    addition to the investees performing regular evaluations for the
    impairment of underlying investments, the Company routinely
    evaluates its investments in real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnerships for impairments. For its cost method
    investments, the Company follows an impairment analysis which is
    similar to the process followed for its fixed maturity and
    equity securities as described previously. For equity method
    investees, the Company considers financial and other information
    provided by the investee, other known information and inherent
    risks in the underlying investments, as well as future capital
    commitments, in determining whether an impairment has occurred.
    When an

other-than-temporary

impairment is deemed to have occurred, the Company records a
    realized capital loss within net investment gains (losses) to
    record the investment at its fair value.

Short-term Investments.

Short-term investments
    include investments with remaining maturities of one year or
    less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition
    and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Other Invested Assets.

Other invested assets
    consist principally of leveraged leases and funds withheld at
    interest. Leveraged leases are recorded net of non-recourse
    debt. The Company participates in lease transactions which are
    diversified by industry, asset type and geographic area. The
    Company recognizes income on the leveraged leases by applying
    the leveraged lease’s estimated rate of return to the net
    investment in the lease. The Company regularly reviews residual
    values and impairs them to expected values as needed.

Funds withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by
    ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. For
    agreements written on a modified coinsurance basis and certain
    agreements written on a coinsurance basis, assets supporting the
    reinsured policies, and equal to the net statutory reserves, are
    withheld and continue to be legally owned by the ceding
    companies. The Company records a funds withheld receivable
    rather than the underlying investments. The Company recognizes
    interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the treaty terms
    which may be contractually specified or directly related to the
    investment portfolio and records it in net investment income.

Other invested assets also include stand-alone derivatives with
    positive fair values and the fair value of embedded derivatives
    related to funds withheld and modified coinsurance contracts.

Estimates and Uncertainties.

The
    Company’s investments are exposed to three primary sources
    of risk: credit, interest rate and market valuation. The
    financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks,
    are those associated with the recognition of impairments, the
    recognition of income on certain investments, and the
    determination of fair values.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments,
    as applicable, are described previously by investment type. The
    determination of such allowances and impairments is highly
    subjective and is based upon the Company’s periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly
    and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations
    as such evaluations are revised.

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain investment transactions,
    trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market conditions,
    which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be
    earned.

The fair values of publicly held fixed maturity securities and
    publicly held equity securities are based on quoted market
    prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However,
    in cases where quoted market prices are not available, such as
    for private fixed maturity securities, fair values are estimated
    using present

F-11


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

value or valuation techniques. The determination of fair values
    is based on: (i) valuation methodologies;
    (ii) securities the Company deems to be comparable; and
    (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market information and
    judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of
    the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the
    credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors
    considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate,
    maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
    requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, and
    quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of
    different methodologies and assumptions may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Additionally, when the Company enters into certain structured
    investment transactions, real estate joint ventures and other
    limited partnerships for which the Company may be deemed to be
    the primary beneficiary under Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46(r),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — An Interpretation of ARB No. 51

, it may
    be required to consolidate such investments. The accounting
    rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are
    complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and
    obligations associated with each party involved in the entity,
    an estimate of the entity’s expected losses and expected
    residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each
    party.

The use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the
    determination of the fair value of investments, the timing and
    amount of impairments, the recognition of income, or
    consolidation of investments may have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived
    from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other
    financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or
    contracted in the

over-the-counter

market. The Company uses a variety of derivatives, including
    swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts, to manage the
    risk associated with variability in cash flows or changes in
    fair values related to the Company’s financial instruments.
    The Company also uses derivative instruments to hedge its
    currency exposure associated with net investments in certain
    foreign operations. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit
    derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to synthetically
    replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily
    available in the cash market. The Company also purchases certain
    securities, issues certain insurance policies and investment
    contracts and engages in certain reinsurance contracts that have
    embedded derivatives.

Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet either as assets within other
    invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at
    fair value as determined by quoted market prices or through the
    use of pricing models. The determination of fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on valuation
    methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate under the
    circumstances. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes
    in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial
    indices, credit spreads, market volatility, and liquidity.
    Values can also be affected by changes in estimates and
    assumptions used in pricing models. Such assumptions include
    estimates of volatility, interest rates, foreign currency
    exchange rates, other financial indices and credit ratings.
    Essential to the analysis of the fair value is risk of
    counterparty default. The use of different assumptions may have
    a material effect on the estimated derivative fair value
    amounts, as well as the amount of reported net income.

If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its
    use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting,
    changes in the fair value of the derivative are generally
    reported in net investment gains (losses) except for those
    (i) in policyholder benefits and claims for economic hedges
    of liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company, and (ii) in net investment income
    for economic hedges of equity method investments in joint
    ventures, or for all derivatives held in relation to the trading
    portfolios. The fluctuations in fair

value of derivatives which have not been designated for hedge
    accounting can result in significant volatility in net income.

To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging
    relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management
    objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction,
    as well as its designation of the hedge as either (i) a
    hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an
    unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value hedge”);
    (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the
    variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
    recognized asset or liability (“cash flow hedge”); or
    (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
    In this documentation, the Company sets forth how the hedging
    instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to
    the hedged item and sets forth the method that will be used to
    retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging
    instrument’s effectiveness and the method which will be
    used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a
    hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in
    offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge
    effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically
    throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship.
    Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of
    ineffectiveness are also subject to interpretation and
    estimation and different interpretations or estimates may have a
    material effect on the amount reported in net income.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under these accounting standards. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported.

Under a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the
    hedging derivative, including amounts measured as
    ineffectiveness, and changes in the fair value of the hedged
    item related to the designated risk being hedged, are reported
    within net investment gains (losses). The fair values of the
    hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals that are
    separately reported in the consolidated statement of income
    within interest income or interest expense to match the location
    of the hedged item.

Under a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the
    hedging derivative measured as effective are reported within
    other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity, and the deferred gains or losses on
    the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statement
    of income when the Company’s earnings are affected by the
    variability in cash flows of the hedged item. Changes in the
    fair value of the hedging instrument measured as ineffectiveness
    are reported within net investment gains (losses). The fair
    values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals
    that are separately reported in the consolidated statement of
    income within interest income or interest expense to match the
    location of the hedged item.

In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes
    in the fair value of the hedging derivative that are measured as
    effective are reported within other comprehensive income (loss)
    consistent with the translation adjustment for the hedged net
    investment in the foreign operation. Changes in the fair value
    of the hedging instrument measured as ineffectiveness are
    reported within net investment gains (losses).

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
    (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer
    highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash
    flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative expires, is
    sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer
    probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur;
    (iv) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the
    definition of a firm commitment; or (v) the derivative is
    de-designated as a hedging instrument.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined
    that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting
    changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, the
    derivative continues to be carried on the consolidated balance
    sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized
    currently in net investment gains

F-13

    Inc.

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(losses). The carrying value of the hedged recognized asset or
    liability under a fair value hedge is no longer adjusted for
    changes in its fair value due to the hedged risk, and the
    cumulative adjustment to its carrying value is amortized into
    income over the remaining life of the hedged item. Provided the
    hedged forecasted transaction is still probable of occurrence,
    the changes in fair value of derivatives recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to discontinued cash flow
    hedges are released into the consolidated statement of income
    when the Company’s earnings are affected by the variability
    in cash flows of the hedged item.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer
    probable that the forecasted transactions will occur by the end
    of the specified time period or the hedged item no longer meets
    the definition of a firm commitment, the derivative continues to
    be carried on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value,
    with changes in fair value recognized currently in net
    investment gains (losses). Any asset or liability associated
    with a recognized firm commitment is derecognized from the
    consolidated balance sheet, and recorded currently in net
    investment gains (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a
    derivative recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)
    pursuant to the cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction are
    recognized immediately in net investment gains (losses).

In all other situations in which hedge accounting is
    discontinued, the derivative is carried at its fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheet, with changes in its fair value
    recognized in the current period as net investment gains
    (losses).

The Company is also a party to financial instruments that
    contain terms which are deemed to be embedded derivatives. The
    Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to
    determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. If the
    instrument would not be accounted for in its entirety at fair
    value and it is determined that the terms of the embedded
    derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic
    characteristics of the host contract, and that a separate
    instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative
    instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host
    contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative. Such
    embedded derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance
    sheet at fair value with the host contract and changes in their
    fair value are reported currently in net investment gains
    (losses). If the Company is unable to properly identify and
    measure an embedded derivative for separation from its host
    contract, the entire contract is carried on the balance sheet at
    fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the current
    period in net investment gains (losses). Additionally, the
    Company may elect to carry an entire contract on the balance
    sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in
    the current period in net investment gains (losses) if that
    contract contains an embedded derivative that requires
    bifurcation. There is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring
    bifurcation may not be identified and reported at fair value in
    the consolidated financial statements and that their related
    changes in fair value could materially affect reported net
    income.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
    with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less
    at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Property,
    Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer
    Software

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are
    included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using
    either the straight-line or

sum-of-the-years-digits

method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as
    appropriate. The estimated life for company occupied real estate
    property is generally 40 years. Estimated lives generally
    range from five to ten years for leasehold improvements and
    three to seven years for all other property and equipment. The
    cost basis of the property, equipment and leasehold improvements
    was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Accumulated depreciation and
    amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements
    was $828 million and $721 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Related depreciation and
    amortization

expense was $136 million, $129 million and
    $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Computer software, which is included in other assets, is stated
    at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software
    costs, as well as certain internal and external costs incurred
    to develop internal-use computer software during the application
    development stage, are capitalized. Such costs are amortized
    generally over a four-year period using the straight-line
    method. The cost basis of computer software was
    $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
    capitalized software was $876 million and $752 million
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Related
    amortization expense was $126 million, $112 million
    and $111 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issue expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in a
    life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of
    the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right
    to receive future cash flows from the business in-force at the
    acquisition date. VOBA is based on actuarially determined
    projections, by each block of business, of future policy and
    contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate
    account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment
    returns and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased
    business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC
    and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the
    related business. DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial
    statements for reporting purposes.

DAC for property and casualty insurance contracts, which is
    primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance or investment-type contracts are
    amortized in proportion to gross premiums, gross margins or
    gross profits, depending on the type of contract as described
    below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, non-medical health
    insurance, and traditional group life insurance) over the entire
    premium paying period in proportion to the present value of
    actual historic and expected future gross premiums. The present
    value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement
    of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity,
    persistency, and investment returns at policy issuance, or
    policy acquisition, as it relates to VOBA, that include
    provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the
    assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit
    liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy
    issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed
    to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a
    premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy
    issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium
    volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties, and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts (dividend paying
    traditional contracts within the closed block) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency, and other factor
    changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely
    to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization.
    Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross
    margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the
    actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross
    margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re-

F-15

    Statements — (Continued)

estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to
    current operations. When actual gross margins exceed those
    previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will
    increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The
    opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below
    the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period,
    the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force,
    which impacts expected future gross margins.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future
    gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of
    the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency,
    interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of
    any hedges used, and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that
    investment returns, expenses, and persistency are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that
    period. When the actual gross profits change from previously
    estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA
    amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge
    or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits
    exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are
    below the previously estimated gross profits. Each reporting
    period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business
    remaining in-force, which impacts expected future gross profits.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period. Returns that are higher than the Company’s
    long-term expectation produce higher account balances, which
    increases the Company’s future fee expectations and
    decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death
    benefit guarantees, resulting in higher expected future gross
    profits. The opposite result occurs when returns are lower than
    the Company’s long-term expectation. The Company’s
    practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from
    returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation
    in equity markets is not changed by short-term market
    fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim
    deviations are expected. The Company monitors these changes and
    only changes the assumption when its long-term expectation
    changes.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation
    of estimated gross margins and profits which may have
    significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Prior to 2007, DAC related to any internally replaced contract
    was generally expensed at the date of replacement. As described
    more fully in “Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements”, effective January 1, 2007, the
    Company adopted Statement of Position (“SOP”)

05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

(“SOP 05-1”).

Under

SOP 05-1,

an internal replacement is defined as a modification in product
    benefits, features, rights or coverages that occur by the
    exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment,
    endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by election or coverage
    within a contract. If the modification substantially changes the
    contract, the DAC is written off immediately through income and
    any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement
    contract are deferred. If the modification does not
    substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the
    original contract will continue and any acquisition costs
    associated with the related modification are expensed.

Sales
    Inducements

The Company has two different types of sales inducements which
    are included in other assets: (i) the policyholder receives
    a bonus whereby the policyholder’s initial account balance
    is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the
    customer’s deposit; and (ii) the policyholder receives
    a higher interest rate using a dollar cost averaging method than
    would have been received based on the normal general account
    interest rate credited. The Company defers sales inducements and
    amortizes them over the life of the policy using the same
    methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
    acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment
    at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances,
    such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that
    there may be justification for conducting an interim test.
    Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of
    goodwill impairment testing, goodwill within
    Corporate & Other is allocated to reporting units
    within the Company’s business segments. If the carrying
    value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair
    value, the excess is recognized as an impairment and recorded as
    a charge against net income. The fair values of the reporting
    units are determined using a market multiple, a discounted cash
    flow model, or a cost approach. The critical estimates necessary
    in determining fair value are projected earnings, comparative
    market multiples and the discount rate.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits and Policyholder Account
    Balances

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value
    of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established
    based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with
    GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions
    used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy
    benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal,
    retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations,
    investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent
    events as appropriate to the respective product type. Utilizing
    these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of
    business basis.

Future policy benefit liabilities for participating traditional
    life insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of
    (i) net level premium reserves for death and endowment
    policy benefits (calculated based upon the non-forfeiture
    interest rate, ranging from 3% to 10% for domestic business and
    3% to 10% for international business, and mortality rates
    guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in
    such contracts); and (ii) the liability for terminal
    dividends.

Future policy benefits for non-participating traditional life
    insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of the present
    value of expected future benefit payments and related expenses
    less the present value of expected future net premiums.
    Assumptions as to mortality and persistency are based upon the
    Company’s experience when the basis of the liability is
    established. Interest rates for the aggregate future policy
    benefit liabilities range from 3% to 10% for domestic business
    and 3% to 12% for international business.

Participating business represented approximately 9% and 10% of
    the Company’s life insurance in-force, and 33% and 38% of
    the number of life insurance policies in-force, at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Participating
    policies represented approximately 31% and 30%, 30% and 29%, and
    31% and 30% of gross and net life insurance premiums for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    The percentages indicated are calculated excluding the business
    of the reinsurance segment.

Future policy benefit liabilities for individual and group
    traditional fixed annuities after annuitization are equal to the
    present value of expected future payments. Interest rates used
    in establishing such liabilities range from 3% to 11% for
    domestic business and 4% to 10% for international business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for non-medical health
    insurance are calculated using the net level premium method and
    assumptions as to future morbidity, withdrawals and interest,
    which provide a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rates
    used in establishing such liabilities range from 3% to 7% for
    domestic business and 3% to 10% for international business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest. Interest rates used in establishing such liabilities
    range from 3% to 8% for domestic business and 2% to 10% for
    international business.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon
    the Company’s historical experience and other actuarial
    assumptions that consider the effects of current developments,
    anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for
    anticipated salvage and subrogation. The effects of changes in
    such estimated liabilities are included in the results of
    operations in the period in which the changes occur.

The Company establishes future policy benefit liabilities for
    minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain
    annuity contracts and secondary and

paid-up

guarantees relating to certain life policies as follows:

•

Annuity guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”)
    liabilities are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. The Company regularly
    evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability
    balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if
    actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier
    assumptions should be revised. The assumptions used in
    estimating the GMDB liabilities are consistent with those used
    for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability
    and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and
    volatility are consistent with the historical experience of the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    (“S&P”). The benefits used in calculating the
    liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a
    range of scenarios.

•

Guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of the income
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance at any
    future date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably
    over the accumulation period based on total expected
    assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used and
    adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge
    or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other
    evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
    The assumptions used for estimating the GMIB liabilities are
    consistent with those used for estimating the GMDB liabilities.
    In addition, the calculation of guaranteed annuitization benefit
    liabilities incorporates an assumption for the percentage of the
    potential annuitizations that may be elected by the
    contractholder.

Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees
    and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the
    additional liability balances, with a related charge or credit
    to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence
    suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. The
    assumptions used in estimating the secondary and

paid-up

guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for
    amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and
    risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility
    for variable products are consistent with historical S&P
    experience. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are
    based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios.

The Company establishes policyholder account balances for
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders relating to certain variable
    annuity products as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit riders (“GMWB”)
    guarantee the contractholder a return of their purchase payment
    via partial withdrawals, even if the account value is reduced to
    zero, provided that the contractholder’s cumulative
    withdrawals in a contract year do not exceed a certain limit.
    The initial guaranteed withdrawal amount is equal to the initial
    benefit base as defined in the contract (typically, the initial
    purchase payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The GMWB is an
    embedded derivative, which is measured at fair value separately
    from the host variable annuity product.

•

Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit riders
    (“GMAB”) provide the contractholder, after a specified
    period of time determined at the time of issuance of the
    variable annuity contract, with a minimum accumulation of their
    purchase payments even if the account value is reduced to zero.
    The initial guaranteed accumulation amount is equal to the
    initial benefit base as defined in the contract (typically, the
    initial purchase payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The
    GMAB is also an embedded derivative, which is measured at fair
    value separately from the host variable annuity product.

•

For both GMWB and GMAB, the initial benefit base is increased by
    additional purchase payments made within a certain time period
    and decreases by benefits paid

and/or

withdrawal amounts. After a specified period of time, the
    benefit base may also increase as a result of an optional reset
    as defined in the contract.

The fair values of the GMWB and GMAB riders are calculated based
    on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to the
    projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract
    charges, over the lives of the contracts, incorporating
    expectations concerning policyholder behavior. In measuring the
    fair value of GMWBs and GMABs, the Company attributes a portion
    of the fees collected from the policyholder equal to the present
    value of expected future guaranteed minimum withdrawal and
    accumulation benefits (at inception). The changes in fair value
    are reported in net investment gains (losses). Any additional
    fees represent “excess” fees and are reported in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees. These
    riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining
    markets, causing an increase in liabilities for future policy
    benefits, negatively affecting net income.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies, guarantees and
    riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities
    result in variances in profit and could result in losses. The
    effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in
    the results of operations in the period in which the changes
    occur.

Policyholder account balances relate to investment-type
    contracts and universal life-type policies. Investment-type
    contracts principally include traditional individual fixed
    annuities in the accumulation phase and non-variable group
    annuity contracts. Policyholder account balances are equal to
    (i) policy account values, which consist of an accumulation
    of gross premium payments; (ii) credited interest, ranging
    from 1% to 17% for domestic business and 1% to 15% for
    international business, less expenses, mortality charges, and
    withdrawals; and (iii) fair value adjustments relating to
    business combinations. Bank deposits are also included in
    policyholder account balances.

Other
    Policyholder Funds

Other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims,
    unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in advance,
    policyholder dividends due and unpaid, and policyholder
    dividends left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care
    and dental claims as well as claims which have been reported but
    not yet settled. The liability for these claims is based on the
    Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims.
    The Company derives estimates for the development of incurred
    but not reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of
    historical patterns of claims and claims development for each
    line of business. The methods used to determine these estimates
    are

F-19

    Inc.

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from this continuous
    review process and differences between estimates and payments
    for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and claims
    expense in the period in which the estimates are changed or
    payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    DAC. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

The Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its
    individual life, group life and health contracts as premium
    received in advance and applies the cash received to premiums
    when due.

Also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Recognition
    of Insurance Revenue and Related Benefits

Premiums related to traditional life and annuity policies with
    life contingencies are recognized as revenues when due from
    policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are provided
    against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated
    lives of the policies. When premiums are due over a
    significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits
    are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into
    operations in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or,
    for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit
    payments.

Premiums related to non-medical health and disability contracts
    are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract
    term.

Deposits related to universal life-type and investment-type
    products are credited to policyholder account balances. Revenues
    from such contracts consist of amounts assessed against
    policyholder account balances for mortality, policy
    administration and surrender charges and are recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the
    period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged
    to operations include interest credited and benefit claims
    incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances.

Premiums related to property and casualty contracts are
    recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of
    premium written relating to the unexpired coverage, are included
    in future policy benefits.

Premiums, policy fees, policyholder benefits and expenses are
    presented net of reinsurance.

Other
    Revenues

Other revenues include advisory fees, broker-dealer commissions
    and fees, and administrative service fees. Such fees and
    commissions are recognized in the period in which services are
    performed. Other revenues also include changes in account value
    relating to corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”).
    Under certain COLI contracts, if the Company reports certain
    unlikely adverse results in its consolidated financial
    statements, withdrawals would not be immediately available and
    would be subject to market value adjustment, which could result
    in a reduction of the account value.

Policyholder
    Dividends

Policyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance
    subsidiaries’ boards of directors. The aggregate amount of
    policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality,
    morbidity and expense experience for the year, as well as
    management’s judgment as to the appropriate level of
    statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.

Income
    Taxes

The Holding Company and its includable life insurance and
    non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated
    U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Code”). Non-includable subsidiaries file either
    separate individual corporate tax returns or separate
    consolidated tax returns.

The Company’s accounting for income taxes represents
    management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the
    existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or
    carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax
    jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when
    management determines, based on available information, that it
    is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not
    be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining
    whether valuation allowances should be established as well as
    the amount of such allowances. When making such determination,
    consideration is given to, among other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company may be required to change its provision for income
    taxes in certain circumstances. Examples of such circumstances
    include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is
    challenged by taxing authorities (See also Note 15) or
    when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on
    deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new
    information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation
    allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax
    laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or
    regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income
    tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could
    significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements in the year these changes occur.

As described more fully in “Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements”, the Company adopted FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”) effective January 1, 2007.
    Under FIN 48, the Company determines whether it is
    more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon
    examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any
    part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements.
    A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that
    is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
    settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits due to tax uncertainties
    that do not meet the threshold are included within other
    liabilities and are charged to earnings in the period that such
    determination is made.

The Company classifies interest recognized as interest expense
    and penalties recognized as a component of income tax.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a
    provider and a purchaser of reinsurance for its life and
    property and casualty insurance products.

For each of its reinsurance contracts, the Company determines if
    the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability
    relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable
    accounting standards. The Company reviews

F-21


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

all contractual features, particularly those that may limit the
    amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or
    features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims.

For reinsurance of existing in-force blocks of long-duration
    contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, the
    difference, if any, between the amounts paid (received), and the
    liabilities ceded (assumed) related to the underlying contracts
    is considered the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of
    the contract. The net cost of reinsurance is recorded as an
    adjustment to DAC and recognized as a component of other
    expenses on a basis consistent with the way the acquisition
    costs on the underlying reinsured contracts would be recognized.
    Subsequent amounts paid (received) on the reinsurance of
    in-force blocks, as well as amounts paid (received) related to
    new business, are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded
    (assumed) future policy benefit liabilities are established.

For prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts that
    meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid
    (received) are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded
    (assumed) unearned premiums and are reflected as a component of
    premiums and other receivables (future policy benefits). Such
    amounts are amortized through earned premiums over the remaining
    contract period in proportion to the amount of protection
    provided. For retroactive reinsurance of short-duration
    contracts that meet the criteria of reinsurance accounting,
    amounts paid (received) in excess of (which do not exceed) the
    related insurance liabilities ceded (assumed) are recognized
    immediately as a loss. Any gains on such retroactive contracts
    are deferred and recorded in other liabilities. The gains are
    amortized primarily using the recovery method.

The assumptions used to account for both long and short-duration
    reinsurance contracts are consistent with those used for the
    underlying contracts. Ceded policyholder and contract related
    liabilities, other than those currently due, are reported gross
    on the balance sheet.

Amounts currently recoverable under reinsurance contracts are
    included in premiums and other receivables and amounts currently
    payable are included in other liabilities. Such assets and
    liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts with the same
    reinsurer may be recorded net on the balance sheet, if a right
    of offset exists within the reinsurance contract.

Premiums, fees and policyholder benefits and claims include
    amounts assumed under reinsurance contracts and are net of
    reinsurance ceded.

If the Company determines that a reinsurance contract does not
    expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a
    significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the
    contract using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits
    received are included in other liabilities and deposits made are
    included within other assets. As amounts are paid or received,
    consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or
    liabilities are adjusted. Interest on such deposits is recorded
    as other revenues or other expenses, as appropriate.
    Periodically, the Company evaluates the adequacy of the expected
    payments or recoveries and adjusts the deposit asset or
    liability through other revenues or other expenses, as
    appropriate.

Amounts received from reinsurers for policy administration are
    reported in other revenues.

Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions
    and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of
    the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty
    credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and
    anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned
    assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to
    ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial
    strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using
    criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment
    process discussed previously.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate accounts are established in conformity with insurance
    laws and are generally not chargeable with liabilities that
    arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account
    assets are subject to general account

F-22


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

claims only to the extent the value of such assets exceeds the
    separate account liabilities. The Company reports separately, as
    assets and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts
    and liabilities of the separate accounts if (i) such
    separate accounts are legally recognized; (ii) assets
    supporting the contract liabilities are legally insulated from
    the Company’s general account liabilities;
    (iii) investments are directed by the contractholder; and
    (iv) all investment performance, net of contract fees and
    assessments, is passed through to the contractholder. The
    Company reports separate account assets meeting such criteria at
    their fair value. Investment performance (including investment
    income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in unrealized
    gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts credited to
    contractholders of such separate accounts are offset within the
    same line in the consolidated statements of income.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges. Separate accounts not meeting the above criteria are
    combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees
    and sales representatives. A December 31 measurement date is
    used for all of the Subsidiaries’ defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans.

Pension benefits are provided utilizing either a traditional
    formula or cash balance formula. The traditional formula
    provides benefits based upon years of credited service and
    either final average or career average earnings. The cash
    balance formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which
    credit participants with benefits equal to a percentage of
    eligible pay as well as earnings credits, determined annually
    based upon the average annual rate of interest on

30-year

Treasury securities, for each account balance. As of
    December 31, 2007, virtually all the obligations are
    calculated using the traditional formula.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions

(“SFAS 87”), as amended, established
    the accounting for pension plan obligations. Under SFAS 87,
    the projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested
    and non-vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary
    levels. The accumulated pension benefit obligation
    (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of vested and
    non-vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary
    levels. Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit
    pension plans are determined using a variety of actuarial
    assumptions, from which actual results may vary, as described
    below.

SFAS No. 106,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

(“SFAS 106”), as amended, established the
    accounting for expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) which represents the actuarial present value
    of all other postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents. Unlike for
    pensions, the EPBO is not recorded in the financial statements
    but is used in measuring the periodic expense. The accumulated
    postretirement plan benefit obligations (“APBO”)
    represents the actuarial present value of future other
    postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered
    through a particular date and is the valuation basis upon which
    liabilities are established. The APBO is determined using a
    variety of actuarial assumptions, from which actual results may
    vary, as described below.

F-23


MetLife,
    Inc.

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Prior to December 31, 2006, the funded status of the
    pension and other postretirement plans, which is the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the PBO for pension
    plans and the APBO for other postretirement plans (collectively,
    the “Benefit Obligations”), were offset by the
    unrecognized actuarial gains or losses, prior service cost and
    transition obligations to determine prepaid or accrued benefit
    cost, as applicable. The net amount was recorded as a prepaid or
    accrued benefit cost, as applicable. Further, for pension plans,
    if the ABO exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, that
    excess was recorded as an additional minimum pension liability
    with a corresponding intangible asset. Recognition of the
    intangible asset was limited to the amount of any unrecognized
    prior service cost. Any additional minimum pension liability in
    excess of the allowable intangible asset was charged, net of
    income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive income.

As described more fully in “Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements”, effective December 31, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and SFAS No. 132(r)

(“SFAS 158”). Effective with the adoption of
    SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, the Company recognizes
    the funded status of the Benefit Obligations for each of its
    plans on the consolidated balance sheet. The actuarial gains or
    losses, prior service costs and credits, and the remaining net
    transition asset or obligation that had not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit costs as of December 31, 2006 are now
    charged, net of income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive
    income. Additionally, these changes eliminated the additional
    minimum pension liability provisions of SFAS 87.

Net periodic benefit cost is determined using management
    estimates and actuarial assumptions to derive service cost,
    interest cost, and expected return on plan assets for a
    particular year. Net periodic benefit cost also includes the
    applicable amortization of any prior service cost (credit)
    arising from the increase (decrease) in prior years’
    benefit costs due to plan amendments or initiation of new plans.
    These costs are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over
    the expected service years of employees whose benefits are
    affected by such plan amendments. Actual experience related to
    plan assets

and/or

the
    benefit obligations may differ from that originally assumed when
    determining net periodic benefit cost for a particular period,
    resulting in gains or losses. To the extent such aggregate gains
    or losses exceed 10 percent of the greater of the benefit
    obligations or the market-related asset value of the plans, they
    are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the expected
    service years of employees expected to receive benefits under
    the plans.

The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. Management,
    in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm,
    determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors
    such as historical performance of the plan and its assets,
    currently available market and industry data, and expected
    benefit payout streams. The assumptions used may differ
    materially from actual results due to, among other factors,
    changing market and economic conditions and changes in
    participant demographics. These differences may have a
    significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and liquidity.

The Subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution savings and
    investment plans (“SIP”) for substantially all
    employees under which a portion of employee contributions are
    matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll
    period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost
    for current matching contributions. As all contributions are
    transferred currently as earned to the SIP trust, no liability
    for matching contributions is recognized in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation grants prior to January 1, 2003
    were accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed
    by Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related interpretations.
    Compensation expense, if any, was recorded based upon the excess
    of the quoted market price at grant date over the amount the
    employee was required to pay to acquire the stock. Under the

F-24


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

provisions of APB 25, there was no compensation expense
    resulting from the issuance of stock options as the exercise
    price was equivalent to the fair market value at the date of
    grant. Compensation expense was recognized under the Long-Term
    Performance Compensation Plan (“LTPCP”), as described
    more fully in Note 18.

Stock-based awards granted after December 31, 2002 but
    prior to January 1, 2006 were accounted for on a
    prospective basis using the fair value accounting method
    prescribed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”), as
    amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

(“SFAS 148”). The fair value method of
    SFAS 123 required compensation expense to be measured based
    on the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant or award
    date. Stock-based compensation was accrued over the vesting
    period of the grant or award, including grants or awards to
    retirement-eligible employees. As required by SFAS 148, the
    Company discloses the pro forma impact as if the stock options
    granted prior to January 1, 2003 had been accounted for
    using the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 rather than the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25. See Note 18.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, using the
    modified prospective transition method, SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(r)”), which replaces SFAS 123
    and supersedes APB 25. The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not
    have a significant impact on the Company’s financial
    position or results of operations. SFAS 123(r) requires
    that the cost of all stock-based transactions be measured at
    fair value and recognized over the period during which a grantee
    is required to provide goods or services in exchange for the
    award. Although the terms of the Company’s stock-based
    plans do not accelerate vesting upon retirement, or the
    attainment of retirement eligibility, the requisite service
    period subsequent to attaining such eligibility is considered
    nonsubstantive. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation
    expense related to stock-based awards over the shorter of the
    requisite service period or the period to attainment of
    retirement eligibility. SFAS 123(r) also requires an
    estimation of future forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    incorporated into the determination of compensation expense when
    recognizing expense over the requisite service period.

Foreign
    Currency

Balance sheet accounts of foreign operations are translated at
    the exchange rates in effect at each year-end and income and
    expense accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange
    prevailing during the year. The local currencies of foreign
    operations generally are the functional currencies unless the
    local economy is highly inflationary. Translation adjustments
    are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income
    or loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
    reported as net investment gains (losses) in the period in which
    they occur.

Discontinued
    Operations

The results of operations of a component of the Company that
    either has been disposed of or is classified as

held-for-sale

are reported in discontinued operations if the operations and
    cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from
    the ongoing operations of the Company as a result of the
    disposal transaction and the Company will not have any
    significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
    component after the disposal transaction.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed based on the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period. The difference between the number of shares assumed
    issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the
    dilutive shares. Diluted earnings per common share include the
    dilutive effect of the assumed: (i) exercise or issuance of
    stock-based awards using the treasury stock method;
    (ii) settlement of stock purchase contracts underlying
    common equity units using the treasury stock method; and
    (iii) settlement of accelerated common stock repurchase
    contract. Under the treasury stock method, exercise or issuance

based awards and settlement of the stock purchase contracts
    underlying common equity units is assumed to occur with the
    proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market
    price for the period. See Notes 13, 18 and 20.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews
    relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation,
    regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies
    to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of
    the Company’s litigation and regulatory investigations, or
    the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts
    recorded could have a material effect upon the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Income
    Taxes

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48.
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    tax recognized in a company’s financial statements.
    FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is
    “more likely than not” that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities
    before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial
    statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
    measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties,
    along with any related interest and penalties. Previously
    recorded income tax benefits that no longer meet this standard
    are required to be charged to earnings in the period that such
    determination is made.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized a $52 million increase in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, a $4 million decrease in the
    interest liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and a
    corresponding reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of
    retained earnings of $37 million, net of $11 million
    of minority interest. See also Note 15.

Insurance
    Contracts

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted

SOP 05-1

which provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises
    for DAC on internal replacements of insurance and investment
    contracts other than those specifically described in
    SFAS 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.

SOP 05-1

defines an internal replacement and is effective for internal
    replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. In addition, in February 2007, the
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) issued related Technical Practice Aids
    (“TPAs”) to provide further clarification of

SOP 05-1.

The TPAs became effective concurrently with the adoption of

SOP 05-1.

As a result of the adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs, if an internal replacement modification
    substantially changes a contract, then the DAC is written off
    immediately through income and any new deferrable costs
    associated with the new replacement are deferred. If a contract
    modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC
    amortization on the original contract will continue and any
    acquisition costs associated with the related modification are
    immediately expensed.

The adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs resulted in a reduction to DAC and VOBA on
    January 1, 2007 and an acceleration of the amortization
    period relating primarily to the Company’s group life and
    health insurance contracts that contain certain rate reset
    provisions. Prior to the adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts was amortized over the expected renewable
    life of the contract. Upon adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts is to

F-26


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

be amortized over the rate reset period. The impact as of
    January 1, 2007 was a cumulative effect adjustment of
    $292 million, net of income tax of $161 million, which
    was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 158. The pronouncement revises financial reporting
    standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans by requiring the:

(i)

recognition in the statement of financial position of the funded
    status of defined benefit plans measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation for
    pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation for other postretirement plans;

(ii)

recognition as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net of income tax, those amounts of actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and net asset
    or obligation at transition that have not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit costs as of the end of the year of adoption;

(iii)

recognition of subsequent changes in funded status as a
    component of other comprehensive income;

(iv)

measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations as of the
    date of the statement of financial position; and

(v)

disclosure of additional information about the effects on the
    employer’s statement of financial position.

The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of
    $744 million, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which is included as a component of total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity. As the Company’s
    measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans is already December 31 there was no impact of
    adoption due to changes in measurement date. See also
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical
    Accounting Estimates” and Note 17.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

As described previously, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123(r) including supplemental
    application guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

(“SAB 107”) — using the modified
    prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, results for prior periods have
    not been restated. SFAS 123(r) requires that the cost of
    all stock-based transactions be measured at fair value and
    recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to
    provide goods or services in exchange for the award. The Company
    had previously adopted the fair value method of accounting for
    stock-based awards as prescribed by SFAS 123 on a
    prospective basis effective January 1, 2003, and prior to
    January 1, 2003, accounted for its stock-based awards to
    employees under the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25.
    The Company did not modify the substantive terms of any existing
    awards prior to adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation
    expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards granted beginning January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r).

The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant
    impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations as all stock-based awards accounted for under the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 had vested prior to
    the adoption date and the Company had adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on

F-27


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

January 1, 2003. As required by SFAS 148, and carried
    forward in the provisions of SFAS 123(r), the Company
    discloses the pro forma impact as if stock-based awards
    accounted for under APB 25 had been accounted for under the fair
    value method in Note 18.

SFAS 123 allowed forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    recognized as a reduction of compensation expense in the period
    in which the forfeiture occurred. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123(r), the Company changed its policy and now
    incorporates an estimate of future forfeitures into the
    determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense
    over the requisite service period. The impact of this change in
    accounting policy was not significant to the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations as of the date of
    adoption.

Additionally, for awards granted after adoption, the Company
    changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock-based
    awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such
    expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the
    period to attainment of retirement-eligibility. The pro forma
    impact of this change in expense recognition policy for
    stock-based compensation is detailed in Note 18.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(r), the Company presented
    tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
    options within operating cash flows in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows. SFAS 123(r) requires tax benefits
    resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options be classified and reported as a
    financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has adopted guidance relating to derivative
    financial instruments as follows:

•

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
    Hybrid Instruments

(“SFAS 155”).
    SFAS 155 amends SFAS 133 and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 allows financial
    instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for
    as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative
    from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole
    instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other
    changes, SFAS 155:

(i)

clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
    are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133;

(ii)

establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
    financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding
    derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that
    contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;

(iii)

clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
    subordination are not embedded derivatives; and

(iv)

amends SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a
    qualifying special-purpose entity (“QSPE”) from
    holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
    beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
    interest.

The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,

Embedded
    Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized
    Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets

(“Issue
    B40”). Issue B40 clarifies that a securitized interest in
    prepayable financial assets is not subject to the conditions in
    paragraph 13(b) of SFAS 133, if it meets both of the
    following criteria: (i) the right to accelerate the
    settlement if the securitized interest cannot be controlled by
    the investor; and (ii) the securitized interest itself does
    not contain an embedded derivative (including an interest
    rate-related derivative) for which bifurcation would be required
    other than an embedded derivative that results solely

F-28


MetLife,
    Inc.

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

from the embedded call options in the underlying financial
    assets. The adoption of Issue B40 did not have a material impact
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B38,

Embedded Derivatives: Evaluation of Net Settlement with
    Respect to the Settlement of a Debt Instrument through Exercise
    of an Embedded Put Option or Call Option

(“Issue
    B38”) and SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B39,

Embedded Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to
    Call Options That Are Exercisable Only by the Debtor

(“Issue B39”). Issue B38 clarifies that the
    potential settlement of a debtor’s obligation to a creditor
    occurring upon exercise of a put or call option meets the net
    settlement criteria of SFAS 133. Issue B39 clarifies that
    an embedded call option, in which the underlying is an interest
    rate or interest rate index, that can accelerate the settlement
    of a debt host financial instrument should not be bifurcated and
    fair valued if the right to accelerate the settlement can be
    exercised only by the debtor (issuer/borrower) and the investor
    will recover substantially all of its initial net investment.
    The adoption of Issues B38 and B39 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Other

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Staff
    Position (“FSP”) Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”)

00-19-2,

Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements

(“FSP

EITF 00-19-2”).

FSP

EITF 00-19-2

specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies.

The adoption of FSP

EITF 00-19-2

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of
    Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction

(“FSP 13-2”).

FSP 13-2

amends SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, to
    require that a lessor review the projected timing of income tax
    cash flows generated by a leveraged lease annually or more
    frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a change in
    timing has occurred or is projected to occur. In addition,

FSP 13-2

requires that the change in the net investment balance resulting
    from the recalculation be recognized as a gain or loss from
    continuing operations in the same line item in which leveraged
    lease income is recognized in the year in which the assumption
    is changed. The adoption of

FSP 13-2

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). Among other requirements,
    SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset
    or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to
    service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract
    in certain situations. The adoption of SFAS 156 did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Effective November 15, 2006, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”).
    SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements
    should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
    year financial statements for purposes of assessing materiality.
    SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using
    both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement
    that, when relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
    considered, is material. SAB 108 permits companies to
    initially apply its provisions by either restating prior
    financial statements or recording a cumulative effect adjustment
    to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2006 with an offsetting adjustment to retained
    earnings for errors that were previously deemed immaterial but
    are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively EITF Issue

No. 05-7,

Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded
    in Debt Instruments and Related Issues

(“EITF 05-7”).

EITF 05-7

provides guidance on whether a modification of conversion
    options embedded in debt results in an extinguishment of that
    debt. In certain situations, companies may change the terms of
    an embedded conversion option as part of a debt modification.
    The EITF concluded that the change in the fair value of an
    embedded conversion option upon modification should be included
    in the analysis of EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

, to determine whether a modification or
    extinguishment has occurred and that a change in the fair value
    of a conversion option should be recognized upon the
    modification as a discount (or premium) associated with the
    debt, and an increase (or decrease) in additional paid-in
    capital. The adoption of

EITF 05-7

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-8,

Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a
    Beneficial Conversion Feature

(“EITF 05-8”).

EITF 05-8

concludes that: (i) the issuance of convertible debt with a
    beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that
    should be accounted for as a temporary difference; and
    (ii) the establishment of the deferred tax liability for
    the basis difference should result in an adjustment to
    additional paid-in capital.

EITF 05-8

was applied retrospectively for all instruments with a
    beneficial conversion feature accounted for in accordance with
    EITF Issue

No. 98-5,

Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios

, and EITF Issue

No. 00-27,

Application of Issue

No. 98-5

to Certain Convertible Instruments.

The adoption of

EITF 05-8

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
    Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
    Statement No. 3

(“SFAS 154”).
    SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior
    periods’ financial statements for a voluntary change in
    accounting principle unless it is deemed impracticable. It also
    requires that a change in the method of depreciation,
    amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets
    be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate rather than
    a change in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS 154
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”).

EITF 04-5

provides a framework for determining whether a general partner
    controls and should consolidate a limited partnership or a
    similar entity in light of certain rights held by the limited
    partners. The consensus also provides additional guidance on
    substantive rights.

EITF 04-5

was effective after June 29, 2005 for all newly formed
    partnerships and for any pre-existing limited partnerships that
    modified their partnership agreements after that date. For all
    other limited partnerships,

EITF 04-5

required adoption by January 1, 2006 through a cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle recorded in opening
    equity or applied retrospectively by adjusting prior period
    financial statements. The adoption of the provisions of

EITF 04-5

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective November 9, 2005, the Company prospectively
    adopted the guidance in FSP

No. FAS 140-2,

Clarification of the Application of Paragraphs 40(b) and
    40(c) of FAS 140

(“FSP 140-2”).

FSP 140-2

clarified certain criteria relating to derivatives and
    beneficial interests when considering whether an entity
    qualifies as a QSPE. Under

FSP 140-2,

the criteria must only be met at the date the QSPE issues
    beneficial interests or when a derivative financial instrument
    needs to be replaced upon the occurrence of a specified event
    outside the control of the transferor. The adoption of

FSP 140-2

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an
    amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

(“SFAS 153”). SFAS 153 amended prior
    guidance to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of
    similar productive assets and replaced it with a general
    exception for

F-30


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
    substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
    the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
    significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of
    SFAS 153 were required to be applied prospectively for
    fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption
    of SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-6,

Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold
    Improvements

(“EITF 05-6”).

EITF 05-6

provides guidance on determining the amortization period for
    leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or
    acquired subsequent to lease inception. As required by

EITF 05-6,

the Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis which
    had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In June 2005, the FASB completed its review of EITF Issue

No. 03-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

(“EITF 03-1”).

EITF 03-1

provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when
    an impairment of debt and marketable equity securities and
    investments accounted for under the cost method should be
    considered

other-than-temporary

and recognized in income.

EITF 03-1

also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures
    for debt and marketable equity securities classified as

available-for-sale

or

held-to-maturity

under SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, that are impaired
    at the balance sheet date but for which an

other-than-temporary

impairment has not been recognized. The FASB decided not to
    provide additional guidance on the meaning of

other-than-temporary

impairment but has issued FSP Nos.

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments

(“FSP 115-1”),

which nullifies the accounting guidance on the determination of
    whether an investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired as set forth in

EITF 03-1.

As required by

FSP 115-1,

the Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis, which
    had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, and has provided the required disclosures.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
    Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of

(“FSP 109-2”).

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”)
    introduced a one-time dividend received deduction on the
    repatriation of certain earnings to a U.S. taxpayer.

FSP 109-2

provides companies additional time beyond the financial
    reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the
    AJCA on their plans to repatriate foreign earnings for purposes
    of applying SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes.

During 2005, the Company recorded a $27 million
    income tax benefit related to the repatriation of foreign
    earnings pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 965 for
    which a U.S. deferred income tax provision had previously
    been recorded. As of January 1, 2006, the repatriation
    provision of the AJCA no longer applies to the Company.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

Fair
    Value

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about
    fair value measurements. Effective January 1, 2008, the
    Company adopted SFAS 157 and applied the provisions of the
    statement prospectively to assets and liabilities measured and
    disclosed at fair value. In addition to new disclosure
    requirements, the adoption of SFAS 157 changes the
    valuation of certain freestanding derivatives by moving from a
    mid to bid pricing convention as well as changing the valuation
    of embedded derivatives associated with annuity contracts. The
    change in valuation of embedded derivatives associated with
    annuity contracts results from the incorporation of risk margins
    and the Company’s own credit standing in their valuation.
    While the Company does not expect such changes in valuation to
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements at January 1, 2008, the addition of risk margins
    and the Company’s own credit spread in the valuation of
    embedded derivatives associated with annuity contracts may
    result in significant volatility in the Company’s
    consolidated net income.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities
    the option to measure most financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value at specified election dates and to
    report related unrealized gains and losses in earnings. The fair
    value option is generally applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is generally an irrevocable election. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company has elected the fair value
    option on fixed maturity securities backing certain pension
    products sold in Brazil. Previously, these fixed maturity
    securities were accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities in accordance with FAS 115. The Company’s
    insurance joint venture in Japan also elected the fair value
    option for its single premium deferred annuities and supporting
    assets. These elections are not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s retained earnings or equity as of
    January 1, 2008.

In June 2007, the AICPA issued

SOP 07-1,

Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide
    Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and
    Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies

(“SOP 07-1”)

. Upon adoption of

SOP 07-1,

the Company must also adopt the provisions of FASB Staff
    Position No. FSP

FIN 46(r)-7,

Application of FASB Interpretation No. 46 to Investment
    Companies

(“FSP

FIN 46(r)-7”),

which permanently exempts investment companies from applying the
    provisions of FIN No. 46(r),

Consolidation of
    Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

, and its
    December 2003 revision (“FIN 46(r)”) to
    investments carried at fair value.

SOP 07-1

provides guidance for determining whether an entity falls within
    the scope of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide

Investment
    Companies

and whether investment company accounting should
    be retained by a parent company upon consolidation of an
    investment company subsidiary or by an equity method investor in
    an investment company. In certain circumstances,

SOP 07-1

precludes retention of specialized accounting for investment
    companies (i.e., fair value accounting), when similar direct
    investments exist in the consolidated group and are measured on
    a basis inconsistent with that applied to investment companies.
    Additionally,

SOP 07-1

precludes retention of specialized accounting for investment
    companies if the reporting entity does not distinguish through
    documented policies the nature and type of investments to be
    held in the investment companies from those made in the
    consolidated group where other accounting guidance is being
    applied. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.
    SOP 7-1-1,

Effective Date of AICPA Statement of Position
    07-1

, which delays indefinitely the effective date of SOP
    07-1. The Company is closely monitoring further FASB
    developments.

In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP

No. FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

(“FSP 39-1”).

FSP 39-1

amends FIN No. 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to
    Certain Contracts

(“FIN 39”), to permit a
    reporting entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the
    right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the
    obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) against fair
    value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed
    with the same counterparty under the same master netting
    arrangement that have been offset in accordance with
    FIN 39.

FSP 39-1

also amends FIN 39 for certain terminology modifications.

FSP 39-1

applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.

FSP 39-1

will be applied retrospectively, unless it is impracticable to
    do so. Upon adoption of

FSP 39-1,

the Company is permitted to change its accounting policy to
    offset or not offset fair value amounts recognized for
    derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. The
    adoption of

FSP 39-1

will not have an impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations — A
    Replacement of FASB Statement No. 141

(“SFAS 141(r)”) and SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”) which are effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008. Under
    SFAS 141(r) and SFAS 160:

•

All business combinations (whether full, partial, or
    “step” acquisitions) result in all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at fair
    value, with limited exceptions.

•

Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred;
    restructuring costs associated with a business combination are
    generally expensed as incurred subsequent to the acquisition
    date.

F-32


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

The fair value of the purchase price, including the issuance of
    equity securities, is determined on the acquisition date.

•

Certain acquired contingent liabilities are recorded at fair
    value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at
    either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under
    existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies.

•

Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income
    tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect
    income tax expense.

•

Noncontrolling interests (formerly known as “minority
    interests”) are valued at fair value at the acquisition
    date and are presented as equity rather than liabilities.

•

When control is attained on previously noncontrolling interests,
    the previously held equity interests are remeasured at fair
    value and a gain or loss is recognized.

•

Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a
    change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.

•

When control is lost in a partial disposition, realized gains or
    losses are recorded on equity ownership sold and the remaining
    ownership interest is remeasured and holding gains or losses are
    recognized.

The pronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008 and apply prospectively to
    business combinations. Presentation and disclosure requirements
    related to noncontrolling interests must be retrospectively
    applied. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS 141(r) on its accounting for future acquisitions and
    the impact of SFAS 160 on its consolidated financial
    statements.

Other

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.

FAS 140-3,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase
    Financing Transactions

(“FSP 140-3”).

FSP 140-3

provides guidance for evaluating whether to account for a
    transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing as a
    single transaction or as two separate transactions.

FSP 140-3

is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company
    is currently evaluating the impact of

FSP FAS 140-3

on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2008, the FASB cleared SFAS 133 Implementation
    Issue E23,

Clarification of the Application of the Shortcut
    Method

(“Issue E23”). Issue E23 amends
    SFAS 133 by permitting interest rate swaps to have a
    non-zero fair value at inception, as long as the difference
    between the transaction price (zero) and the fair value (exit
    price), as defined by SFAS 157, is solely attributable to a
    bid-ask spread. In addition, entities would not be precluded
    from assuming no ineffectiveness in a hedging relationship of
    interest rate risk involving an interest bearing asset or
    liability in situations where the hedged item is not recognized
    for accounting purposes until settlement date as long as the
    period between trade date and settlement date of the hedged item
    is consistent with generally established conventions in the
    marketplace. Issue E23 is effective for hedging relationships
    designated on or after January 1, 2008. The Company does
    not expect the adoption of Issue E23 to have a material impact
    on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified as final the consensus on
    EITF Issue

No. 07-6,

Accounting for the Sale of Real Estate When the Agreement
    Includes a Buy-Sell Clause

(“EITF 07-6”).

EITF 07-6

addresses whether the existence of a buy-sell arrangement would
    preclude partial sales treatment when real estate is sold to a
    jointly owned entity. The consensus concludes that the existence
    of a buy-sell clause does not necessarily preclude partial sale
    treatment under current guidance.

EITF 07-6

applies prospectively to new arrangements entered into and
    assessments on existing transactions performed in fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of

EITF 07-6

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In November 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 109,

Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value through
    Earnings

(“SAB 109”), which amends
    SAB No. 105,

Application of Accounting Principles
    to Loan Commitments

. SAB 109 provides guidance on
    (i) incorporating expected net future cash flows when
    related to the associated servicing of a loan when measuring
    fair value; and (ii) broadening the SEC staff’s view
    that internally-developed intangible assets should not be
    recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative loan
    commitment or to written loan commitments that are accounted for
    at fair value through earnings. Internally-developed intangible
    assets are not considered a component of the related
    instruments. SAB 109 is effective for derivative loan
    commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning
    after December 15, 2007. The adoption of SAB 109 will
    not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

Travelers

On July 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Travelers for $12.1 billion. The results of Travelers’
    operations were included in the Company’s financial
    statements beginning July 1, 2005. As a result of the
    acquisition, management of the Company increased significantly
    the size and scale of the Company’s core insurance and
    annuity products and expanded the Company’s presence in
    both the retirement & savings’ domestic and
    international markets. The distribution agreements executed with
    Citigroup as part of the acquisition provide the Company with
    one of the broadest distribution networks in the industry.

The initial consideration paid in 2005 by the Company for the
    acquisition consisted of $10.9 billion in cash and
    22,436,617 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
    market value of $1.0 billion to Citigroup and
    $100 million in other transaction costs. The Company
    revised the purchase price as a result of the finalization by
    both parties of their review of the June 30, 2005 financial
    statements and final resolution as to the interpretation of the
    provisions of the acquisition agreement which resulted in a
    payment of additional consideration of $115 million by the
    Company to Citigroup in 2006. In addition to cash on-hand, the
    purchase price was financed through the issuance of common stock
    as described previously, debt securities as described in
    Note 10, common equity units as described in Note 13
    and preferred stock as described in Note 18.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
    accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of
    Travelers be measured at their fair values. The net fair value
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed totaled
    $7.8 billion, resulting in goodwill of $4.3 billion,
    of which $1.6 billion is deductible for income tax
    purposes. Further information on goodwill is described in
    Note 6. See Note 5 for the VOBA acquired as part of
    the acquisition and Note 7 for the value of distribution
    agreements (“VODA”) and the value of customer
    relationships acquired (“VOCRA”).

As part of the integration of Travelers’ operations,
    management approved and initiated plans to reduce approximately
    1,000 domestic and international Travelers positions, which was
    completed in December 2006. MetLife initially recorded
    restructuring costs, including severance, relocation and
    outplacement services of Travelers’ employees, as
    liabilities assumed in the purchase business combination of
    $49 million. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the liability for restructuring costs was reduced by
    $4 million and

F-34


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$1 million, respectively, due to a reduction in the
    estimate of severance benefits to be paid to Travelers
    employees. The restructuring costs associated with the Travelers
    acquisition were as follows:

Other
    Acquisitions and Dispositions

On June 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in a joint venture in Hong Kong, MetLife Fubon Limited
    (“MetLife Fubon”), for $56 million in cash,
    resulting in MetLife Fubon becoming a consolidated subsidiary of
    the Company. The transaction was treated as a step acquisition,
    and at June 30, 2007, total assets and liabilities of
    MetLife Fubon of $839 million and $735 million,
    respectively, were included in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet. The Company’s investment for the initial 50%
    interest in MetLife Fubon was $48 million. The Company used
    the equity method of accounting for such investment in MetLife
    Fubon. The Company’s share of the joint venture’s
    results for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was a loss
    of $3 million. The fair value of the assets acquired and
    the liabilities assumed in the step acquisition at June 30,
    2007, was $427 million and $371 million, respectively.
    No additional goodwill was recorded as a part of the step
    acquisition. As a result of this acquisition, additional VOBA
    and VODA of $45 million and $5 million, respectively,
    were recorded and both have a weighted average amortization
    period of 16 years. Further information on VOBA and VODA is
    described in Note 5 and Note 7, respectively.

On June 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its
    Bermuda insurance subsidiary, MetLife International Insurance,
    Ltd. (“MLII”), to a third party for $33 million
    in cash consideration, resulting in a gain upon disposal of
    $3 million, net of income tax. The net assets of MLII at
    disposal were $27 million. A liability of $1 million
    was recorded with respect to a guarantee provided in connection
    with this disposition. Further information on guarantees is
    described in Note 16.

On September 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition
    of CitiStreet Associates, a division of CitiStreet LLC, which is
    primarily involved in the distribution of annuity products and
    retirement plans to the education, healthcare, and

not-for-profit

markets, for $56 million, of which $2 million was
    allocated to goodwill and $54 million to other identifiable
    intangibles, specifically the value of customer relationships
    acquired, which have a weighted average amortization period of
    16 years. CitiStreet Associates was integrated with MetLife
    Resources, a focused distribution channel of MetLife, which is
    dedicated to provide retirement plans and financial services to
    the same markets. Further information on goodwill and VOCRA is
    described in Note 6 and Note 7, respectively.

See Note 23 for information on the disposition of the
    annuities and pension businesses of MetLife Insurance Limited
    (“MetLife Australia”), P.T. Sejahtera
    (“MetLife Indonesia”) and SSRM Holdings, Inc.
    (“SSRM”).

The Company held foreign currency derivatives with notional
    amounts of $9.2 billion and $8.9 billion to hedge the
    exchange rate risk associated with foreign denominated fixed
    maturity securities at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company is not exposed to any significant concentrations of
    credit risk in its equity securities portfolio. The Company is
    exposed to concentrations of credit risk related to
    U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of
    U.S. government corporations and agencies. Additionally, at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had exposure to
    fixed maturity securities backed by sub-prime mortgages with
    estimated fair values of $2.2 billion and
    $3.0 billion, respectively, and unrealized losses of
    $219 million and $5 million, respectively. These
    securities are classified within asset-backed securities in the
    immediately preceding table. At December 31, 2007, 32% have
    been guaranteed by financial guarantors, of which 55% was
    guaranteed by financial guarantors who remain Aaa rated in 2008.
    Overall, at December 31, 2007, $6.7 billion of the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed maturity
    securities were credit enhanced by financial guarantors of which
    $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.7 billion at
    December 31, 2007, are included within state and political
    subdivisions, corporate securities and asset-backed securities,
    respectively, and 80% were guaranteed by financial guarantors
    who remain Aaa rated in 2008.

The Company held fixed maturity securities at estimated fair
    values that were below investment grade or not rated by an
    independent rating agency that totaled $17.7 billion and
    $17.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. These securities had net unrealized gains (losses)
    of ($108) million and $627 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Non-income
    producing fixed maturity securities were $13 million and
    $16 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Net unrealized gains associated with non-income
    producing fixed maturity securities were $12 million and
    $4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As described more fully in Note 1, the Company performs a
    regular evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its investment holdings in accordance with its
    impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such securities
    are other-than-temporarily impaired. One of the criteria which
    the Company considers in its other-than-temporary impairment
    analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of their
    value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized
    cost. The Company’s intent and ability to hold securities
    considers broad portfolio management objectives such as
    asset/liability duration management, issuer and industry segment
    exposures, interest rate views and the overall total return
    focus. In following these portfolio management objectives,
    changes in facts and circumstances that were present in past
    reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell securities that
    were held in prior reporting periods. Decisions to sell are
    based on current conditions or the Company’s need to shift
    the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management objectives
    including liquidity needs or duration targets on asset/liability
    managed portfolios. The Company attempts to anticipate these
    types of changes and if a sale decision has been made on an
    impaired security and that security is not expected to recover
    prior to the expected time of sale, the security will be deemed
    other-than-temporarily impaired in the period that the sale
    decision was made and an other-than-temporary impairment loss
    will be recognized.

Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of the
    securities in accordance with its impairment policy, the cause
    of the decline being principally attributable to the general
    rise in interest rates during the holding period, and the
    Company’s current intent and ability to hold the fixed
    maturity and equity securities with unrealized losses for a
    period of time sufficient for them to recover, the Company has
    concluded that the aforementioned securities are not
    other-than-temporarily impaired.

    fair value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained
    as collateral for the loans. Securities with a cost or amortized
    cost of $41.1 billion and $43.3 billion and an
    estimated fair value of $42.1 billion and
    $44.1 billion were on loan under the program at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Securities loaned
    under such transactions may be sold or repledged by the
    transferee. The Company was liable for cash collateral under its
    control of $43.3 billion and $45.4 billion at

    $7.1 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, consisting primarily of fixed
    maturity and equity securities.

Certain of the Company’s fixed maturity securities are

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, trading securities were
    $779 million and $759 million, respectively, and
    liabilities associated with the short sale agreements in the
    trading securities portfolio, which were included in other
    liabilities, were $107 million and $387 million,
    respectively. The Company had pledged $407 million and
    $614 million of its assets, primarily consisting of trading
    securities, as collateral to secure the liabilities associated
    with the short sale agreements in the trading securities
    portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    interest and dividends earned on trading securities in addition
    to the net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on
    the trading securities and the related short sale agreement
    liabilities included within net investment income totaled
    $50 million, $71 million and $14 million,
    respectively. Included within unrealized gains (losses) on such
    trading securities and short sale agreement liabilities, are
    changes in fair value of ($4) million, $26 million and
    less than $1 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As part of the acquisition of Travelers on July 1, 2005,
    the Company acquired Travelers’ investment in Tribeca
    Citigroup Investments Ltd. (“Tribeca”). Tribeca was a
    feeder fund investment structure whereby the feeder fund invests
    substantially all of its assets in the master fund, Tribeca
    Global Convertible Instruments Ltd. The primary investment
    objective of the master fund is to achieve enhanced
    risk-adjusted return by investing in domestic and foreign
    equities and equity-related securities utilizing such strategies
    as convertible securities arbitrage. At December 31, 2005,
    MetLife was the majority owner of the feeder fund and
    consolidated the fund within its consolidated financial
    statements. Net investment income related to the trading
    activities of Tribeca, which included interest and dividends
    earned on trading securities in addition to the net realized and
    unrealized gains (losses), was $12 million and
    $6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and
    the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2006, MetLife’s ownership
    interests in Tribeca declined to a position whereby Tribeca is
    no longer consolidated and, as of June 30, 2006, was
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The equity
    method investment at December 31, 2006 of $82 million
    was included in other limited partnership interests. Net
    investment income related to the Company’s equity method
    investment in Tribeca was $9 million for the six months
    ended December 31, 2006.

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce
    market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter
    interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets
    and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap,
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate
    interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed
    notional principal amount. These transactions are entered into
    pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date.

The Company also enters into basis swaps to better match the
    cash flows from assets and related liabilities. In a basis swap,
    both legs of the swap are floating with each based on a
    different index. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset
    of the contract and no principal payments are made by either
    party. A single net payment is usually made by one counterparty
    at each due date. Basis swaps are included in interest rate
    swaps in the preceding table.

Interest rate caps and floors are used by the Company primarily
    to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in
    interest rates above a specified level, and against interest
    rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and
    liabilities (duration mismatches), as well as to protect its
    minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest
    rates below a specified level, respectively.

In exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) and equity
    futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a
    specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined
    by the different classes of interest rate and equity securities,
    and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal
    to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts.
    The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated
    futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange.

Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are
    used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of
    assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported
    by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities
    the Company owns or anticipates acquiring, and to hedge against
    changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by
    replicating Treasury or swap curve performance. The value of
    interest rate futures is substantially impacted by changes in
    interest rates and they can be used to modify or hedge existing
    interest rate risk.

Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge
    liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company.

Foreign currency derivatives, including foreign currency swaps,
    foreign currency forwards and currency option contracts, are
    used by the Company to reduce the risk from fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and
    liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also
    uses foreign currency forwards and swaps to hedge the foreign
    currency risk associated with certain of its net investments in
    foreign operations.

In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the
    difference between one currency and another at a forward
    exchange rate calculated by reference to an agreed upon
    principal amount. The principal amount of each currency is
    exchanged at the inception and termination of the currency swap
    by each party.

In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees
    with another party to deliver a specified amount of an
    identified currency at a specified future date. The price is
    agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a
    contract is made in a different currency at the specified future
    date.

The Company enters into currency option contracts that give it
    the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency
    amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a
    limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be
    net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign
    exchange rate and the strike price. Currency option contracts
    are included in options in the preceding table.

Swaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk
    associated with the Company’s long-term liabilities, as
    well as to sell, or monetize, embedded call options in its fixed
    rate liabilities. A swaption is an option to enter into a swap
    with an effective date equal to the exercise date of the
    embedded call and a maturity date equal to the maturity date of
    the underlying liability. The Company receives a premium for
    entering into the swaption. Swaptions are included in options in
    the preceding table.

Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in
    equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the
    equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The
    contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in
    the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. Equity
    index options are included in options in the preceding table.

The Company enters into financial forwards to buy and sell
    securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract
    and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future
    date.

Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company
    agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future,
    based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period.
    Equity variance swaps are included in financial forwards in the
    preceding table.

Swap spread locks are used by the Company to hedge invested
    assets on an economic basis against the risk of changes in
    credit spreads. Swap spread locks are forward starting swaps
    where the Company agrees to pay a coupon based on a
    predetermined reference swap spread in exchange for receiving a
    coupon based on a floating rate. The Company has the option to
    cash settle with the counterparty in lieu of maintaining the
    swap after the effective date. Swap spread locks are included in
    financial forwards in the preceding table.

Certain credit default swaps are used by the Company to hedge
    against credit-related changes in the value of its investments
    and to diversify its credit risk exposure in certain portfolios.
    In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party, at specified intervals, to pay a premium to
    insure credit risk. If a credit event, as defined by the
    contract, occurs, generally the contract will require the swap
    to be settled gross by the delivery of par

    Statements — (Continued)

quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified
    swap notional in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the
    counterparty equal to the par value of the investment
    surrendered.

Credit default swaps are also used to synthetically create
    investments that are either more expensive to acquire or
    otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions
    are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as
    a U.S. Treasury or Agency security. The Company also enters
    into certain credit default swaps held in relation to trading
    portfolios.

A synthetic guaranteed interest contract (“GIC”) is a
    contract that simulates the performance of a traditional GIC
    through the use of financial instruments. Under a synthetic GIC,
    the policyholder owns the underlying assets. The Company
    guarantees a rate return on those assets for a premium.

Total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”) are swaps whereby
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward
    of an asset or a market index and LIBOR, calculated by reference
    to an agreed notional principal amount. No cash is exchanged at
    the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the
    life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These
    transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that
    provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty
    at each due date. TRRs can be used as hedges or to synthetically
    create investments and are included in the other classification
    in the preceding table.

The Company designates and accounts for the following as fair
    value hedges when they have met the requirements of
    SFAS 133: (i) interest rate swaps to convert fixed
    rate investments to floating rate investments; and
    (ii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency
    fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated investments
    and liabilities.

The Company recognized net investment gains (losses)
    representing the ineffective portion of all fair value hedges as
    follows:

All components of each derivative’s gain or loss were

    instances in which the Company discontinued fair value hedge
    accounting due to a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying
    as a fair value hedge.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

The Company designates and accounts for the following as cash
    flow hedges when they have met the requirements of
    SFAS 133: (i) interest rate swaps to convert floating
    rate investments to fixed rate investments; (ii) interest
    rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate
    liabilities; (iii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency
    denominated investments and liabilities; and (iv) financial
    forwards to buy and sell securities.

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    did not recognize any net investment gains (losses) which
    represented the ineffective portion of all cash flow hedges. For
    the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized
    net investment gains (losses) of ($25) million which
    represented the ineffective portion of all cash flow hedges. All
    components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included
    in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In certain instances,
    the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the
    forecasted transactions did not occur on the anticipated date or
    in the additional time period permitted by SFAS 133. The
    net amounts reclassified into net investment losses for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 related to
    such discontinued cash flow hedges were $3 million,
    $3 million and $42 million, respectively. There were
    no hedged forecasted transactions, other than the receipt or
    payment of variable interest payments for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Hedges
    of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency
    swaps, options and non-derivative financial instruments to hedge
    portions of its net investments in foreign operations against
    adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company measures
    ineffectiveness on the forward exchange contracts based upon the
    change in forward rates. There was no ineffectiveness recorded
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The Company’s consolidated statements of stockholders’
    equity for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
    include gains (losses) of ($180) million,
    ($17) million and ($115) million, respectively,
    related to foreign currency contracts and non-derivative
    financial instruments used to hedge its net investments in
    foreign operations. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    cumulative foreign currency translation loss recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive income related to these hedges
    was $369 million and $189 million, respectively. When
    net investments in foreign operations are sold or substantially
    liquidated, the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive
    income are reclassified to the consolidated statements of
    income, while a pro rata portion will be reclassified upon
    partial sale of the net investments in foreign operations.

Non-qualifying
    Derivatives and Derivatives for Purposes Other Than
    Hedging

The Company enters into the following derivatives that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 or for purposes
    other than hedging: (i) interest rate swaps, purchased caps
    and floors, and interest rate futures to economically hedge its
    exposure to interest rate volatility; (ii) foreign currency
    forwards, swaps and option contracts to economically hedge its
    exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates;
    (iii) swaptions to sell embedded call options in fixed rate
    liabilities; (iv) credit default swaps to economically
    hedge exposure to adverse movements in credit; (v) equity
    futures, equity index options, interest rate futures and equity
    variance swaps to economically hedge liabilities embedded in
    certain variable annuity products; (vi) swap spread locks
    to economically hedge invested assets against the risk of
    changes in credit spreads; (vii) financial forwards to buy and
    sell securities; (viii) synthetic guaranteed interest
    contracts; (ix) credit default swaps and TRRs to
    synthetically create investments; (x) basis swaps to better
    match the cash flows of assets and related liabilities;

Credit
    Risk

The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event
    of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial
    instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of the
    Company’s derivative contracts is limited to the fair value
    at the reporting date. The credit exposure of the Company’s
    derivative transactions is represented by the fair value of
    contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date.

The Company manages its credit risk related to over-the-counter
    derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was obligated to
    return cash collateral under its control of $833 million
    and $428 million, respectively. This unrestricted cash
    collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents and the
    obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral
    under securities loaned and other transactions in the
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Company had also accepted collateral consisting of
    various securities with a fair market value of $678 million
    and $453 million, respectively, which are held in separate
    custodial accounts. The Company is permitted by contract to sell
    or repledge this collateral, but as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, none of the collateral had been sold or repledged.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company provided
    collateral of $162 million and $80 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities in
    the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has
    exchange traded futures, which require the pledging of
    collateral. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    pledged collateral of $167 million and $105 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities.
    The counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or repledge
    this collateral.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate account assets and liabilities include two categories
    of account types: pass-through separate accounts totaling
    $141.8 billion and $127.9 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, for which the policyholder assumes
    all investment risk, and separate accounts with a minimum return
    or account value for which the Company contractually guarantees
    either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder
    which totaled $18.4 billion and $16.5 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The latter
    category consisted primarily of Met Managed GICs and
    participating close-out contracts. The average interest rate
    credited on these contracts was 4.73% and 4.63% at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Fees charged to the separate accounts by the Company (including
    mortality charges, policy administration fees and surrender
    charges) are reflected in the Company’s revenues as
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees and
    totaled $2.8 billion, $2.4 billion and

    Under Funding Agreements

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut (“MICC”) is a
    member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the “FHLB
    of Boston”) and holds $70 million of common stock of
    the FHLB of Boston at both December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    which is included in equity securities. MICC has also entered
    into funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston whereby MICC has
    issued such funding agreements in exchange for cash and for
    which the FHLB of Boston has been granted a blanket lien on
    certain MICC assets, including residential mortgage-backed
    securities, to collateralize MICC’s obligations under the
    funding agreements. MICC maintains control over these pledged
    assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any
    portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of
    default by MICC, the FHLB of Boston’s recovery on the
    collateral is limited to the amount of MICC’s liability to
    the FHLB of Boston. The amount of the Company’s liability
    for funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston was
    $726 million and $926 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in policyholder
    account balances. The advances on these funding agreements are
    collateralized by residential mortgage-backed securities with
    fair values of $901 million and $1.1 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

    maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use,
    commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral
    as long as there is no event of default and the remaining
    qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral
    maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MLIC, the FHLB
    of NY’s recovery on the collateral is limited to the amount
    of MLIC’s liability to the FHLB of NY. The amount of the
    Company’s liability for funding agreements with the FHLB of
    NY was $4.6 billion at December 31, 2007, which is
    included in policyholder account balances. The advances on these
    agreements are collateralized by residential mortgage-backed
    securities with fair values of $4.8 billion at

During 2007 and 2006, as a result of changes in estimates of
    insured events in the respective prior year, claims and claim
    adjustment expenses associated with prior years decreased by
    $325 million and $329 million, respectively, due to a
    reduction in prior year automobile bodily injury and
    homeowners’ severity, reduced loss adjustment expenses,
    improved loss ratio for non-medical health claim liabilities and
    improved claim management.

In 2005, the claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased by
    $180 million due to a reduction in prior year automobile
    bodily injury and homeowners’ severity as well as
    refinement in the estimation methodology for non-medical health
    long-term care claim liabilities.

Guarantees

The Company issues annuity contracts which may include
    contractual guarantees to the contractholder for:
    (i) return of no less than total deposits made to the
    contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net
    deposits”); and (ii) the highest contract value on a
    specified anniversary date minus any withdrawals following the
    contract

anniversary, or total deposits made to the contract less any
    partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (“anniversary
    contract value” or “minimum return”). The Company
    also issues annuity contracts that apply a lower rate of funds
    deposited if the contractholder elects to surrender the contract
    for cash and a higher rate if the contractholder elects to
    annuitize (“two tier annuities”). These guarantees
    include benefits that are payable in the event of death or at
    annuitization.

The Company also issues universal and variable life contracts
    where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder
    a secondary guarantee or a guaranteed

Reinsurance

The Company’s life insurance operations participate in
    reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize
    exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for
    future growth. The Company has historically reinsured the
    mortality risk on new individual life insurance policies
    primarily on an excess of retention basis or a quota share
    basis. Until 2005, the Company reinsured up to 90% of the
    mortality risk for all new individual life insurance policies
    that it wrote through its various franchises. This practice was
    initiated by the different franchises for different products
    starting at various points in time between 1992 and 2000. During
    2005, the Company changed its retention practices for certain
    individual life insurance. Amounts reinsured in prior years
    remain reinsured under the original reinsurance; however, under
    the new retention guidelines, the Company reinsures up to 90% of
    the mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most new
    individual life insurance policies that it writes through its
    various franchises and for certain individual life policies the
    retention limits remained unchanged. On a case by case basis,
    the Company may retain up to $20 million per life and
    reinsure 100% of amounts in excess of the Company’s
    retention limits. The Company evaluates its reinsurance programs
    routinely and may increase or decrease its retention at any
    time. In addition, the Company reinsures a significant portion
    of the mortality risk on its individual universal life policies
    issued since 1983. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on
    an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks
    with specific characteristics.

In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described
    previously, the Company reinsures other risks, as well as
    specific coverages. The Company routinely reinsures certain
    classes of risks in order to limit its exposure to particular
    travel, avocation and lifestyle hazards. The Company has
    exposure to catastrophes, which could contribute to significant
    fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations. The
    Company uses excess of retention and quota share reinsurance
    arrangements to provide greater diversification of risk and
    minimize exposure to larger risks.

The Company had also protected itself through the purchase of
    combination risk coverage. This reinsurance coverage pooled
    risks from several lines of business and included individual and
    group life claims in excess of $2 million per policy, as
    well as excess property and casualty losses, among others. This
    combination risk coverage was commuted during 2005.

The Company reinsures its business through a diversified group
    of reinsurers. No single unaffiliated reinsurer has a material
    obligation to the Company nor is the Company’s business
    substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contracts. The
    Company is contingently liable with respect to ceded reinsurance
    should any reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations under
    these agreements.

In the Reinsurance Segment, Reinsurance Group of America,
    Incorporated (“RGA”) retains a maximum of
    $6 million of coverage per individual life with respect to
    its assumed reinsurance business.

The amounts in the consolidated statements of income are
    presented net of reinsurance ceded. Information regarding the

Closed
    Block

On April 7, 2000, (the “Demutualization Date”),
    MLIC converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock
    life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New
    York Superintendent of Insurance (the
    “Superintendent”) approving MLIC’s plan of
    reorganization, as amended (the “Plan”). On the
    Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the
    benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies
    of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an
    amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which,
    together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in
    the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to
    support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies,
    including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of
    claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the
    continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999,
    if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and
    for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience
    changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and
    projected experience against the experience assumed in the
    then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted
    periodically to give effect to changes in experience.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies
    in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows
    from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and
    other experience related to the closed block are, in the
    aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the
    closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed
    block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less
    than the total dividends that would have been paid to these
    policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect for
    1999 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts
    assumed will be available for distribution over time to closed
    block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders.
    If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed
    policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets
    outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in
    effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains
    in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over
    100 years.

The Company uses the same accounting principles to account for
    the participating policies included in the closed block as it
    used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company
    establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that
    will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as
    described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over
    closed block assets at the effective date of the demutualization
    (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in
    accumulated other comprehensive income) represents the estimated
    maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result
    from operations attributed to the closed block after income
    taxes. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income
    over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block
    remain in-force. Management believes that over time the actual
    cumulative earnings of the closed block will approximately equal
    the expected cumulative earnings due to the effect of dividend
    changes. If, over the period the closed block remains in
    existence, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block is
    greater

than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the
    Company will pay the excess of the actual cumulative earnings of
    the closed block over the expected cumulative earnings to closed
    block policyholders as additional policyholder dividends unless
    offset by future unfavorable experience of the closed block and,
    accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative
    earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder
    dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative
    earnings of the closed block is less than the expected
    cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will
    recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the
    Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future,
    which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until
    the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative
    earnings.

    $471 million in 2012 and $6,912 million thereafter.

Repurchase agreements and capital lease obligations are
    collateralized and rank highest in priority, followed by
    unsecured senior debt which consists of senior notes, fixed rate
    notes and other notes with varying interest rates, followed by
    subordinated debt which consists of junior subordinated
    debentures. Payments of interest and principal on the
    Company’s surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other
    obligations at the operating company level and senior to
    obligations at the Holding Company, may be made only with the
    prior approval of the insurance department of the state of
    domicile. Collateral financing arrangements are supported by
    either surplus notes of subsidiaries or financing arrangements
    with the Holding Company and accordingly have priority
    consistent with other such obligations.

Senior
    Notes

In March 2007, RGA issued $300 million of

10-year

senior notes with a fixed rate of 5.625%, payable semiannually.
    RGA used $50 million of the net proceeds of the offering to
    repay existing debt during the year ended December 31, 2007.

The Holding Company repaid a $500 million 5.25% senior
    note which matured in December 2006 and a $1,006 million
    3.911% senior note which matured in May 2005. RGA repaid a
    $100 million 7.25% senior note which matured in April
    2006.

In connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005, which is described in Note 2, the
    Holding Company issued the following debt:

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued $1,000 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due
    June 15, 2015 at a discount of $2.7 million
    ($997.3 million) and $1,000 million aggregate
    principal amount of 5.70% senior notes due June 15,
    2035 at a discount of $2.4 million ($997.6 million).
    In connection with the offering, the Holding Company incurred
    $12.4 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized
    and included in other assets. These costs are being amortized
    using the effective interest method over the respective term of
    the related senior notes.

    amount of 5.25% senior notes due June 29, 2020 at a
    discount of 4.5 million pounds sterling ($8.1 million
    at issuance), for aggregate proceeds of 395.5 million
    pounds sterling ($721.1 million at issuance). The senior
    notes were initially offered and sold outside the United States
    in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In connection
    with the offering, the Holding Company incurred
    $3.7 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized

Repurchase
    Agreements with Federal Home Loan Bank

MetLife Bank, National Association (“MetLife Bank”) is
    a member of the FHLB of NY and holds $64 million and
    $54 million of common stock of the FHLB of NY at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included
    in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also entered into
    repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby MetLife Bank
    has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for cash and for
    which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket lien on MetLife
    Bank’s residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities
    to collateralize MetLife Bank’s obligations under the
    repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank maintains control over these
    pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of
    any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The repurchase
    agreements and the related security agreement represented by
    this blanket lien provide that upon any event of default by
    MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the
    amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the outstanding
    repurchase agreements. During the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, MetLife Bank received advances totaling
    $390 million, $260 million and $775 million,
    respectively, from the FHLB of NY. MetLife Bank also made
    repayments of $175 million, $117 million and
    $25 million, respectively, for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The amount of the
    Company’s liability for repurchase agreements with the FHLB
    of NY was $1.2 billion and $998 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included
    in long-term debt. The advances on these repurchase agreements
    are collateralized by residential mortgage-backed securities and
    residential mortgage loans with fair values of $1.3 billion
    at both December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Surplus
    Notes

MLIC repaid a $250 million 7% surplus note which matured on

Collateral
    Financing Arrangements

Associated
    with the Closed Block

In December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block
    liabilities to MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston
    (“MRC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In
    connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors
    placed by an unaffiliated financial institution,
    $2.5 billion of

35-year

surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the
    assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes
    accrues at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus 55 basis points, payable quarterly. The ability
    of MRC to make interest and principal payments on the surplus
    notes is contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval.

Simultaneous with issuing the surplus notes, the Holding Company
    entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated financial
    institution, under which the Holding Company is entitled to the
    interest paid by MRC on the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 55 basis points in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 112 basis points, payable quarterly. Under this
    agreement, the Holding Company may also be required to make
    payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to
    any decline in the market value of the surplus notes and in
    connection with any early termination of this agreement.

A majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus
    notes were placed in trust to support MRC’s statutory
    obligations associated with the assumed closed block
    liabilities. The trust is a VIE which is consolidated by the
    Company.

At December 31, 2007, the Company held assets in trust of
    $1.9 billion associated with the transaction. The
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes these assets
    as fixed maturity securities. The Company’s consolidated
    statement of income includes the investment returns on the
    assets held as collateral as net

F-73


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

investment income and the interest on the collateral financing
    arrangement is included as a component of other expenses.

Total interest expense was $5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Associated
    with Secondary Guarantees

In May 2007, the Holding Company and MRSC entered into a

30-year

collateral financing arrangement with an unaffiliated financial
    institution that provides up to $3.5 billion of statutory
    reserve support for MRSC associated with reinsurance obligations
    under intercompany reinsurance agreements. Such statutory
    reserves are associated with universal life secondary guarantees
    and are required under U.S. Valuation of Life Policies
    Model Regulation (commonly referred to as

Regulation A-XXX).

At December 31, 2007, $2.4 billion had been drawn upon
    under the collateral financing arrangement. The collateral
    financing arrangement may be extended by agreement of the
    Holding Company and the unaffiliated financial institution on
    each anniversary of the closing.

Proceeds from the collateral financing arrangement were placed
    in trust to support MRSC’s statutory obligations associated
    with the reinsurance of secondary guarantees. The trust is a VIE
    which is consolidated by the Company. The unaffiliated financial
    institution is entitled to the return on the investment
    portfolio held by the trust.

Simultaneous with entering into the collateral financing
    arrangement, the Holding Company entered into an agreement with
    the same unaffiliated financial institution under which the
    Holding Company is entitled to the return on the investment
    portfolio held by the trust established in connection with this
    collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the payment of
    a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial
    institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 70 basis points, payable quarterly. The Holding
    Company may also be required to make payments to the
    unaffiliated financial institution, for deposit into the trust,
    related to any decline in the market value of the assets held by
    the trust, as well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early
    termination of the collateral financing arrangement.

At December 31, 2007, the Company held assets in trust of
    $2.3 billion associated with this transaction. The
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes these assets
    as fixed maturity securities. The Company’s consolidated
    statement of income includes the investment returns on the
    assets held as collateral as net investment income and the
    interest on the collateral financing arrangement is included as
    a component of other expenses.

Transaction costs associated with the collateral financing
    arrangement of $5 million have been capitalized, are
    included in other assets, and are amortized using the effective
    interest method over the period from the issuance of the
    collateral financing arrangement to its expiration. Total
    interest expense was $84 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Associated
    with RGA

In June 2006, Timberlake Financial L.L.C., (“Timberlake
    Financial”), a subsidiary of RGA, completed an offering of
    $850 million of Series A Floating Rate Insured Notes
    due June 2036 in a private placement. Interest on the notes
    accrues at an annual rate of

1-month

LIBOR plus 29 basis points payable monthly. The payment of
    interest and principal on the notes is insured through a
    financial guaranty insurance policy with a third party. The
    notes represent senior, secured indebtedness of Timberlake
    Financial with no recourse to RGA or its other subsidiaries. Up
    to $150 million of additional notes may be offered in the
    future. In order to make payments of principal and interest on
    the notes, Timberlake Financial will rely upon the receipt of
    interest and principal payments on surplus note and dividend
    payments from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Timberlake
    Reinsurance Company II (“Timberlake Re”), a South
    Carolina captive insurance company. The ability of Timberlake Re
    to make interest and principal payments on the surplus note and
    dividend payments to Timberlake Financial is contingent upon
    South Carolina regulatory approval and the performance of
    specified term life insurance policies with guaranteed level
    premiums retroceded by RGA’s subsidiary, RGA Reinsurance
    Company (“RGA Reinsurance”), to Timberlake Re.

F-74


MetLife,

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Proceeds from the offering of the notes, along with a
    $113 million direct investment by RGA, collateralize the
    notes and are not available to satisfy the general obligations
    of RGA or the Company. Most of these assets were placed in a
    trust and provide long-term collateral as support for statutory
    reserves required by U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model
    Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX) on term
    life insurance policies with guaranteed level premium periods
    reinsured by RGA Reinsurance. The trust is consolidated by
    Timberlake Re which in-turn is consolidated by Timberlake
    Financial. Timberlake Financial is considered to be a VIE and
    RGA is considered to be the primary beneficiary. As such, the
    results of Timberlake Financial have been consolidated by RGA
    and ultimately by the Company.

At December 31, 2007, the Company held assets in trust of
    $899 million associated with the transaction. In addition
    the Company held $50 million in custody as of
    December 31, 2007. The Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets include the assets of Timberlake Financial recorded as
    fixed maturity securities and other invested assets, which
    consists of the restricted cash and cash equivalents held in
    custody. The Company’s consolidated statements of income
    include the investment returns on the assets held as collateral
    as investment income and the interest on the notes is included
    as a component of other expenses.

Issuance costs associated with the offering of the notes of
    $13 million have been capitalized, are included in other
    assets, and are amortized using the effective interest method
    over the estimated life of the notes. Total interest expense was
    $52 million and $26 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

    Subordinated Debentures Underlying Common Equity
    Units

In connection with the acquisition of Travelers on July 1,
    2005, the Holding Company issued on June 21, 2005
    $1,067 million 4.82% Series A and $1,067 million
    4.91% Series B junior subordinated debentures due no later
    than February 15, 2039 and February 15, 2040,
    respectively, for a total of $2,134 million in connection
    with the common equity units more fully described in
    Note 13. Interest expense related to the junior
    subordinated debentures underlying common equity units was
    $104 million, $104 million and $55 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Other
    Junior Subordinated Debentures Issued by the Holding
    Company

In December 2006, the Holding Company issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $1.25 billion. The
    debentures are scheduled for redemption on December 15,
    2036; the final maturity of the debentures is December 15,
    2066. The Holding Company may redeem the debentures (i) in
    whole or in part, at any time on or after December 15, 2031
    at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to
    the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances,
    in whole or in part, prior to December 15, 2031 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest is
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.40% up to, but not
    including, December 15, 2036, the scheduled redemption
    date. In the event the debentures are not redeemed on or before
    the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an annual
    rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.205%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for a period up to ten years. Interest compounds
    during such periods of deferral. If interest is deferred for
    more than five consecutive years, the Holding Company may be
    required to use proceeds from the sale of its common stock or
    warrants on common stock to satisfy its obligation. In
    connection with the issuance of the debentures, the Holding
    Company entered into a replacement capital covenant
    (“RCC”). As part of the RCC, the Holding Company
    agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the
    debentures on or before December 15, 2056, unless, subject
    to certain limitations, it has received proceeds from the sale
    of specified capital securities. The RCC will terminate upon the
    occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration of the
    debentures due to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC
    is not intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and
    may not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of
    holders of one or more other designated series of its
    indebtedness

(which will initially be its 5.70% senior notes due
    June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered into a
    replacement capital obligation which will commence in 2036 and
    under which the Holding Company must use reasonable commercial
    efforts to raise replacement capital through the issuance of
    certain qualifying capital securities. Issuance costs associated
    with the offering of the debentures of $13 million have
    been capitalized, are included in other assets, and are
    amortized using the effective interest method over the period
    from the issuance date of the debentures until their scheduled
    redemption. Interest expense on the debentures was
    $80 million and $2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In December 2007, MetLife Capital Trust IV
    (“Trust IV”), a VIE consolidated by the Company,
    issued exchangeable surplus trust securities (the
    “Trust Securities”) with a face amount of
    $700 million and a discount of $6 million
    ($694 million). The Trust Securities will be exchanged
    into a like amount of Holding Company junior subordinated
    debentures on December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption
    date; mandatorily under certain circumstances; and at any time
    upon the Holding Company exercising its option to redeem the
    securities. The Trust Securities will be exchanged for
    junior subordinated debentures prior to repayment. The final
    maturity of the debentures is December 15, 2067. The
    Holding Company may cause the redemption of the
    Trust Securities or debentures (i) in whole or in
    part, at any time on or after December 15, 2032 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or
    in part, prior to December 15, 2032 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest on the
    Trust Securities or debentures is payable semi-annually at
    a fixed rate of 7.875% up to, but not including,
    December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption date. In the
    event the Trust Securities or debentures are not redeemed
    on or before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue
    at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 3.96%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    Trust Securities or debentures for a period up to ten
    years. Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If
    interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, the
    Holding Company may be required to use proceeds from the sale of
    its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy its
    obligation. In connection with the issuance of the
    Trust Securities, the Holding Company entered into a RCC.
    As a part of the RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will
    not repay, redeem, or purchase the debentures on or before
    December 15, 2057, unless, subject to certain limitations,
    it has received proceeds from the sale of specified capital
    securities. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of
    certain events, including an acceleration of the debentures due
    to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC is not
    intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and may
    not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of holders
    of one or more other designated series of its indebtedness
    (which will initially be its 5.70% senior notes due
    June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered into a
    replacement capital obligation which will commence in 2037 and
    under which the Holding Company must use reasonable commercial
    efforts to raise replacement capital through the issuance of
    certain qualifying capital securities. Issuance costs associated
    with the offering of the Trust Securities of
    $10 million have been capitalized, are included in other
    assets, and are amortized using the effective interest method
    over the period from the issuance date of the
    Trust Securities until their scheduled redemption. Interest
    expense on the Trust Securities was $3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

Junior
    Subordinated Debentures Issued by RGA

In December 2005, RGA issued junior subordinated debentures with
    a face amount of $400 million. Interest is payable
    semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.75% up to but not including
    the scheduled redemption date, December 15, 2015. The
    debentures may be redeemed (i) in whole or in part, at any
    time on or after December 15, 2015 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in whole or in part, prior to
    December 15, 2015 at their principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, a
    make-whole price. In the event the debentures are not redeemed
    on or before the scheduled redemption date of December 15,
    2015, interest on these debentures will accrue at an annual rate
    of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.665%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The final maturity of the debentures is
    December 15, 2065. RGA has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for

F-76

    Statements — (Continued)

a period up to ten years. Upon an optional or mandatory deferral
    of interest payments, RGA is generally not permitted to pay
    common stock dividends or make payments of interest or principal
    on securities which rank equal or junior to the subordinated
    debentures, until the accrued and unpaid interest on the
    subordinated debentures is paid. Interest compounds during
    periods of deferral. Issuance costs associated with the offering
    of the debentures of $6 million have been capitalized, are
    included in other assets, and are amortized using the effective
    interest method over the period from the issuance date of the
    debentures until their scheduled redemption. Interest expense on
    the debentures was $27 million, $27 million and
    $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

Common
    Equity Units

In connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005, which is described in Note 2, the
    Holding Company distributed and sold 82.8 million 6.375%
    common equity units for $2,070 million in proceeds in a
    registered public offering on June 21, 2005. As described
    below, the common equity units consist of interests in trust
    preferred securities issued by MetLife Capital Trusts II
    and III, and stock purchase contracts issued by the Holding
    Company. The only assets of MetLife Capital Trusts II
    and III are junior subordinated debentures issued by the
    Holding Company.

Common
    Equity Units

Each common equity unit has an initial stated amount of $25 per
    unit and consists of: (i) a 1/80 or 1.25% ($12.50),
    undivided beneficial ownership interest in a series A trust
    preferred security of MetLife Capital Trust II
    (“Series A Trust”), with an initial liquidation
    amount of $1,000; (ii) a


/


or 1.25% ($12.50), undivided beneficial ownership interest in a
    series B trust preferred security of MetLife Capital
    Trust III (“Series B Trust” and, together
    with the Series A Trust, the “Capital Trusts”),
    with an initial liquidation amount of $1,000; (iii) a stock
    purchase contract under which the holder of the common equity
    unit will purchase and the Holding Company will sell, on each of
    the initial stock purchase date and the subsequent stock
    purchase date, a variable number of shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for a
    purchase price of $12.50.

Junior
    Subordinated Debentures Issued to Support Trust Common and
    Preferred Securities

The Holding Company issued $1,067 million 4.82%
    Series A and $1,067 million 4.91% Series B junior
    subordinated debt securities due no later than February 15,
    2039 and February 15, 2040, respectively, for a total of
    $2,134 million, in exchange for $2,070 million in
    aggregate proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred
    securities by the Capital Trusts and $64 million in trust
    common securities issued equally by the Capital Trusts. The
    common and preferred securities of the Capital Trusts, totaling
    $2,134 million, represent undivided beneficial ownership
    interests in the assets of the Capital Trusts, have no stated
    maturity and must be redeemed upon maturity of the corresponding
    series of junior subordinated debt securities — the
    sole assets of the respective Capital Trusts. The Series A
    Trust and Series B Trust will each make quarterly
    distributions on the common and preferred securities at an
    annual rate of 4.82% and 4.91%, respectively.

The trust common securities, which are held by the Holding
    Company, represent a 3% interest in the Trusts and are reflected
    as fixed maturity securities in the consolidated balance sheet
    of MetLife, Inc. The Capital Trusts are VIEs in accordance with
    FIN 46(r), and the Company does not consolidate its
    interest in MetLife Capital Trusts II and III as it is
    not the primary beneficiary of either of the Capital Trusts.

The Holding Company has directly guaranteed the repayment of the
    trust preferred securities to the holders thereof to the extent
    that there are funds available in the Capital Trusts. The
    guarantee will remain in place until the full redemption of the
    trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities held
    by the common equity unit holders are pledged to the Holding
    Company to collateralize the obligation of the common equity
    unit holders under the related stock purchase contracts. The
    common equity unit holder may substitute certain zero coupon
    treasury securities in place of the trust preferred securities
    as collateral under the stock purchase contract.

MetLife,

    Statements — (Continued)

The trust preferred securities have remarketing dates which
    correspond with the initial and subsequent stock purchase dates
    to provide the holders of the common equity units with the
    proceeds to exercise the stock purchase contracts. The initial
    stock purchase date is expected to be August 15, 2008, but
    could be deferred for quarterly periods until February 15,
    2009, and the subsequent stock purchase date is expected to be
    February 15, 2009, but could be deferred for quarterly
    periods until February 15, 2010. At the remarketing date,
    the remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the
    interest rate on the trust preferred securities to generate
    sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the common equity
    unit holder’s obligation under the stock purchase contract,
    subject to a reset cap for each of the first two attempted
    remarketings of each series. The interest rate on the supporting
    junior subordinated debt securities issued by the Holding
    Company will be reset at a commensurate rate. If the initial
    remarketing is unsuccessful, the remarketing agent will attempt
    to remarket the trust preferred securities, as necessary, in
    subsequent quarters through February 15, 2009 for the
    Series A trust preferred securities and through
    February 15, 2010 for the Series B trust preferred
    securities. The final attempt at remarketing will not be subject
    to the reset cap. If all remarketing attempts are unsuccessful,
    the Holding Company has the right, as a secured party, to apply
    the liquidation amount on the trust preferred securities to the
    common equity unit holders obligation under the stock purchase
    contract and to deliver to the common equity unit holder a
    junior subordinated debt security payable on August 15,
    2010 at an annual rate of 4.82% and 4.91% on the Series A
    and Series B trust preferred securities, respectively, in
    payment of any accrued and unpaid distributions.

Stock
    Purchase Contracts

Each stock purchase contract requires the holder of the common
    equity unit to purchase, and the Holding Company to sell, for
    $12.50, on each of the initial stock purchase date and the
    subsequent stock purchase date, a number of newly issued or
    treasury shares of the Holding Company’s common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, equal to the applicable settlement rate.
    The settlement rate at the respective stock purchase date will
    be calculated based on the closing price of the common stock
    during a specified

20-day

period immediately preceding the applicable stock purchase date.
    If the market value of the Holding Company’s common stock
    is less than the threshold appreciation price of $53.10 but
    greater than $43.35, the reference price, the settlement rate
    will be a number of the Holding Company’s common stock
    equal to the stated amount of $12.50 divided by the market
    value. If the market value is less than or equal to the
    reference price, the settlement rate will be 0.28835 shares
    of the Holding Company’s common stock. If the market value
    is greater than or equal to the threshold appreciation price,
    the settlement rate will be 0.23540 shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock as adjusted in accordance with the
    terms of the stock purchase contracts. Accordingly, upon
    settlement in the aggregate, the Holding Company will receive
    proceeds of $2,070 million and issue between
    39.0 million and 47.8 million shares of its common
    stock. The stock purchase contract may be exercised at the
    option of the holder at any time prior to the settlement date.
    However, upon early settlement, the holder will receive the
    minimum settlement rate.

The stock purchase contracts further require the Holding Company
    to pay the holder of the common equity unit quarterly contract
    payments on the stock purchase contracts at the annual rate of
    1.510% on the stated amount of $25 per stock purchase contract
    until the initial stock purchase date and at the annual rate of
    1.465% on the remaining stated amount of $12.50 per stock
    purchase contract thereafter.

The quarterly distributions on the Series A and
    Series B trust preferred securities of 4.82% and 4.91%,
    respectively, combined with the contract payments on the stock
    purchase contract of 1.510%, (1.465% after the initial stock
    purchase date) result in the 6.375% yield on the common equity
    units.

If the Holding Company defers any of the contract payments on
    the stock purchase contract, then it will accrue additional
    amounts on the deferred amounts at the annual rate of 6.375%
    until paid, to the extent permitted by law.

The value of the stock purchase contracts at issuance,
    $96.6 million, were calculated as the present value of the
    future contract payments due under the stock purchase contract
    of 1.510% through the initial stock purchase date, and 1.465% up
    to the subsequent stock purchase date, discounted at the
    interest rate on the supporting junior subordinated debt
    securities issued by the Holding Company, 4.82% or 4.91% on the
    Series A and Series B trust

F-78


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

preferred securities, respectively. The value of the stock
    purchase contracts was recorded in other liabilities with an
    offsetting decrease in additional paid-in capital. The other
    liability balance related to the stock purchase contracts will
    accrue interest at the discount rate of 4.82% or 4.91%, as
    applicable, with an offsetting increase to interest expense.
    When the contract payments are made under the stock purchase
    contracts they will reduce the other liability balance. During
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    Holding Company increased the other liability balance for the
    accretion of the discount on the contract payment of
    $2 million, $3 million and $2 million and made
    contract payments of $31 million, $31 million and
    $13 million, respectively.

Issuance
    Costs

In connection with the offering of common equity units, the
    Holding Company incurred $55.3 million of issuance costs of
    which $5.8 million relate to the issuance of the junior
    subordinated debt securities underlying common equity units
    which fund the Series A and Series B trust preferred
    securities and $49.5 million relate to the expected
    issuance of the common stock under the stock purchase contracts.
    The $5.8 million in debt issuance costs have been
    capitalized, are included in other assets, and are being
    amortized using the effective interest method over the period
    from issuance date of the common equity units to the initial and
    subsequent stock purchase date. The remaining $49.5 million
    of costs relate to the common stock issuance under the stock
    purchase contracts and have been recorded as a reduction of
    additional paid-in capital.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

The stock purchase contracts are reflected in diluted earnings
    per common share using the treasury stock method, and are
    dilutive when the average closing price of the Company’s
    common stock for each of the 20 trading days before the close of
    the accounting period is greater than or equal to the threshold
    appreciation price of $53.10. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the average closing price for
    each of the 20 trading days before December 31 was greater than
    the threshold appreciation price. Accordingly, the stock
    purchase contracts were included in diluted earnings per common
    share for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
    During the period from the date of issuance through
    December 31, 2005, the average closing price for each of
    the 20 trading days before December 31 was less than the
    threshold appreciate price. Accordingly, the stock purchase
    contracts were excluded in diluted earnings per common share for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. See Note 20.

Shares Subject
    to Mandatory Redemption and Company-Obligated Mandatorily
    Redeemable Securities of Subsidiary Trusts

GenAmerica Capital I.

In June 1997, GenAmerica
    Corporation (“GenAmerica”) issued $125 million of
    8.525% capital securities through a wholly-owned subsidiary
    trust, GenAmerica Capital I. In October 2007, GenAmerica
    redeemed these securities which were due to mature on
    June 30, 2027. As a result of this redemption, the Company
    recognized additional interest expense of $10 million.
    Capital securities outstanding were $119 million, net of
    unamortized discounts of $6 million at December 31,
    2006. Interest expense on these instruments is included in other
    expenses and was $20 million, $11 million and
    $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

RGA Capital Trust I.

In December 2001,
    RGA, through its wholly-owned trust, RGA Capital Trust I
    (the “RGA Trust”), issued 4,500,000 Preferred Income
    Equity Redeemable Securities (“PIERS”) Units. Each
    PIERS unit consists of: (i) a preferred security issued by
    the RGA Trust, having a stated liquidation amount of $50 per
    unit, representing an undivided beneficial ownership interest in
    the assets of the RGA Trust, which consist solely of junior
    subordinated debentures issued by RGA which have a principal
    amount at maturity of $50 and a stated maturity of
    March 18, 2051; and (ii) a warrant to purchase, at any
    time prior to December 15, 2050, 1.2508 shares of RGA
    stock at an exercise price of $50.

The fair market value of the warrant on the issuance date was
    $14.87 and is detachable from the preferred security. RGA fully
    and unconditionally guarantees, on a subordinated basis, the
    obligations of the Trust under the

preferred securities. The preferred securities and subordinated
    debentures were issued at a discount (original issue discount)
    to the face or liquidation value of $14.87 per security. The
    securities will accrete to their $50 face/liquidation value over
    the life of the security on a level yield basis. The weighted
    average effective interest rate on the preferred securities and
    the subordinated debentures is 8.25% per annum. Capital
    securities outstanding were $159 million, net of
    unamortized discounts of $66 million at both
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. Interest expense on these
    instruments is included in other expenses and was
    $13 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005.

    amount to $725 million at December 31, 2007 and were
    generated in various foreign countries with expiration periods
    of five years to indefinite expiration. Capital loss
    carryforwards amount to $463 million at December 31,
    2007 and will expire beginning in 2010. Tax credit carryforwards
    amount to $24 million at December 31, 2007.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to tax
    benefits of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
    The valuation allowance reflects management’s assessment,
    based on available information, that it is more likely than not
    that the deferred income tax asset for certain foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The tax
    benefit will be recognized when management believes that it is
    more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets are
    realizable. In 2007, the Company recorded a reduction of
    $104 million to the deferred income tax valuation allowance
    related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and
    other deferred tax assets.

The Company files income tax returns with the U.S. federal
    government and various state and local jurisdictions, as well as
    foreign jurisdictions. The Company is under continuous
    examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    and other tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company
    has significant business operations. The income tax years under
    examination vary by jurisdiction. With a few exceptions, the
    Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
    local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for
    years prior

to 2000. In the first quarter of 2005, the IRS commenced an
    examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns
    for 2000 through 2002 that is anticipated to be completed in
    2008.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48 on
    January 1, 2007, the Company recognized a $52 million
    increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, a
    $4 million decrease in the interest liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, and a corresponding reduction to the
    January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings of
    $37 million, net of $11 million of minority interest.
    The Company’s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
    upon adoption of FIN 48 was $1,128 million. The
    Company reclassified, at adoption, $611 million of current
    income tax payables to the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits included within other liabilities. The Company also
    reclassified, at adoption, $465 million of deferred income
    tax liabilities, for which the ultimate deductibility is highly
    certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of
    such deductibility, to the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
    other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the
    shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
    effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to
    the taxing authority to an earlier period. The total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007 that would
    affect the effective tax rate, if recognized, was
    $680 million. The Company also had $240 million of
    accrued interest, included within other liabilities, as of
    January 1, 2007. The Company classifies interest accrued
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense, while
    penalties are included within income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is $1,038 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, is $593 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by
    $90 million from the date of adoption primarily due to
    settlements reached with the IRS with respect to certain
    significant issues involving demutualization, post-sale purchase
    price adjustments, and reinsurance offset by additions for tax
    positions of the current year. As a result of the settlements,
    items within the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, in the
    amount of $177 million, were reclassified to current and
    deferred income taxes, as applicable, and a payment of
    $156 million was made in December of 2007 with the
    remaining $21 million to be paid in future years. In
    addition, the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits may change significantly in the next 12 months
    pending the outcome of remaining issues associated with the
    current IRS audit including demutualization, leasing, tax-exempt
    income, transfer pricing and tax credits. Management is working
    to resolve the remaining audit items directly with IRS auditors
    as well as through available accelerated IRS resolution programs
    and may protest any unresolved issues through the IRS appeals
    process and, possibly, litigation, the timing and extent of
    which is uncertain. Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the
    range of a payment or change in the liability cannot be made at
    this time; however, the Company continues to believe that the
    ultimate resolution of the issues will not result in a material
    effect on its consolidated financial statements, although the
    resolution of income tax matters could impact the Company’s
    effective tax rate for a particular future period.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31,
    2007, is as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recognized $98 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had $252 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $12 million increase, from the date of
    adoption, in accrued interest associated with the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an increase of
    $98 million of interest expense and an $86 million
    decrease primarily resulting from the aforementioned IRS
    settlements. During 2007, $73 million of the
    $86 million, resulting from IRS settlements, has been
    reclassified to current income tax payable and the remaining
    $13 million reduced interest expense.

On September 25, 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling

2007-61,

which announced its intention to issue regulations with respect
    to certain computational aspects of the Dividends Received
    Deduction (“DRD”) on separate account assets held in
    connection with variable annuity contracts. Revenue Ruling

2007-61

suspended a revenue ruling issued in August 2007 that would have
    changed accepted industry and IRS interpretations of the
    statutes governing these computational questions. Any
    regulations that the IRS ultimately proposes for issuance in
    this area will be subject to public notice and comment, at which
    time insurance companies and other interested parties will have
    the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the
    content, scope and application of such regulations. As a result,
    the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are
    unknown at this time. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Company recognized an income tax benefit of
    $188 million related to the separate account DRD.

Contingencies,
    Commitments and Guarantees

Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the
    jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may
    permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well
    exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for
    similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with
    the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving
    through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of
    time, demonstrate to management that the monetary relief which
    may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to
    its merits or disposition value. Thus, unless stated below, the
    specific monetary relief sought is not noted.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be inherently impossible to
    ascertain with any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties
    can include how fact finders will view individually and in their
    totality documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness
    of witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. The review includes senior legal and financial
    personnel. In 2007, the Company received $39 million upon
    the resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the
    2000 acquisition of General American Life Insurance Company
    (“GALIC”), and the Company reduced legal liabilities
    by $38 million after the settlement of certain cases.
    Unless stated below, estimates of possible losses or ranges of
    loss for particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be
    made with a reasonable degree of certainty. Liabilities are
    established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred
    and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
    Liabilities have been established for a number of the matters
    noted below; in 2007

the Company increased legal liabilities for pending sales
    practices, employment, property and casualty and intellectual
    property litigation matters against the Company. It is possible
    that some of the matters could require the Company to pay
    damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in
    amounts that could not be estimated as of December 31, 2007.

Demutualization
    Actions

Several lawsuits were brought in 2000 challenging the fairness
    of the Plan and the adequacy and accuracy of MLIC’s
    disclosure to policyholders regarding the Plan. The actions
    discussed below name as defendants some or all of MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. MLIC, the Holding
    Company, and the individual directors believe they have
    meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs’ claims and are
    contesting vigorously all of the plaintiffs’ claims in
    these actions.

Fiala, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (Sup.
    Ct., N.Y. County, filed March 17, 2000).

The
    plaintiffs in the consolidated state court class actions seek
    compensatory relief and punitive damages against MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. On January 30,
    2007, the trial court signed an order certifying a litigation
    class of present and former policyholders on plaintiffs’
    claim that defendants violated section 7312 of the New York
    Insurance Law, but denying plaintiffs’ motion to certify a
    litigation class with respect to a common law fraud claim.
    Plaintiffs and defendants have filed notices of appeal from this
    order. The court has directed various forms of class notice.

In re MetLife Demutualization Litig. (E.D.N.Y., filed
    April 18, 2000).

In this class action
    against MLIC and the Holding Company, plaintiffs served a second
    consolidated amended complaint in 2004. Plaintiffs assert
    violations of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), in
    connection with the Plan, claiming that the Policyholder
    Information Booklets failed to disclose certain material facts
    and contained certain material misstatements. They seek
    rescission and compensatory damages. By orders dated
    July 19, 2005 and August 29, 2006, the federal trial
    court certified a litigation class of present and former
    policyholders. The court has not yet directed the manner and
    form of class notice.

Asbestos-Related
    Claims

MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of
    asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in
    the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or
    selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC
    issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to
    companies in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned
    of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other
    things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health
    risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in
    these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters,
    however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables,
    including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions,
    the nature of the alleged injury, and factors unrelated to the
    ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC
    employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos
    loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending
    litigation by judicial rulings and settling litigation under
    appropriate circumstances.

Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence,
    intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks
    associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of
    certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no
    duty to the plaintiffs — it had no special
    relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture,
    produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly
    injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any
    actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the
    cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries;
    (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers
    of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with
    respect to filing suit has expired. During the

F-84


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

course of the litigation, certain trial courts have granted
    motions dismissing claims against MLIC, while other trial courts
    have denied MLIC’s motions to dismiss. There can be no
    assurance that MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions
    in the future. While most cases brought to date have settled,
    MLIC intends to continue to defend aggressively against claims
    based on asbestos exposure, including defending claims at trials.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate
    number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and
    the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve
    asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set
    forth in the following table:

Settlement payments represent payments made by MLIC during the
    year in connection with settlements made in that year and in
    prior years. Amounts do not include MLIC’s attorneys’
    fees and expenses and do not reflect amounts received from
    insurance carriers.

In 2004, MLIC received approximately 23,900 new claims, ending
    the year with a total of approximately 108,000 claims, and paid
    approximately $85.5 million for settlements reached in 2004
    and prior years. In 2003, MLIC received approximately 58,750 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 111,700
    claims, and paid approximately $84.2 million for
    settlements reached in 2003 and prior years. The number of
    asbestos cases that may be brought or the aggregate amount of
    any liability that MLIC may ultimately incur is uncertain.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    MLIC’s recorded asbestos liability is based on its
    estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts
    presently known to it, its understanding of current law, and its
    past experiences: (i) the reasonably probable and estimable
    liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC,
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    reasonably probable and estimable liability for asbestos claims
    not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are
    reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal
    defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant
    assumptions underlying MLIC’s analysis of the adequacy of
    its recorded liability with respect to asbestos litigation
    include: (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the
    cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims.

MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure
    from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims
    experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos
    claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant
    trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous
    variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an
    overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies
    of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative
    and judicial developments, the number of pending claims
    involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed
    against it and other defendants, and the jurisdictions in which
    claims are pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 MLIC
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. MLIC regularly reevaluates its exposure
    from asbestos litigation and has updated its liability analysis
    for asbestos-related claims through December 31, 2007.

The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure
    is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions
    impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change.
    The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult
    to predict with any certainty the numerous variables that can
    affect liability estimates, including the number of future
    claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity
    of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the
    number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations in the law in the

F-85


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of
    tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow
    plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure to
    asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were
    well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse
    verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be probable and
    reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be
    materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued
    and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the
    potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on
    information currently known by management, management does not
    believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position.

During 1998, MLIC paid $878 million in premiums for excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims. The excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims provide for
    recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion, which is in excess
    of a $400 million self-insured retention. The
    Company’s initial option to commute the excess insurance
    policies for asbestos-related claims arises at the end of 2008.
    Thereafter, the Company will have a commutation right every five
    years. The excess insurance policies for asbestos-related claims
    are also subject to annual and per claim sublimits. Amounts
    exceeding the sublimits during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    approximately $16 million, $8 million and $0,
    respectively. The Company continues to study per claim averages,
    and there can be no assurance as to the number and cost of
    claims resolved in the future, including related defense costs,
    and the applicability of the sublimits to these costs. Amounts
    are recoverable under the policies annually with respect to
    claims paid during the prior calendar year. Although amounts
    paid by MLIC in any given year that may be recoverable in the
    next calendar year under the policies will be reflected as a
    reduction in the Company’s operating cash flows for the
    year in which they are paid, management believes that the
    payments will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s liquidity.

Each asbestos-related policy contains an experience fund and a
    reference fund that provide for payments to MLIC at the
    commutation date if the reference fund is greater than zero at
    commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in the loss
    reimbursements to MLIC if the cumulative return on the reference
    fund is less than the return specified in the experience fund.
    The return in the reference fund is tied to performance of the
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500
    Index and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. A claim with
    respect to the prior year was made under the excess insurance
    policies in each year from 2003 through 2007 for the amounts
    paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of the
    retention. As the performance of the indices impacts the return
    in the reference fund, it is possible that loss reimbursements
    to the Company and the recoverable amount with respect to later
    periods may be less than the amount of the recorded losses.
    Foregone loss reimbursements may be recovered upon commutation
    depending upon future performance of the reference fund. If at
    some point in the future, the Company believes the liability for
    probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related
    claims should be increased, an expense would be recorded and the
    insurance recoverable would be adjusted subject to the terms,
    conditions and limits of the excess insurance policies. Portions
    of the change in the insurance recoverable would be recorded as
    a deferred gain and amortized into income over the estimated
    remaining settlement period of the insurance policies. The
    foregone loss reimbursements were approximately
    $56.1 million with respect to claims for the period of 2002
    through 2006 and are estimated, as of December 31, 2007, to
    be approximately $69.1 million in the aggregate, including
    future years.

Sales
    Practices Claims

Over the past several years, MLIC; New England Mutual Life
    Insurance Company, New England Life Insurance Company and New
    England Securities Corporation (collectively “New
    England”); GALIC; Walnut Street Securities, Inc.
    (“Walnut Street Securities”) and MetLife Securities,
    Inc. (“MSI”) have faced numerous claims, including
    class action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of
    individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds or
    other products.

As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately 130 sales
    practices litigation matters pending against the Company. The
    Company continues to vigorously defend against the claims in
    these matters. Some sales practices claims have been resolved
    through settlement. Other sales practices claims have been won
    by dispositive motions or have gone to trial. Most of the
    current cases seek substantial damages, including in some cases
    punitive and treble damages and attorneys’ fees. Additional
    litigation relating to the Company’s marketing and sales of
    individual life insurance, mutual funds or other products may be
    commenced in the future.

Two putative class action lawsuits involving sales practices
    claims are pending against MLIC in Canada. In

Jacynthe
    Evoy-Larouche v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (Que. Super.
    Ct., filed March 1998)

, plaintiff alleges misrepresentations
    regarding dividends and future payments for life insurance
    policies and seeks unspecified damages. In

Ace Quan v.
    Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (Ont. Gen. Div., filed April
    1997)

, plaintiff alleges breach of contract and negligent
    misrepresentations relating to, among other things, life
    insurance premium payments and seeks damages, including punitive
    damages.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to MLIC’s,
    New England’s, GALIC’s, MSI’s or Walnut
    Street Securities’ sales of individual life insurance
    policies or annuities or other products. Over the past several
    years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory
    authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain
    other relief. The Company may continue to resolve investigations
    in a similar manner. The Company believes adequate provision has
    been made in its consolidated financial statements for all
    probable and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices
    claims against MLIC, New England, GALIC, MSI and Walnut Street
    Securities.

Property
    and Casualty Actions

Katrina-Related Litigation.

There are a number
    of lawsuits, including a few putative class actions and
    “mass” actions, pending in Louisiana and Mississippi
    against Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company
    relating to Hurricane Katrina. The lawsuits include claims by
    policyholders for coverage for damages stemming from Hurricane
    Katrina, including for damages resulting from flooding or storm
    surge. The deadline for filing actions in Louisiana has expired.
    It is reasonably possible that additional actions will be filed
    in other states. The Company intends to continue to defend
    vigorously against these matters, although appropriate matters
    may be resolved as part of the ordinary claims adjustment
    process.

Shipley v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. and
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (Ill. Cir. Ct.,
    Madison County, filed February 26 and July 2,
    2003).

Two putative nationwide class actions have
    been filed against Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance
    Company in Illinois. One suit claims breach of contract and
    fraud due to the alleged underpayment of medical claims arising
    from the use of a purportedly biased provider fee pricing
    system. A motion for class certification has been filed and
    briefed. The second suit currently alleges breach of contract
    arising from the alleged use of preferred provider organizations
    to reduce medical provider fees covered by the medical claims

    Auto & Home, et ano (D. N.J., filed November 12,
    2007)

has been filed against Metropolitan Property and
    Casualty Insurance Company in federal court in New Jersey. The
    Company is vigorously defending against the claims in these
    matters.

Regulatory
    Matters

The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other
    inquiries from state regulators, including state insurance
    commissioners; state attorneys general or other state
    governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC;
    federal governmental authorities, including congressional
    committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    seeking a broad range of information. The issues involved in
    information requests and regulatory matters vary widely. Certain
    regulators have requested information and documents regarding
    contingent commission payments to brokers, the Company’s
    awareness of any “sham” bids for business, bids and

quotes that the Company submitted to potential customers,
    incentive agreements entered into with brokers, or compensation
    paid to intermediaries. Regulators also have requested
    information relating to market timing and late trading of mutual
    funds and variable insurance products and, generally, the
    marketing of products. The Company has received a subpoena from
    the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
    of California asking for documents regarding the insurance
    broker Universal Life Resources. The Company has been
    cooperating fully with these inquiries.

In 2005, MSI received a notice from the Illinois Department of
    Securities asserting possible violations of the Illinois
    Securities Act in connection with sales of a former
    affiliate’s mutual funds. A response has been submitted and
    in January 2008, MSI received notice of the commencement of an
    administrative action by the Illinois Department of Securities.
    MSI intends to vigorously defend against the claims in this
    matter.

Other
    Litigation

In Re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig. (D. N.J., filed
    February 24, 2005).

In this multi-district
    proceeding, plaintiffs filed a class action complaint
    consolidating claims from several separate actions that had been
    filed in or transferred to the District of New Jersey in 2004
    and 2005. The consolidated complaint alleged that the Holding
    Company, MLIC, several non-affiliated insurance companies and
    several insurance brokers violated the Racketeer Influenced and
    Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and
    antitrust laws and committed other misconduct in the context of
    providing insurance to employee benefit plans and to persons who
    participate in such employee benefit plans. In August and
    September 2007, the court issued orders granting
    defendants’ motions to dismiss with prejudice the federal
    antitrust and the RICO claims. In January 2008, the court issued
    an order granting defendants’ summary judgment motion on
    the ERISA claims, and in February 2008, the court dismissed the
    remaining state law claims on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs
    have filed a notice of appeal of the court’s decisions. A
    putative class action alleging that the Holding Company and
    other non-affiliated defendants violated state laws was
    transferred to the District of New Jersey but was not
    consolidated with other related actions. Plaintiffs’ motion
    to remand this action to state court in Florida is pending.

The American Dental Association, et al. v. MetLife Inc., et
    al. (S.D. Fla., filed May 19, 2003).

The
    American Dental Association and three individual providers have
    sued the Holding Company, MLIC and other non-affiliated
    insurance companies in a putative class action lawsuit. The
    plaintiffs purport to represent a nationwide class of

in-network

providers who allege that their claims are being wrongfully
    reduced by downcoding, bundling, and the improper use and
    programming of software. The complaint alleges federal
    racketeering and various state law theories of liability. The
    district court has granted in part and denied in part the
    Company’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed an
    amended complaint, and the Company filed another motion to
    dismiss. The court has issued a tag-along order, related to a
    medical managed care trial, which has stayed the lawsuit.

Thomas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (W.D.
    Okla., filed January 31, 2007).

A putative
    class action complaint was filed against MLIC and MSI.
    Plaintiffs assert legal theories of violations of the federal
    securities laws and violations of state laws with respect to the
    sale of certain proprietary products by the Company’s
    agency distribution group. Plaintiffs seek rescission,
    compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees and expenses. The Company is vigorously
    defending against the claims in this matter.

MLIC also has been named as a defendant in a number of welding
    and mixed dust lawsuits filed in various state and federal
    courts. The Company is continuing to vigorously defend against
    these claims.

Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise
    provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, have arisen in the course of the Company’s
    business, including, but not limited to, in

F-88


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

connection with its activities as an insurer, employer,
    investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state
    insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state
    authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations
    concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable
    insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all
    pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses, except as noted
    previously in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to previously, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require insurers doing business within the
    jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are
    organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
    offsets. Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments
    are as follows:

    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Impact
    of Hurricanes

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the
    states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, causing
    catastrophic damage to these coastal regions. MetLife’s
    cumulative gross losses from Hurricane Katrina were
    $314 million, $333 million and $335 million at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily
    arising from the Company’s homeowners business. During the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    recognized net losses, net of income tax and reinsurance
    recoverables and including reinstatement premiums and other
    reinsurance-related premium adjustments related to the
    catastrophe, of ($13) million, ($2) million and
    $134 million, respectively.

F-89


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

On October 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma made landfall across
    the state of Florida. MetLife’s cumulative gross losses
    from Hurricane Wilma were $66 million, $64 million and
    $57 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, primarily arising from the Company’s
    homeowners and automobile businesses. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s
    Auto & Home segment recognized net losses, net of
    income tax and reinsurance recoverables, of ($3) million and
    $32 million, respectively, related to Hurricane Wilma. The
    Company did not recognize any loss during the year ended
    December 31, 2007, related to Hurricane Wilma.

Additional hurricane-related losses may be recorded in future
    periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to
    reinsurers are processed. Reinsurance recoveries are dependent
    upon the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers, which may
    be affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and otherwise. In addition,
    lawsuits, including purported class actions, have been filed in
    Louisiana and Mississippi challenging denial of claims for
    damages caused to property during Hurricane Katrina.
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company is a named
    party in some of these lawsuits. In addition, rulings in cases
    in which Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company is
    not a party may affect interpretation of its policies.
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company intends to
    vigorously defend these matters. However, any adverse rulings
    could result in an increase in the Company’s
    hurricane-related claim exposure and losses. Based on
    information known by management, it does not believe that
    additional claim losses resulting from Hurricane Katrina will
    have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Argentina

The Argentinean economic, regulatory and legal environment,
    including interpretations of laws and regulations by regulators
    and courts, is uncertain. Potential legal or governmental
    actions related to pension reform, fiduciary responsibilities,
    performance guarantees and tax rulings could adversely affect
    the results of the Company. Upon acquisition of Citigroup’s
    insurance operations in Argentina, the Company established
    insurance liabilities, most significantly death and disability
    policy liabilities, based upon its interpretation of Argentinean
    law at the time and the Company’s best estimate of its
    obligations under such law. In 2006, a decree was issued by the
    Argentine Government regarding the taxability of
    pesification-related gains resulting in the reduction of certain
    tax liabilities. In 2007, pension reform legislation in
    Argentina was enacted which changed the Company’s
    obligations and resulted in the elimination of the death and
    disability liabilities and the establishment of a liability for
    servicing obligations.

Commitments

Leases

In accordance with industry practice, certain of the
    Company’s income from lease agreements with retail tenants
    are contingent upon the level of the tenants’ sales
    revenues. Additionally, the Company, as lessee, has entered into
    various lease and sublease agreements for office space, data
    processing and other equipment. Future minimum rental and
    sublease income, and minimum gross rental payments relating to
    these lease agreements are as follows:

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business. The amounts of these unfunded
    commitments were $5.3 billion and $3.0 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company
    anticipates that these amounts will be invested in partnerships
    over the next five years.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan
    commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $4.0 billion at both December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts
    of these unfunded commitments were $1.2 billion and
    $1.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Other
    Commitments

In December 2005, RGA repurchased 1.6 million shares of its
    outstanding common stock at an aggregate price of
    $76 million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement
    with a major bank. The bank borrowed the stock sold to RGA from
    third parties and purchased the shares in the open market over
    the subsequent few months to return to the lenders. RGA would
    either pay or receive an amount based on the actual amount paid
    by the bank to purchase the shares. These repurchases resulted
    in an increase in the Company’s ownership percentage of RGA
    to approximately 53% at December 31, 2005 from
    approximately 52% at December 31, 2004. In February 2006,
    the final purchase price was determined, resulting in a cash
    settlement substantially equal to the aggregate cost. RGA
    recorded the initial repurchase of shares as treasury stock and
    recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the cost of the
    treasury stock. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s
    ownership was approximately 52% of RGA.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as
    third party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to
    time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $800 million, with a cumulative maximum
    of $2.3 billion, while in other cases such limitations are
    not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations
    are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe
    that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    that could become due under these guarantees in the future.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these indemnities in the future.

MetLife,

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded a $1 million liability with respect to a guarantee
    previously provided to MLII, a former subsidiary. The
    Company’s recorded liabilities at December 31, 2007
    and 2006 for indemnities, guarantees and commitments were
    $6 million and $5 million, respectively.

In connection with synthetically created investment
    transactions, the Company writes credit default swap obligations
    that generally require payment of principal outstanding due in
    exchange for the referenced credit obligation. If a credit
    event, as defined by the contract, occurs the Company’s
    maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of the referenced
    credits becomes worthless, was $1.7 billion at
    December 31, 2007. The credit default swaps expire at
    various times during the next ten years.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Subsidiaries sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula.
    The traditional formula provides benefits based upon years of
    credited service and either final average or career average
    earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical or
    notional accounts which credit participants with benefits equal
    to a percentage of eligible pay as well as earnings credits,
    determined annually based upon the average annual rate of
    interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. As of
    December 31, 2007, virtually all of the Subsidiaries’
    obligations have been calculated using the traditional formula.
    The non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits,
    in excess of amounts permitted by governmental agencies, to
    certain executive level employees.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

In connection with the acquisition of Travelers, the employees
    of Travelers and any other Citigroup affiliate in the United
    States who became employees of certain Subsidiaries in
    connection with that acquisition (including those who remained
    employees of companies acquired in that acquisition) will be
    credited with service recognized by Citigroup for purposes of
    determining eligibility and vesting under the Plan with respect
    to benefits earned under the Plan subsequent to the closing date
    of the acquisition. Neither the Holding Company nor its
    subsidiaries assumed an obligation for benefits earned under
    defined benefit plans of Citigroup or Travelers prior to the
    acquisition.

As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 158. The
    adoption of SFAS 158 required the recognition of the funded
    status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans
    and eliminated the additional minimum pension liability
    provision of SFAS 87. The Company’s additional minimum
    pension liability was $78 million, and the intangible asset
    was $12 million, at December 31, 2005. The excess of
    the additional minimum pension liability over the intangible
    asset of $66 million, $41 million net of income tax,
    was recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
    income. At December 31, 2006, immediately prior to adopting
    SFAS 158, the Company’s additional minimum pension
    liability was $92 million. The additional minimum pension
    liability of $59 million, net of income tax of
    $33 million, was

F-92


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
    income. The change in the additional minimum pension liability
    of $18 million, net of income tax, was reflected as a
    component of comprehensive income for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Upon adoption of SFAS 158, the
    Company eliminated the additional minimum pension liability and
    recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of income tax, those amounts of actuarial gains and
    losses, prior service costs and credits, and the remaining net
    transition asset or obligation that had not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit cost at the date of adoption.

The following table summarizes the adjustments to the
    December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet as a result of
    recognizing the funded status of the defined benefit plans:

Included within other comprehensive income are other changes in
    plan assets and benefit obligations associated with pension
    benefits of ($477) million and other postretirement
    benefits of ($404) million for an aggregate reduction in
    other comprehensive income of ($881) million before income
    tax and $563 million, net of income tax and minority
    interest.

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service cost for
    the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other
    comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the
    next year are both $14 million.

The estimated net actuarial gains and prior service credit for
    the defined benefit other postretirement plans that will be
    amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net
    periodic benefit cost over the next year are less than
    $1 million and $37 million, respectively.

In 2004, the Company adopted the guidance in

    constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the
    valuation date, which would provide the necessary future cash
    flows to pay the aggregate projected benefit obligation when due.

Notes to

The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on
    anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which
    the plan invests, weighted by target allocation percentages.
    Anticipated future performance is based on long-term historical
    returns of the plan assets by sector, adjusted for the
    Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on the performance of
    the markets. While the precise expected return derived using
    this approach will fluctuate from year to year, the
    Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term assumption
    constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from
    the derived rate.

The weighted average expected return on plan assets for use in
    that plan’s valuation in 2008 is currently anticipated to
    be 8.25% for pension benefits and postretirement medical
    benefits and 6.25% for postretirement life benefits.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO and net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

December 31,



Pre-Medicare eligible claims

8.5% down to 5% in 2014

9.0% down to 5% in 2014

Medicare eligible claims

10.5% down to 5% in 2018

11.0% down to 5% in 2018

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates may have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans. A

    rates would have the following effects:

Plan
    Assets

The Subsidiaries have issued group annuity and life insurance
    contracts supporting approximately 98% of all pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans assets.

The account values of the group annuity and life insurance
    contracts issued by the Subsidiaries and held as assets of the
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans were
    $7,565 million and $7,321 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of
    such account values are held in separate accounts established by
    the Subsidiaries. Total revenue from these contracts recognized
    in the consolidated statements of income was $28 million,
    $29 million and $28 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
    includes policy charges, net investment income from investments
    backing the contracts and administrative fees. Total investment
    income, including realized and unrealized gains and losses,
    credited to the account balances were $603 million,
    $818 million and $460 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The terms
    of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with
    those the Subsidiaries offer to unaffiliated parties that are
    similarly situated.

Target allocations of assets are determined with the objective
    of maximizing returns and minimizing volatility of net assets
    through adequate asset diversification. Adjustments are made to
    target allocations based on an assessment of the impact of
    economic factors and market conditions.

Cash
    Flows

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plans to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
    1974, as amended. In accordance with such practice, no
    contributions were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 or 2006. No contributions will be
    required for 2008. The Subsidiaries did not make discretionary
    contributions to the qualified pension plans during the year
    ended December 31, 2007 and made contributions of
    $350 million during the year ended December 31, 2006.
    The Subsidiaries expect to make additional discretionary
    contributions of $150 million in 2008.

Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as they become
    due under the provision of the plans. These payments totaled
    $50 million and $38 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These payments
    are expected to be at approximately the same level in 2008.

Other postretirement benefits represent a non-vested,
    non-guaranteed obligation of the Subsidiaries and current
    regulations do not require specific funding levels for these
    benefits. While the Subsidiaries have partially funded such
    plans in advance, it has been the Subsidiaries’ practice to
    primarily use their general assets, net of participant’s
    contributions, to pay postretirement medical claims as they come
    due in lieu of utilizing plan assets. Total payments equaled
    $174 million and $152 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Subsidiaries’ expect to make contributions of
    $116 million, net of participant’s contributions,
    towards the other postretirement plan obligations in 2008. As
    noted previously, the Subsidiaries expect to receive subsidies
    under the Prescription Drug Act to partially offset such
    payments.

Savings

The Subsidiaries sponsor savings and investment plans for
    substantially all employees under which a portion of employee
    contributions are matched. The Subsidiaries contributed
    $79 million, $82 million and $78 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Equity

    Stock

Issuances

In September 1999, the Holding Company adopted a stockholder
    rights plan (the “rights plan”) under which each
    outstanding share of common stock issued between April 4,
    2000 and the distribution date (as defined in the rights plan)
    will be coupled with a stockholder right. Each right will
    entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Each one
    one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock will have economic and voting terms equivalent
    to one share of common stock. Until it is exercised, the right
    itself will not entitle the holder thereof to any rights as a
    stockholder, including the right to receive dividends or to vote
    at stockholder meetings.

Stockholder rights are not exercisable until the distribution
    date, and will expire at the close of business on April 4,
    2010, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Holding
    Company. The rights plan is designed to protect stockholders in
    the event of unsolicited offers to acquire the Holding Company
    and other coercive takeover tactics.

In connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005, which is described in Note 2, the
    Holding Company issued preferred shares as follows:

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued 24 million shares
    of Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A
    (the “Series A preferred shares”) with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $600 million.

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued 60 million shares
    of 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the
    “Series B preferred shares”), with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion.

The Series A and Series B preferred shares (the
    “Preferred Shares”) rank senior to the common stock
    with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Dividends on
    the Preferred Shares are not cumulative. Holders of the
    Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments
    only when, as and if declared by the Holding Company’s
    Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the board.
    If dividends are declared on the Series A preferred shares,
    they will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual rate of
    the greater of: (i) 1.00% above

F-100


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

3-month

LIBOR on the related LIBOR determination date; or
    (ii) 4.00%. Any dividends declared on the Series B
    preferred shares will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an
    annual fixed rate of 6.50%. Accordingly, in the event that
    dividends are not declared on the Preferred Shares for payment
    on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to
    accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the
    dividend payment date, the Holding Company has no obligation to
    pay dividends accrued for that dividend period whether or not
    dividends are declared and paid in future periods. No dividends
    may, however, be paid or declared on the Holding Company’s
    common stock — or any other securities ranking junior
    to the Preferred Shares — unless the full dividends
    for the latest completed dividend period on all Preferred
    Shares, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or
    provided for.

The Holding Company is prohibited from declaring dividends on
    the Preferred Shares if it fails to meet specified capital
    adequacy, net income and shareholders’ equity levels. In
    addition, under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Holding
    Company may not be able to pay dividends if it does not earn
    sufficient operating income.

The Preferred Shares do not have voting rights except in certain
    circumstances where the dividends have not been paid for an
    equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or
    not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the
    holders of the Preferred Shares have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company.

The Preferred Shares are not subject to any mandatory
    redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or
    similar provisions. The Preferred Shares are redeemable, but not
    prior to September 15, 2010. On and after that date,
    subject to regulatory approval, the Preferred Shares will be
    redeemable at the Holding Company’s option in whole or in
    part, at a redemption price of $25 per Preferred Share, plus
    declared and unpaid dividends.

In connection with the offering of the Preferred Shares, the
    Holding Company incurred $56.8 million of issuance costs
    which have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
    capital.

Common
    Stock

Repurchases

In October 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized a $1 billion common stock repurchase program. In
    February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase program.
    In September 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase
    program which began after the completion of the $1 billion
    common stock repurchase program authorized in February 2007. In
    January 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase program,
    which began after the completion of the September 2007 program.
    (See Note 25). Under these authorizations, the Company may
    purchase its common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust,
    in the open market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set
    trading plan meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act) and in privately negotiated transactions.

The Company has entered into the following accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreements:

•

In December 2004, the Company repurchased 7.3 million
    shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of
    $300 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the stock sold to
    the Company from third parties and purchased the common stock in
    the open market to return to such third parties. In April 2005,
    the Company received a cash adjustment of $7 million based
    on the actual amount paid by the bank to purchase the common
    stock, for a final purchase price of $293 million. The
    Company recorded the shares initially repurchased as treasury
    stock and recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the
    cost of the treasury stock.

•

In December 2006, the Company repurchased 4.0 million
    shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of
    $232 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the common stock
    sold to the Company from third parties and purchased the common
    stock in the open market to return to such third parties. In
    February 2007, the Company paid a cash adjustment of
    $8 million for a final purchase price of $240 million.
    The Company recorded the shares initially repurchased as
    treasury stock and recorded the amount paid as an adjustment to
    the cost of the treasury stock.

•

In March 2007, the Company repurchased 11.9 million shares
    of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of
    $750 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the common stock
    sold to the Company from third parties and purchased common
    stock in the open market to return to such third parties. In
    June 2007, the Company paid a cash adjustment of
    $17 million for a final purchase price of
    $767 million. The Company recorded the shares initially
    repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount paid as an
    adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

•

In November 2007, the Company repurchased 11.6 million
    shares of its outstanding common stock at an initial cost of
    $750 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the stock sold to
    the Company from third parties and purchased the common stock in
    the open market to return to such third parties. Also, in
    November 2007, the Company received a cash adjustment of
    $19 million based on the trading price of the common stock
    during the repurchase period, for a final purchase price of
    $731 million. The Company recorded the shares initially
    repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount received
    as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

•

In December 2007, the Company entered into an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. Under the terms of
    the agreement, the Company paid the bank $450 million in
    cash in January 2008 in exchange for 6.6 million shares of
    the Company’s outstanding common stock that the bank
    borrowed from third parties. Also, in January 2008, the bank
    delivered 1.1 million additional shares of the
    Company’s common stock to the Company resulting in a total
    of 7.7 million shares being repurchased under the
    agreement. At December 31, 2007, the Company recorded the
    obligation to pay $450 million to the bank as a

F-102

reduction of additional paid-in capital. Upon settlement with
    the bank, the Company increased additional paid-in capital and
    reduced treasury stock.

•

See Note 25 for further information with respect to an
    accelerated common stock repurchase agreement executed
    subsequent to December 31, 2007.

The Company also repurchased 3.1 million and
    4.6 million shares through open market purchases for
    $200 million and $268 million, respectively, during
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Cumulatively, the Company repurchased 26.6 million and
    8.6 million shares of its common stock for
    $1.7 billion and $500 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company did
    not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the year
    ended December 31, 2005. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, 3.9 million,
    3.1 million and 25.0 million shares of common stock
    were issued from treasury stock for $172 million,
    $102 million and $819 million, respectively, of which
    22.4 million shares with a market value of $1 billion
    were issued in connection with the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005. See Note 2.

At December 31, 2006 the Company had $216 million
    remaining on the October 2004 common stock repurchase program
    which was subsequently reduced by $8 million to
    $208 million after the February 2007 cash adjustment to the
    December 2006 accelerated common stock repurchase agreement. The
    February 2007 stock repurchase program authorization was fully
    utilized during 2007. At December 31, 2007,
    $511 million remained on the Company’s September 2007
    common stock repurchase program. The $511 million remaining
    on the September 2007 common stock repurchase program was
    reduced by $450 million to $61 million upon settlement
    of the accelerated stock repurchase agreement executed during
    December 2007 but for which no settlement occurred until January
    2008. Subsequent to the January 2008 authorization, the amount
    remaining under these repurchase programs was
    $1,061 million. After execution of the accelerated stock
    repurchase agreement in February 2008 and certain open market
    purchases as more fully described in Note 25, the
    Company’s remaining authorization is $261 million.

Future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon several
    factors, including the Company’s capital position, its
    financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions
    and the price of the Company’s common stock.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Overview

As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(r),
    using the modified prospective transition method. The adoption
    of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant impact on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Description
    of Plans

The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
    “Stock Incentive Plan”), authorized the granting of
    awards in the form of options to buy shares of the
    Company’s common stock (“Stock Options”) that
    either qualify as incentive Stock Options under
    Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code or are
    non-qualified. The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Directors Stock Plan,
    as amended (the “Directors Stock Plan”), authorized
    the granting of awards in the form of the Company’s common
    stock, non-qualified Stock Options, or a combination of the
    foregoing to outside Directors of the Company. Under the
    MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, as
    amended (the “2005 Stock Plan”), awards granted may be
    in the form of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights,
    Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares
    or Performance Share Units, Cash-Based Awards, and Stock-Based
    Awards (each as defined in the 2005 Stock Plan). Under the
    MetLife, Inc. 2005 Non-Management Director Stock Compensation
    Plan (the “2005 Directors Stock Plan”), awards
    granted may be in the form of non-qualified Stock Options, Stock
    Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units,
    or Stock-Based Awards (each as defined in the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan). The Stock Incentive Plan,
    Directors Stock Plan, 2005 Stock Plan, the 2005 Directors
    Stock Plan and the LTPCP, as described below, are hereinafter
    collectively referred to as the “Incentive Plans.”

The aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the
    2005 Stock Plan and the LTPCP is 68,000,000, plus those shares
    available but not utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan and
    those shares utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan that are
    recovered due to forfeiture of Stock Options. Additional shares
    carried forward from the Stock Incentive Plan and available for
    issuance under the 2005 Stock Plan were 12,506,003 as of
    December 31, 2007. There were no shares carried forward
    from the Directors Stock Plan. Each share issued under the 2005
    Stock Plan in connection with a Stock Option or Stock
    Appreciation Right reduces the number of shares remaining for
    issuance under that plan by one, and each share issued under the
    2005 Stock Plan in connection with awards other than Stock
    Options or Stock Appreciation Rights reduces the number of
    shares remaining for issuance under that plan by
    1.179 shares. The number of shares reserved for issuance
    under the 2005 Directors Stock Plan are 2,000,000. As of
    December 31, 2007, the aggregate number of shares remaining
    available for issuance pursuant to the 2005 Stock Plan and the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan were 60,862,366 and 1,918,170,
    respectively.

Stock Option exercises and other stock-based awards to employees
    settled in shares are satisfied through the issuance of shares
    held in treasury by the Company. Under the current authorized
    share repurchase program, as described previously, sufficient
    treasury shares exist to satisfy foreseeable obligations under
    the Incentive Plans.

Compensation expense related to awards under the Incentive Plans
    is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest,
    which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures
    over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant.
    Unless a material deviation from the assumed rate is observed
    during the term in which the awards are expensed, any adjustment
    necessary to reflect differences in actual experience is
    recognized in the period the award becomes payable or
    exercisable. Compensation expense of $145 million,
    $144 million and $120 million, and income tax benefits
    of $51 million, $50 million and $42 million,
    related to the Incentive Plans was recognized for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Compensation expense is principally related to the issuance of
    Stock Options, Performance Shares and LTPCP arrangements.

As described in Note 1, the Company changed its policy
    prospectively for recognizing expense for stock-based awards to
    retirement eligible employees. Had the Company continued to
    recognize expense over the stated requisite service period,
    compensation expense related to the Incentive Plans would have
    been $118 million, $116 million

F-104

and $120 million, rather than $145 million,
    $144 million and $120 million, for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Had the
    Company applied the policy of recognizing expense related to
    stock-based compensation over the shorter of the requisite
    service period or the period to attainment of retirement
    eligibility for awards granted prior to January 1, 2006,
    pro forma compensation expense would have been
    $118 million, $120 million and $122 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Stock
    Options

All Stock Options granted had an exercise price equal to the
    closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on
    the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and have a
    maximum term of ten years. Certain Stock Options granted under
    the Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Stock Plan have or will
    become exercisable over a three year period commencing with the
    date of grant, while other Stock Options have or will become
    exercisable three years after the date of grant. Stock Options
    issued under the Directors Stock Plan were exercisable
    immediately. The date at which any Stock Option issued under the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan becomes exercisable would be
    determined at the time such Stock Option is granted.

A summary of the activity related to Stock Options for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 is presented below. The aggregate
    intrinsic value was computed using the closing share price on
    December 31, 2007 of $61.62 and December 29, 2006 of
    $59.01, as applicable.

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Black-Scholes model was used
    to determine the fair value of Stock Options granted and
    recognized in the financial statements or as reported in the pro
    forma disclosure which follows. The fair value of Stock Options
    issued on or after January 1, 2005 was estimated on the
    date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company made
    this change because lattice models produce more accurate option
    values due to the ability to incorporate assumptions about
    grantee exercise behavior resulting from changes in the price of
    the underlying shares. In addition, lattice models allow for
    changes in critical assumptions over the life of the option in
    comparison to closed-form models like Black-Scholes, which
    require single-value assumptions at the time of grant.

The Company used daily historical volatility since the inception
    of trading when calculating Stock Option values using the
    Black-Scholes model. In conjunction with the change to the
    binomial lattice model, the Company began estimating expected
    future volatility based upon an analysis of historical prices of
    the Holding Company’s common stock and call options on that
    common stock traded on the open market. The Company uses a
    weighted-average of the implied volatility for publicly traded
    call options with the longest remaining maturity nearest to the
    money as of each valuation date and the historical volatility,
    calculated using monthly closing prices of the Holding

F-105


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Company’s common stock. The Company chose a monthly
    measurement interval for historical volatility as it believes
    this better depicts the nature of employee option exercise
    decisions being based on longer-term trends in the price of the
    underlying shares rather than on daily price movements.

The risk-free rate is based on observed interest rates for
    instruments with maturities similar to the expected term of the
    Stock Options. Whereas the Black-Scholes model requires a single
    spot rate for instruments with a term matching the expected life
    of the option at the valuation date, the binomial lattice model
    allows for the use of different rates for each year over the
    contractual term of the option. The table below presents the
    full range of imputed forward rates for U.S. Treasury
    Strips that was used in the binomial lattice model over the
    contractual term of all Stock Options granted in the period.

Dividend yield is determined based on historical dividend
    distributions compared to the price of the underlying common
    stock as of the valuation date and held constant over the life
    of the Stock Option.

Use of the Black-Scholes model requires an input of the expected
    life of the Stock Options, or the average number of years before
    Stock Options will be exercised or expired. The Company
    estimated expected life using the historical average years to
    exercise or cancellation and average remaining years outstanding
    for vested Stock Options. Alternatively, the binomial model used
    by the Company incorporates the contractual term of the Stock
    Options and then considers expected exercise behavior and a
    post-vesting termination rate, or the rate at which vested
    options are exercised or expire prematurely due to termination
    of employment, to derive an expected life. The post-vesting
    termination rate is determined from actual historical exercise
    and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans. Exercise
    behavior in the binomial lattice model used by the Company is
    expressed using an exercise multiple, which reflects the ratio
    of exercise price to the strike price of Stock Options granted
    at which holders of the Stock Options are expected to exercise.
    The exercise multiple is derived from actual historical exercise
    activity.

The following weighted average assumptions, with the exception
    of risk-free rate, which is expressed as a range, were used to
    determine the fair value of Stock Options issued during the:

Compensation expense related to Stock Option awards expected to

    awards expected to vest and granted on or after January 1,
    2006 is recognized ratably over the requisite service period or
    the period to retirement eligibility, if shorter. Compensation
    expense of $55 million, $56 million and
    $50 million related to Stock Options was recognized for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Had compensation expense for grants awarded prior to

    the date of grant rather than the intrinsic value method, the
    Company’s earnings and earnings per common share amounts

Performance
    Shares

Beginning in 2005, certain members of management were awarded
    Performance Shares under (and as defined in) the 2005 Stock
    Plan. Participants are awarded an initial target number of
    Performance Shares with the final number of Performance Shares
    payable being determined by the product of the initial target
    multiplied by a factor of 0.0 to 2.0. The factor applied is
    based on measurements of the Company’s performance with
    respect to: (i) the change in annual net operating earnings
    per share, as defined; and (ii) the proportionate total
    shareholder return, as defined, with reference to the three-year
    performance period relative to other companies in the S&P
    Insurance Index with reference to the same three-year period.
    Performance Share awards will normally vest in their entirety at
    the end of the three-year performance period (subject to certain
    contingencies) and will be payable entirely in shares of the
    Company’s common stock.

Performance Share amounts above represent aggregate initial
    target awards and do not reflect potential increases or
    decreases resulting from the final performance factor to be
    determined at the end of the respective performance period. As
    of December 31, 2007, the three year performance period for
    the 2005 Performance Share grants was completed. Included in the
    immediately preceding table are 965,525 outstanding Performance
    Shares to which the final performance factor will be applied.
    The calculation of the performance factor is expected to be
    finalized during the second quarter of 2008 after all data
    necessary to perform the calculation is publicly available.

Performance Share awards are accounted for as equity awards but
    are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual dividends
    paid on the Holding Company’s common stock during the
    performance period. Accordingly, the fair value of Performance
    Shares is based upon the closing price of the Holding
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the
    present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock
    during the performance period.

Compensation expense related to initial Performance Shares
    granted prior to January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is
    recognized ratably during the performance period. Compensation
    expense related to initial Performance Shares granted on or
    after January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is recognized
    ratably over the performance period or the period to retirement
    eligibility, if shorter. Performance Shares expected to vest and
    the related compensation expenses may be further adjusted by the
    performance factor most likely to be achieved, as estimated by
    management, at the end of the performance period. Compensation
    expense of $90 million, $74 million and
    $24 million, related to Performance Shares was recognized
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2007, there were $57 million of
    total unrecognized compensation costs related to Performance
    Share awards. It is expected that these costs will be recognized
    over a weighted average period of 1.72 years.

Long-Term
    Performance Compensation Plan

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Company granted stock-based
    compensation to certain members of management under the LTPCP.
    Each participant was assigned a target compensation amount (an
    “Opportunity Award”) at the inception of the
    performance period with the final compensation amount determined
    based on the total shareholder return on the Company’s
    common stock over the three-year performance period, subject to
    limited further adjustment approved by the Company’s Board
    of Directors. Payments on the Opportunity Awards were normally
    payable in their entirety (subject to certain contingencies) at
    the end of the three-year performance period, and were paid in
    whole or in part with shares of the Company’s common stock,
    as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. There were
    no new grants under the LTPCP during the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

A portion of each Opportunity Award under the LTPCP was settled
    in shares of the Holding Company’s common stock while the
    remainder was settled in cash. The portion of the Opportunity
    Award settled in shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock was accounted for as an equity award with the fair value
    of the award

F-108

determined based upon the closing price of the Holding
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The
    compensation expense associated with the equity award, based
    upon the grant date fair value, was recognized into expense
    ratably over the respective three-year performance period. The
    portion of the Opportunity Award settled in cash was accounted
    for as a liability and was remeasured using the closing price of
    the Holding Company’s common stock on the final day of each
    subsequent reporting period during the three-year performance
    period.

The final LTPCP performance period concluded during the six
    months ended June 30, 2007. Final Opportunity Awards in the
    amount of 618,375 shares of the Company’s common stock
    and $16 million in cash were paid on April 18, 2007.
    No significant compensation expense related to LTPCP was
    recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Compensation expense of $14 million and $46 million,
    related to LTPCP Opportunity Awards was recognized for the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Statutory
    Equity and Income

Each insurance company’s state of domicile imposes minimum
    risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements that were
    developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”). The formulas for determining the amount of
    RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to
    financial balances or various levels of activity based on the
    perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by
    a ratio of total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to
    authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC.
    Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified
    within certain levels, each of which requires specified
    corrective action. Each of the Holding Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum RBC
    requirements for all periods presented herein.

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Codification”) in 2001. Codification was
    intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to
    state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting
    principles continue to be established by individual state laws
    and permitted practices. Modifications by the various state
    insurance departments may impact the effect of Codification on
    the statutory capital and surplus of MLIC and the Holding
    Company’s other insurance subsidiaries.

Statutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by
    charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred,
    establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different
    actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus
    instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.

In addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory
    accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The
    most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net
    deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences
    between statutory accounting principles basis and tax basis not
    expected to reverse and become recoverable within a year.
    Further, statutory accounting principles do not give recognition
    to purchase accounting adjustments.

Statutory net income of MLIC, a New York domiciled insurer, was
    $2.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $2.2 billion for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Statutory capital and surplus, as filed with the
    Department, was $13.0 billion and $9.2 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Statutory net income of MICC, a Connecticut domiciled insurer,
    was $1.1 billion and $856 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
    $470 million from the date of purchase, for the
    six month period ended December 31, 2005. Statutory
    capital and surplus, as filed with the Connecticut Insurance
    Department, was $4.2 billion and $4.1 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Due to the merger
    of MetLife Life and Annuity Company of Connecticut with MICC,
    the 2006 statutory net income balance was adjusted.

Statutory net income of MPC, a Rhode Island domiciled insurer,
    was $400 million, $385 million and $289 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Statutory capital and surplus, as

filed with the Insurance Department of Rhode Island, was
    $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Statutory net income of MTL, a Delaware domiciled insurer, was
    $103 million, $2.8 billion and $353 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Statutory capital and surplus, as filed with the
    Delaware Insurance Department was $1.1 billion and
    $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Under New York State Insurance Law, MLIC is permitted, without
    prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder
    dividends to the Holding Company as long as the aggregate amount
    of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the
    lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of
    the end of the immediately preceding calendar year; or
    (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital
    gains). MLIC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend to the
    Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only
    if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend
    and the amount thereof with the Superintendent and the
    Superintendent does not disapprove the distribution within
    30 days of its filing. Under New York State Insurance Law,
    the Superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether
    the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would
    support the payment of such dividends to its shareholders. The
    New York State Department of Insurance (the
    “Department”) has established informal guidelines for
    such determinations. The guidelines, among other things, focus
    on the insurer’s overall financial condition and
    profitability under statutory accounting practices.

Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, MICC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay shareholder
    dividends to its parent as long as the amount of such dividends,
    when aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding
    12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of
    its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain
    from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year.
    MICC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend in excess of the
    greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of its
    declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the
    Connecticut Commissioner of Insurance (“Commissioner”)
    and the Commissioner does not disapprove the payment within
    30 days after notice. In addition, any dividend that
    exceeds earned surplus (unassigned funds, reduced by 25% of

unrealized appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or
    unrealized profits on investments) as of the last filed annual
    statutory statement requires insurance regulatory approval.
    Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, the Commissioner has
    broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition
    of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of
    such dividends to its shareholders. The Connecticut State
    Insurance Law requires prior approval for any dividends for a
    period of two years following a change in control. As a result
    of the acquisition of MICC by the Holding Company on
    July 1, 2005, under Connecticut State Insurance Law, all
    dividend payments by MICC through June 30, 2007 required
    prior approval of the Commissioner.

Under Delaware State Insurance Law, Metropolitan Tower Life
    Insurance Company (“MTL”) is permitted, without prior
    insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to
    the Holding Company as long as the amount of the dividend when
    aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding
    12 months does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of
    its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain
    from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year
    (excluding realized capital gains). MTL will be permitted to pay
    a cash dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the greater
    of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration
    of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Delaware
    Commissioner of Insurance (the “Delaware
    Commissioner”) and the Delaware Commissioner does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined
    as unassigned funds) as of the last filed annual statutory
    statement requires insurance regulatory approval. Under Delaware
    State Insurance Law, the Delaware Commissioner has broad
    discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a
    stock life insurance company would support the payment of such
    dividends to its shareholders.

Under Rhode Island State Insurance Law, MPC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a
    stockholder dividend to the Holding Company as long as the
    aggregate amount of all such dividends in any twelve-month
    period does not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its
    surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) net income, not including
    realized capital gains, for the immediately preceding calendar
    year. MPC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend to the
    Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only
    if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend
    and the amount thereof with the Rhode Island Commissioner of
    Insurance (the “Rhode Island Commissioner”) and the
    Rhode Island Commissioner does not disapprove the distribution
    within 30 days of its filing. Under Rhode Island State
    Insurance Code, the Rhode Island Commissioner has broad
    discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a
    stock property and casualty insurance company would support the
    payment of such dividends to its shareholders. Because
    MPC’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2007
    excluding net realized capital gains and dividends paid, was
    negative, MPC cannot pay any dividends in 2008 without
    regulatory approval.

Business
    Segment Information

The Company is a leading provider of insurance and other
    financial services with operations throughout the United States
    and the regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The
    Company’s business is divided into five operating segments:
    Institutional, Individual, Auto & Home, International
    and Reinsurance, as well as Corporate & Other. These
    segments are managed separately because they either provide
    different products and services, require different strategies or
    have different technology requirements.

Institutional offers a broad range of group insurance and
    retirement & savings products and services, including
    group life insurance, non-medical health insurance, such as
    short and long-term disability, long-term care, and dental
    insurance, and other insurance products and services. Individual
    offers a wide variety of protection and asset accumulation
    products, including life insurance, annuities and mutual funds.
    Auto & Home provides personal lines property and
    casualty insurance, including private passenger automobile,
    homeowners and personal excess liability insurance.
    International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, annuities and retirement & savings products
    to both individuals and groups. Through the Company’s
    majority-owned subsidiary, RGA, the

F-115


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Reinsurance segment provides reinsurance of life and annuity
    policies in North America and various international markets.
    Additionally, reinsurance of critical illness policies is
    provided in select international markets.

Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not
    allocated to the business segments, various

start-up

entities, MetLife Bank and run-off entities, as well as interest
    expense related to the majority of the Company’s
    outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal
    proceedings and income tax audit issues. Corporate &
    Other also includes the elimination of all intersegment amounts,
    which generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear
    interest rates commensurate with related borrowings, as well as
    intersegment transactions. Additionally, the Company’s
    asset management business, including amounts reported as
    discontinued operations, is included in the results of
    operations for Corporate & Other. See Note 23 for
    disclosures regarding discontinued operations, including real
    estate.

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in MetLife’s businesses. As a part of the
    economic capital process, a portion of net investment income is
    credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity.

Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information
    with respect to the Company’s segments, as well as
    Corporate & Other, for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The accounting policies
    of the segments are the same as those of the Company, except for
    the method of capital allocation and the accounting for gains
    (losses) from intercompany sales, which are eliminated in
    consolidation. The Company allocates equity to each segment
    based upon the economic capital model that allows the Company to
    effectively manage its capital. The Company evaluates the
    performance of each segment based upon net income excluding net
    investment gains (losses), net of income tax, adjustments
    related to net investment gains (losses), net of income tax, the
    impact from the cumulative effect of changes in accounting, net
    of income tax and discontinued operations, other than
    discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred
    stock dividends. The Company allocates certain non-recurring
    items, such as expenses associated with certain legal
    proceedings, to Corporate & Other.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company sold its Peter Cooper
    Village and Stuyvesant Town properties located in Manhattan, New

    Stuyvesant Town properties together make up the largest
    apartment complex in Manhattan, New York totaling over
    11,000 units, spread over 80 contiguous acres. The
    properties were owned by the Company’s subsidiary, MTL. Net
    investment income on these properties was $73 million and
    $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The sale resulted in a gain of
    $3 billion, net of income tax.

In the second quarter of 2005, the Company sold its One Madison
    Avenue and 200 Park Avenue properties in Manhattan, New York for
    $918 million and $1.72 billion, respectively,
    resulting in gains, net of income tax, of $431 million and
    $762 million, respectively. Net investment income on One
    Madison Avenue and 200 Park Avenue was $13 million and
    $44 million, for the year ended December 31, 2005,

was adjusted in the fourth quarter of 2007 for additional
    transaction costs. The Company reclassified the assets and
    liabilities of the annuities and pension businesses within
    MetLife Australia, which is reported in the International
    segment, to assets and liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale
    and the operations of the business to discontinued operations
    for all periods presented. Included within the assets to be sold
    were certain fixed maturity securities in a loss position for
    which the Company recognized a net investment loss on a
    consolidated basis of $59 million, net of income tax, for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, because the Company no
    longer had the intent to hold such securities.

On January 31, 2005, the Company completed the sale of SSRM
    to a third party for $328 million in cash and stock. The
    Company reported the operations of SSRM in discontinued
    operations. As a result of the sale of SSRM, the Company
    recognized income from discontinued operations of
    $157 million, net of income tax, comprised of a realized
    gain of $165 million, net of income tax, and an operating
    expense related to a lease abandonment of $8 million, net
    of income tax. The Company’s discontinued operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 included expenses of
    $6 million, net of income tax, related to the sale of SSRM.
    Under the terms of the sale agreement, MetLife will have an
    opportunity to receive additional payments based on, among other
    things, certain revenue retention and growth measures. The
    purchase price is also subject to reduction over five years,
    depending on retention of certain MetLife-related business. In
    the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company accrued a liability for
    $2 million, net of income tax, related to the termination
    of certain MetLife-related business. Also under the terms of
    such agreement, MetLife had the opportunity to receive
    additional consideration for the retention of certain customers
    for a specific period in 2005. Upon finalization of the
    computation, the Company received payments of $30 million,
    net of income tax, in the second quarter of 2006 and
    $12 million, net of income tax, in the fourth quarter of
    2005 due to the retention of these specific customer accounts.
    In the first quarter of 2007, the Company received a payment of
    $16 million, net of income tax, as a result of the revenue
    retention and growth measure provision in the sales agreement.
    In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company eliminated
    $4 million of a liability that was previously recorded with
    respect to the indemnities provided in connection with the sale
    of SSRM, resulting in a benefit to the Company of
    $2 million, net of income tax. The Company believes that
    future payments relating to these indemnities are not probable.

The operations of SSRM include affiliated revenues of
    $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    related to asset management services provided by SSRM to the
    Company that have not been eliminated from discontinued
    operations as these transactions continued after the sale of
    SSRM. The following table presents the amounts related to
    operations of SSRM that have been combined with the discontinued
    real estate operations in the consolidated statements of income:

Fair
    Value Information

The estimated fair value of financial instruments have been
    determined by using available market information and the
    valuation methodologies described below. Considerable judgment
    is often required in interpreting market data to develop
    estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
    herein may not necessarily be indicative of amounts that could
    be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different
    assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The implementation
    of SFAS 157 may impact the fair value assumptions and
    methodologies associated with the valuation of assets and
    liabilities. See also Note 1 regarding the adoption of
    SFAS 157.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments are summarized as follows:

Fixed
    Maturity Securities, Trading Securities and Equity
    Securities

The fair values of publicly held fixed maturity securities and
    publicly held equity securities are based on quoted market
    prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However,
    in cases where quoted market prices are not available, such as
    for private fixed maturity securities, fair values are estimated
    using present value or valuation techniques. The determination
    of fair values is based on: (i) valuation methodologies;
    (ii) securities the Company deems to be comparable; and
    (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates based on available
    market information and judgments about financial instruments,
    including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future
    cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or
    counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value
    include; coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call
    provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry
    sector of the issuer, and quoted market prices of comparable
    securities.

Mortgage
    and Consumer Loans, Mortgage Loan Commitments and Commitments to
    Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans, and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

Fair values for mortgage and consumer loans are estimated by
    discounting expected future cash flows, using current interest
    rates for similar loans with similar credit risk. For mortgage
    loan commitments and commitments to fund bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments the
    estimated fair value is the net premium or discount of the
    commitments.

F-124


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Policy
    Loans

The carrying values for policy loans approximate fair value.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

The carrying values for cash and cash equivalents and short-term
    investments approximate fair values due to the short-term
    maturities of these instruments.

Accrued
    Investment Income

The carrying value for accrued investment income approximates
    fair value.

Policyholder
    Account Balances

The fair value of policyholder account balances which have final
    contractual maturities are estimated by discounting expected
    future cash flows based upon interest rates currently being
    offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with
    those remaining for the agreements being valued. The fair value
    of policyholder account balances without final contractual
    maturities are assumed to equal their current net surrender
    value.

Short-term
    and Long-term Debt, Collateral Financing Arrangements, Junior
    Subordinated Debt Securities and Shares Subject to Mandatory
    Redemption

The fair values of short-term and long-term debt, collateral
    financing arrangements, junior subordinated debt
    securities

,

and shares subject to mandatory
    redemption are determined by discounting expected future cash
    flows using risk rates currently available for debt with similar
    terms and remaining maturities.

Payables
    for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other
    Transactions

The carrying value for payables for collateral under securities
    loaned and other transactions approximate fair value.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The fair value of derivative financial instruments, including
    financial futures, financial forwards, interest rate, credit
    default and foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards,
    caps, floors, and options are based upon quotations obtained
    from dealers or other reliable sources. See Note 4 for
    derivative fair value disclosures.

Subsequent
    Events

Dividends

On February 19, 2008, the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors announced dividends of $0.3785745 per share, for a
    total of $9 million, on its Series A preferred shares,
    and $0.4062500 per share, for a total of $24 million, on
    its Series B preferred shares, subject to the final
    confirmation that it has met the financial tests specified in
    the Series A and Series B preferred shares, which the
    Holding Company anticipates will be made on or about
    March 5, 2008, the earliest date permitted in accordance
    with the terms of the securities. Both dividends will be payable
    March 17, 2008 to shareholders of record as of
    February 29, 2008.

Acquisitions

On February 1, 2008, the Company announced its completion
    of the acquisition of SafeGuard Health Enterprises, Inc.
    (“Safeguard”) for approximately $190 million.
    Safeguard is primarily involved in providing dental

F-125

    Statements — (Continued)

and vision benefit plans, including health maintenance and
    preferred provider organization plan designs and administrative
    services.

On January 2, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition
    of Afore Actinver, S.A. de C.V. (“Actinver”) for
    approximately $125 million. Actinver manages retirement accounts
    for approximately 1.1 million individuals in Mexico.

Stock
    Repurchases

On January 15, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized a $1 billion common stock repurchase program,
    which began after the completion of an earlier $1 billion
    authorization that was announced in September 2007. See
    Note 18 for further information.

As previously discussed, in December 2007, the Company entered
    into an accelerated common stock repurchase agreement with a
    major bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid
    the bank $450 million in cash in January 2008 in exchange
    for 6.6 million shares of the Company’s outstanding
    common stock that the bank borrowed from third parties. Also, in
    January 2008, the bank delivered 1.1 million additional
    shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company
    resulting in a total of 7.7 million shares being
    repurchased under the agreement. Upon settlement with the bank,
    the Company increased additional paid-in capital and reduced
    treasury stock. See Note 18 for further information.

In February 2008, the Company entered into an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. Under the
    agreement, the Company paid the bank $711 million in cash and
    the bank delivered an initial amount of 11.2 million shares
    of the Company’s outstanding common stock that the bank
    borrowed from third parties. Final settlement of the agreement
    is scheduled to take place during the first half of 2008. The
    final number of shares the Company is repurchasing under the
    terms of the agreement and the timing of the final settlement
    will depend on, among other things, prevailing market conditions
    and the market prices of the common stock during the repurchase
    period. The Company recorded the consideration paid as a
    reduction to stockholders’ equity.

From January 1, 2008 to February 25, 2008, the Company also
    repurchased 1.6 million of its shares through open market
    purchases for $89 million.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), and its subsidiaries, including
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). MetLife,
    Inc. is a leading provider of insurance and other financial
    services with operations throughout the United States and the
    regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Through its
    domestic and international subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife
    offers life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners
    insurance, retail banking and other financial services to
    individuals, as well as group insurance, reinsurance and
    retirement & savings products and services to
    corporations and other institutions.

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from Citigroup
    Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”), for $12.1 billion.
    The results of Travelers’ operations were included in the
    Company’s financial statements beginning July 1, 2005.
    As a result of the acquisition, management of the Company
    increased significantly the size and scale of the Company’s
    core insurance and annuity products and expanded the
    Company’s presence in both the retirement &
    savings domestic and international markets. The distribution
    agreements executed with Citigroup as part of the acquisition
    provide the Company with one of the broadest distribution
    networks in the industry. The initial consideration paid in 2005
    by the Holding Company for the acquisition consisted of
    $10.9 billion in cash and 22,436,617 shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock with a market value of
    $1.0 billion to Citigroup and $100 million in other
    transaction costs. Additional consideration of $115 million
    was paid by the Holding Company to Citigroup in 2006. In
    addition to cash on-hand, the purchase price was financed
    through the issuance of common stock, debt securities, common
    equity units and preferred stock.

Basis
    of Presentation

The condensed financial information of the Holding Company
    (“Parent Company Only”) should be read in conjunction
    with the Consolidated Financial Statements of MetLife, Inc. and
    subsidiaries and the notes thereto (the “Consolidated
    Financial Statements”). These condensed nonconsolidated
    financial statements reflect the results of operations,
    financial position and cash flows for the parent company only.
    Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

.

The condensed unconsolidated financial statements are prepared
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States of America (“GAAP”) except as stated
    previously which also requires management to make certain
    estimates and assumptions. The most important of these estimates
    and assumptions relate to the fair value measurements, the
    accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and
    the provision for potential losses that may arise from
    litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits, which may
    affect the amounts reported in the condensed financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from these estimates.

As described previously in Note 2 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, distribution agreements were
    executed with Citigroup as part of the Travelers’
    acquisition. Information regarding the value of distribution
    agreements (“VODA”), which are reported in other

    $3.0 billion credit agreement with various financial
    institutions, the proceeds of which are available to be used for
    general corporate purposes, to support their commercial paper
    programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. All
    borrowings under the credit agreement must be repaid by June
    2012, except that letters of credit outstanding upon termination
    may remain outstanding until June 2013. The borrowers and the
    lenders under this facility may agree to extend the term of all
    or part of the facility to no later than June 2014, except that
    letters of credit outstanding upon termination may remain
    outstanding until June 2015. The $1.5 billion credit

Related
    Party Transactions

Dividends

The primary source of the Holding Company’s liquidity is
    dividends it receives from its insurance subsidiaries. The
    Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by
    the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend
    limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is based on the
    surplus to policyholders as of the immediately preceding
    calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year. The maximum aggregate
    amount of dividends which the Holding Company subsidiaries may
    pay to the Holding Company in 2008 without insurance regulatory
    approval is $2,438 million.

Financing
    Arrangements Related to Subsidiaries

As described more fully in Note 12, Junior Subordinated
    Debentures, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements during December 2007, MetLife Capital Trust IV
    (“Trust IV”) issued exchangeable surplus trust
    securities (the “Trust Securities”) with a face
    amount of $700 million and a discount of $6 million
    ($694 million), and a fixed rate of interest of 7.875% up
    to, but not including, December 15, 2037, the scheduled
    redemption date. The beneficial interest of Trust IV held
    by the Holding Company is not represented by an investment in
    Trust IV but rather by a financing agreement between the
    Holding Company and Trust IV. The assets of Trust IV
    are $700 million of 7.375% surplus notes of MLIC, which are
    scheduled to mature December 15, 2037, and rights under the
    financing agreement. Under the financing agreement, the Holding
    Company has the obligation to make payments
    (i) semiannually at a fixed rate of 0.50% of the surplus
    notes outstanding and owned by Trust IV or if greater
    (ii) equal to the difference between the
    Trust Securities interest payment and the interest received
    by Trust IV on the surplus notes. The ability of MLIC to
    make interest and principal payments on the surplus notes to the
    Holding Company is contingent upon regulatory approval. The
    Trust Securities, will be exchanged into a like amount of
    Holding Company junior subordinated debentures on
    December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption date;
    mandatorily under certain circumstances; and at any time upon
    the Holding Company exercising its option to redeem the
    securities. The Trust Securities will be exchanged for
    junior subordinated debentures prior to repayment and the
    Holding Company is ultimately responsible for repayment of the
    junior subordinated debentures. The Holding Company’s other
    rights and obligations as it relates to the deferral of
    interest, redemption, replacement capital obligation and
    replacement capital covenant associated with the issuance of the
    Trust Securities are more fully described in Note 12
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of
    MetLife, Inc.

As described more fully in Note 11, Collateral Financing
    Arrangements, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements:

•

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of Charleston’s (“MRC”)
    reinsurance of the closed block liabilities, entered into an
    agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under which
    the Holding Company is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on
    the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 55 basis points in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 112 basis points, payable quarterly. Under this
    agreement, the Holding Company may also be required to make
    payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to
    any decline in the market value of the surplus notes and in
    connection with any early termination of this agreement. The
    Holding Company’s net cost of 57 basis points has been
    allocated to MRC. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    this amount was immaterial.

•

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, entered into
    an agreement with an unaffiliated

F-136


MetLife,
    Inc.

Schedule II

Notes to
    Condensed Financial Information — (Continued)

(Parent Company Only)

financial institution under which the Holding Company is
    entitled to the return on the investment portfolio held by the
    trust established in connection with this collateral financing
    arrangement in exchange for the payment of a stated rate of
    return to the unaffiliated financial institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 70 basis points, payable quarterly. The Holding
    Company may also be required to make payments to the
    unaffiliated financial institution, for deposit into the trust,
    related to any decline in the market value of the assets held by
    the trust, as well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early
    termination of the collateral financing arrangement. As a result
    of this agreement, the Holding Company effectively assumed the
    $2.4 billion liability under the collateral financing
    arrangement along with a beneficial interest in the trust
    holding the associated assets. The Holding Company
    simultaneously contributed to MRSC its beneficial interest in
    the trust, along with any return to be received on the
    investment portfolio held by the trust. Interest expense
    incurred by the Holding Company under the collateral financing
    arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
    $84 million. The allocation of these financing costs of
    $84 million to MRSC is included in other revenues and
    recorded as an additional investment in MRSC.

Support
    Agreements

The Holding Company, in connection with MRV’s reinsurance
    of certain universal life and term life insurance risks,
    committed to the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance,
    Securities and Health Care Administration to take necessary
    action to cause each of the two initial protected cells of MRV
    to maintain total adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200%
    of such protected cell’s authorized control
    level risk-based capital (“RBC”), as defined in
    state insurance statutes. This transaction is more fully
    described in Note 10, Long-term and Short-term Debt, of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRC’s
    reinsurance of a portion of the liabilities associated with the
    closed block, committed to the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance to make capital contributions, if necessary, to MRC so
    that MRC may at all times maintain its total adjusted capital at
    a level of not less than 200% of the company action
    level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes as in
    effect on the date of determination or December 31, 2007,
    whichever calculation produces the greater capital requirement,
    or as otherwise required by the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance. This collateral financing arrangement is more fully
    described in Note 11, Collateral Financing Arrangements, of
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC’s
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, committed to
    the South Carolina Department of Insurance to take necessary
    action to cause MRSC to maintain total adjusted capital equal to
    the greater of $250,000 or 100% of MRSC’s authorized
    control level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes.
    This collateral financing arrangement is more fully described in
    Note 11, Collateral Financing Arrangements, of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by state
    insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet
    its current obligations on a timely basis.

The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSMIC”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company agreed, without limitation as to amount, to cause MSMIC
    to

Notes to

(Parent Company Only)

have the amount of capital and surplus necessary for MSMIC to
    maintain a solvency ratio of at least 400%, as calculated in
    accordance with the Insurance Business Law of Japan, and to make
    such loans to MSMIC as may be necessary to ensure that MSMIC has
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet its payment
    obligations as they fall due.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    the Holding Company was not required to provide support to any
    of its subsidiaries under these agreements.

Controls
    and Procedures

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

There were no changes to the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f)

during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,
    estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the
    expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The
    objectives of internal control include providing management with
    reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are
    safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition,
    and that transactions are executed in accordance with
    management’s authorization and recorded properly to permit
    the preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP.

Financial management has documented and evaluated the
    effectiveness of the internal control of the Company as of
    December 31, 2007 pertaining to financial reporting in
    accordance with the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In the opinion of management, MetLife, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial
    statements and consolidated financial statement schedules
    included in the Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Report of the
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on their audit of
    the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
    statement schedules is included at

page F-1.

Attestation
    Report of the Company’s Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their
    attestation report on management’s internal control over
    financial reporting which is set forth below.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    of the Company, and our report dated February 28, 2008,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules and included an
    explanatory paragraph regarding changes in the Company’s
    method of accounting for deferred acquisition costs and for
    income taxes as required by accounting guidance adopted on
    January 1, 2007.
